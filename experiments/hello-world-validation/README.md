# Hello World Validation Experiment

This is a minimal experiment designed to validate the REM experiment framework itself.
It serves as a template for creating new experiments and a smoke test to ensure
the evaluation pipeline is functioning correctly.

## Purpose
- Verify that the `rem experiments run` command works.
- Provide specific input/output pairs to test basic matching.
- Demonstrate the directory structure.

## Setup
Run this experiment using:
```bash
rem experiments run hello-world-validation
```

## Data
- **Ground Truth**: 3 simple Q&A pairs (greeting, identity, sanity check)
- **Seed Data**: 1 test user and 1 dummy resource
