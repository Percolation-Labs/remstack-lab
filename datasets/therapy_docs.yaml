      \ 1]\nOverview of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Care Clinical Guidelines: \n\
      A Resource for States Developing SUD Delivery System Reforms \nApril 2017 \n\
      For the past two years, the Medicaid Innovation Accelerator Program (IAP) has\
      \ been providing a \nbroad group of state Medicaid and behavioral health agencies\
      \ with a variety of technical support \nresources to support the development\
      \ of robust approaches for addressing substance use disorders \n(SUD). In addition,\
      \ IAP has also been working directly with a small group of leader states on\
      \ \nissues related to reducing substance use disorders, as well as with a number\
      \ of states to assist with \ntheir planning and development of section 1115\
      \ demonstration proposals focusing on SUD.1 \nThrough our close work with states\
      \ under various IAP SUD activities, we have developed tools \nand resources\
      \ such as this one designed to support state efforts to introduce policy, program\
      \ and \npayment reforms appropriate for a robust SUD delivery system.  \nThe\
      \ purpose of this resource is to support states in their ongoing efforts to\
      \ introduce SUD service \ncoverage and delivery system reforms by providing\
      \ information about the preventive, treatment \nand recovery services and the\
      \ levels of care comprising the continuum of SUD care. This \ndocument also\
      \ provides an overview of nationally developed guidelines for SUD treatment\
      \ criteria, \nincluding provider and service standards for each level of care.\
      \ In addition, it provides useful tools \nand examples of state-based initiatives\
      \ that can assist states in their efforts to ensure that care is \ndelivered\
      \ consistent with industry standard SUD treatment guidelines and that Medicaid\
      \ \nbeneficiaries receive the most appropriate services given their treatment\
      \ and recovery needs. \n                                                   \

      \ \nNeeds assessments and other research have shown that not all state Medicaid\
      \ programs offer the \nfull continuum of services needed by individuals with\
      \ a SUD.2 3 The SUD continuum of services \nshould include interventions that\
      \ are capable of meeting the various types of individual’s needs, \nincluding\
      \ various levels of care. As individuals move throughout the continuum in their\
      \ recovery \nfrom SUD, they may need to transition to levels of care of greater\
      \ or lesser intensity, depending on \ntheir clinical needs. \nAn example of\
      \ patient flow throughout the SUD care continuum can illustrate how important\
      \ \nservice coverage of the full range of care is to appropriately treating\
      \ SUD. An individual with \nSUD may be admitted to a medically managed withdrawal\
      \ management or inpatient facility with \nacute physical health care needs requiring\
      \ medical and nursing care. Once medically stable, the \nindividual may next\
      \ need a clinically managed adult residential program for treatment services\
      \ or \nan intensive outpatient or outpatient program that includes medication\
      \ assisted treatment (MAT). \nAlternatively, an individual with SUD may begin\
      \ treatment by receiving outpatient treatment \nservices only to find that a\
      \ more intensive level of care, such as intensive outpatient treatment, is \n\
      more appropriate. Without the ability to transition to less or more intensive\
      \ levels of care \nthroughout treatment in response to changing clinical needs\
      \ and treatment goals, individuals with \nSUD face higher risk of relapse and\
      \ worse behavioral and physical health outcomes, including \nincreased inpatient\
      \ hospital utilization.4 5 \nThrough our work with states, we have found that\
      \ comparing existing Medicaid SUD benefits \nside- by-side with the nationally\
      \ developed SUD care continuum is a useful exercise for \nidentifying how well\
      \ service coverage aligns to the full continuum of SUD services. This will \n\
      allow states to identify any gaps in their coverage and review their inventory\
      \ of SUD providers \nthat offer these services. Included in this document is\
      \ a template that can be used to crosswalk \nstate Medicaid coverage of SUD\
      \ services with the continuum of care described in the American \nSociety of\
      \ Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Criteria (see Appendix One). \nIn addition to aligning\
      \ benefits coverage with nationally accepted guidelines, states can also assess\
      \ \ntheir program standards to ensure that SUD service provision adheres to\
      \ the industry standards. \nSpecifically, states can review their licensure\
      \ standards, regulations, policy, provider manuals and \ncontracts, managed\
      \ care contracts, or other program guidance to determine if requirements for\
      \ \nSUD providers and services comport with important provider and service standards\
      \ in the ASAM \nCriteria. This document provides a brief overview of these provider\
      \ competencies, and includes \noptional resources that states can use to conduct\
      \ such reviews (see Appendix Two). \nThese two core features—offering service\
      \ coverage for the full continuum of care and aligning \n                  \

      \ of the hallmarks of a \ntransformed system of care for individuals with SUD.\
      \  \nASAM CRITERIA \nThe ASAM Criteria: Treatment Criteria for Addictive Substance-Related,\
      \ and Co-Occurring \nCondition 6 (henceforth called the ASAM Criteria) contains\
      \ the most recent set of industry \nguidelines released on the treatment of\
      \ SUDs. This resource provides a brief overview of the key \nprovider competencies\
      \ described in the ASAM Criteria. The Medicaid IAP appreciates the \ninformal\
      \ review, edits and contributions provided by ASAM to the clinical summaries\
      \ included \nbelow. \nThe content included in this document is an abbreviation\
      \ of the full principles, concepts, and \nprocess described within the ASAM\
      \ Criteria. Furthermore, the summary information in this \ndocument is based\
      \ on the latest science available at the time of its release (the third edition\
      \ of \nthe ASAM Criteria) and will need to be updated upon subsequent editions\
      \ and the \navailability of new research and science. \nThe ASAM Criteria describes\
      \ five broad levels of care (Levels 0.5–4) with specific service and \nrecommended\
      \ provider requirements to meet those needs. These levels of care (Levels 0.5–4)\
      \ span \na continuum of care that represent various levels of care. A full list\
      \ of the levels of care is provided \nin Figure 1, with more in-depth descriptions\
      \ following this section.7 \n                                              \

      \n[Page 4]\n4 \nFigure 1. ASAM Levels of Care\n\n[Page 5]\n5 \n \n \nDefinition\
      \ of Treatment Terms \nThroughout the ASAM Criteria, the following treatment\
      \ terms are used to describe services \nwithin a specified level of care: \n\
      • Clinically managed services are directed by nonphysician addiction specialists\
      \ rather than \nmedical personnel. They are appropriate for individuals whose\
      \ primary problems involve \nemotional, behavioral, cognitive, readiness to\
      \ change, relapse, or recovery environment \nconcerns. Intoxication, withdrawal,\
      \ and biomedical concerns, if present, are safely \nmanageable in a clinically\
      \ managed service. This type of care is described under Level 3.1, \n3.3 and\
      \ 3.5 residential programs. \n• Medically monitored services are provided by\
      \ an interdisciplinary staff of nurses, \ncounselors, social workers, addiction\
      \ specialists, or other health and technical personnel \nunder the direction\
      \ of a licensed physician. Medical monitoring is provided through an \nappropriate\
      \ mix of direct patient contact, review of records, team meetings, 24-hour \n\
      coverage by a physician, 24-hour nursing and a quality assurance program. This\
      \ type of \ncare is described under Level 3.7 inpatient programs. \n• Medically\
      \ managed services involve daily medical care and 24-hour nursing. An \nappropriately\
      \ trained and licensed physician provides diagnostic and treatment services\
      \ \ndirectly, manages the provision of those services, or both. This type of\
      \ care is described \nunder Level 4 medically managed intensive inpatient programs.\
      \ \n \nLevel 0.5: Early Intervention \nProfessional services targeting individuals\
      \ who are at risk of developing a substance-related \nproblem but may not have\
      \ a diagnosed SUD are provided in Level 0.5. These early intervention \nservices—including\
      \ individual or group counseling, motivational interventions, and Screening,\
      \ \nBrief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT)—seek to identify substance-related\
      \ risk \nfactors to help individuals recognize the potentially harmful consequences\
      \ of high-risk behaviors. \nThese services may be coverable under Medicaid as\
      \ stand-alone direct services or may also be \ncoverable as component services\
      \ of a program such as driving under the influence or driving while \nintoxicated\
      \ programs and Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs). Length of service may vary\
      \ \nfrom 15 to 60 minutes of SBIRT, provided once or over five brief motivational\
      \ sessions, to several \nweeks of services provided in programs. Medicaid coverage\
      \ of services and component services, \nwhether provided directly or through\
      \ programs, must comport with all applicable rules, such as \nstate plan benefit\
      \ requirements. \n• Setting: Early intervention services are often provided\
      \ in nonspecialty settings including \nprimary care medical clinics, hospital\
      \ emergency departments, community centers, \nworksites, or an individual’s\
      \ home. SBIRT may be conducted in a primary care physician’s \noffice, mental\
      \ health practice, trauma center, emergency department, school setting, or \n\
      other nonaddiction treatment environments. \n• Provider Type: Appropriately\
      \ credentialed and/or licensed treatment professionals, \nincluding addiction\
      \ counselors, social workers, or health educators may offer early"

      \ \n \nintervention services. SBIRT activities are often provided by generalist\
      \ health care \nprofessionals or addiction counselors who are knowledgeable\
      \ about substance use and \naddictive disorders, motivational counseling, and\
      \ the legal and personal consequences of \nhigh-risk behavior. \n• Treatment\
      \ Goal: Individual, group, or family counseling and SBIRT services should \n\
      educate individuals about the risks of substance use and help them avoid such\
      \ behavior. \nSBIRT services aim to intervene early, linking individuals with\
      \ SUDs to appropriate formal \ntreatment programs. \n \nLevel 1: Outpatient\
      \ Services \nLevel 1 is appropriate in many situations as an initial level of\
      \ care for patients with less severe \ndisorders; for those who are in early\
      \ stages of change, as a “step down” from more intensive \nservices; or for\
      \ those who are stable and for whom ongoing monitoring or disease management\
      \ is \nappropriate. Adult services for Level 1 programs are provided less than\
      \ 9 hours weekly, and \nadolescents’ services are provided less than 6 hours\
      \ weekly; individuals recommended for more \nintensive levels of care may receive\
      \ more intensive services. \n• Setting: Outpatient services are often delivered\
      \ in a wide variety of settings such as offices, \nclinics, school-based clinics,\
      \ primary care clinics, and other facilities offering additional \ntreatment\
      \ or mental health programs. \n• Provider Type: Appropriately credentialed and/or\
      \ licensed treatment professionals, \nincluding counselors, social workers,\
      \ psychologists, and physicians (whether addiction- \ncredentialed or generalist)\
      \ deliver outpatient services, including medication and disease \nmanagement\
      \ services. \n• Treatment Goal: Outpatient services are designed to help patients\
      \ achieve changes in \nalcohol and/or drug use and addictive behaviors and often\
      \ address issues that have the \npotential to undermine the patient’s ability\
      \ to cope with life tasks without the addictive use \nof alcohol, other drugs,\
      \ or both. \n• Therapies: Level 1 outpatient services may offer several therapies\
      \ and service components, \nincluding individual and group counseling, motivational\
      \ enhancement, family therapy, \neducational groups, occupational and recreational\
      \ therapy, psychotherapy, MAT, or other \nskilled treatment services. \n \n\
      Level 2: Intensive Outpatient and Partial Hospitalization Programs \nLevel 2\
      \ programs provide essential addiction education and treatment components and\
      \ have two \ngradations of intensity. Level 2.1 intensive outpatient programs\
      \ provide 9–19 hours of weekly \nstructured programming for adults or 6–19 hours\
      \ of weekly structured programming for \nadolescents. Programs may occur during\
      \ the day or evening, on the weekend, or after school for \nadolescents. \n\
      Level 2.1: Intensive Outpatient Programs \n• Setting: Intensive outpatient programs\
      \ are primarily delivered by substance use disorder"

      \ \n \noutpatient specialty providers, but may be delivered in any appropriate\
      \ setting that meets \nstate licensure or certification requirements. These\
      \ programs have direct affiliation with \nprograms offering more and less intensive\
      \ levels of care as well as supportive housing \nservices. \n• Provider Type:\
      \ Interdisciplinary team of appropriately credentialed addiction treatment \n\
      professionals including counselors, psychologists, social workers, addiction-credentialed\
      \ \nphysicians, and program staff, many of whom have cross-training to aid in\
      \ interpreting \nmental disorders and deliver intensive outpatient services.\
      \ \n• Treatment Goal: At a minimum, this level of care provides a support system\
      \ including \nmedical, psychological, psychiatric, laboratory, and toxicology\
      \ services within 24 hours by \ntelephone or within 72 hours in person. Emergency\
      \ services are available at all times, and \nthe program should have direct\
      \ affiliation with more or less intensive care levels and \nsupportive housing.\
      \ \n• Therapies: Level 2.1 intensive outpatient services include individual\
      \ and group counseling, \neducational groups, occupational and recreational\
      \ therapy, psychotherapy, MAT, \nmotivational interviewing, enhancement and\
      \ engagement strategies, family therapy, or \nother skilled treatment services.\
      \ \nLevel 2.5: Partial Hospitalization Programs. \nLevel 2.5 partial hospital\
      \ programs differ from Level 2.1 intensive outpatient programs in the \nintensity\
      \ of clinical services that are directly provided by the program, including\
      \ psychiatric, \nmedical and laboratory services. Partial hospitalization programs\
      \ are appropriate for patients who \nare living with unstable medical and psychiatric\
      \ conditions. Partial hospitalization programs are \nable to provide 20 hours\
      \ or more of clinically intensive programming each week to support patients\
      \ \nwho need daily monitoring and management in a structured outpatient setting.\
      \ \n• Setting: Structured outpatient setting that offers direct access to psychiatric,\
      \ medical and \nlaboratory services. Such programs may be freestanding or located\
      \ within a larger \nhealthcare system so long as the partial hospitalization\
      \ unit is distinctly organized from the \nrest of the available programs. These\
      \ programs have direct affiliation with programs \noffering more and less intensive\
      \ levels of care as well as supportive housing services. \n• Provider Type:\
      \ Similar to Level 2.1, partial hospitalization services are delivered by an\
      \ \ninterdisciplinary team of providers, with some cross-training to identify\
      \ mental disorders \nand potential issues related to prescribed psychotropic\
      \ drug treatment in populations with \nSUD. Additionally, these programs must\
      \ support access to more and less intensive \nprograms as well as supportive\
      \ housing services. One major distinction from Level 2.1 is \nthe requirement\
      \ for qualified practitioners in partial hospitalization programs to provide\
      \ \nmedical, psychological, psychiatric, laboratory, toxicology and emergency\
      \ services. \n• Treatment Goal: At a minimum, this level of care meets the same\
      \ treatment goals as \ndescribed for Level 2.1, with psychiatric and other medical\
      \ consultation services available \nwithin 8 hours by telephone or within 48\
      \ hours in person. \n• Therapies: Level 2.5 intensive outpatient services include\
      \ individual and group counseling, \neducational groups, occupational and recreational\
      \ therapy, psychotherapy, MAT, \nmotivational interviewing, motivational enhancement\
      \ and engagement strategies, family"

      \ \n \ntherapy, or other skilled treatment services. \n \nLevel 3: Residential\
      \ or Inpatient Programs \nLevel 3 programs include four sublevels that represent\
      \ a range of intensities of service.  The \nuniting feature is that these services\
      \ all are provided in a structured, residential setting that is \nstaffed 24\
      \ hours daily and are clinically managed (see definition of terms above).  Residential\
      \ \nlevels of care provide a safe, stable environment that is critical to individuals\
      \ as they begin their \nrecovery process. Level 3.1 programs are appropriate\
      \ for patients whose recovery is aided by a \ntime spent living in a stable,\
      \ structured environment where they can practice coping skills, self- \nefficacy,\
      \ and make connections to the community including work, education and family\
      \ systems.  \nLevel 3.1: Clinically Managed Low-Intensity Residential Programs\
      \ \n• Setting: Services are provided in a 24-hour environment, such as a group\
      \ home. Both \nclinic-based services and community-based recovery services are\
      \ provided. Clinically, \nLevel 3.1 requires at least 5 hours of low-intensity\
      \ treatment services per week, including \nmedication management, recovery skills,\
      \ relapse prevention, and other similar services. In \nLevel 3.1, the 5 or more\
      \ hours of clinical services may be provided onsite or in \ncollaboration with\
      \ an outpatient services agency. \n• Provider Type: Team of appropriately credentialed\
      \ medical, addiction, and mental health \nprofessionals provide clinical services.\
      \ Allied health professional staff including counselors \nand group living workers\
      \ and some clinical staff knowledgeable about biological and \npsychosocial\
      \ dimensions of SUD and psychiatric conditions support the recovery residence\
      \ \ncomponent of care. \n• Treatment Goal: Patients receive individual, group,\
      \ or family therapy, or some \ncombination thereof; medication management; and\
      \ psychoeducation to develop recovery, \nrelapse prevention, and emotional coping\
      \ techniques. Treatment should promote personal \nresponsibility and reintegrate\
      \ the patient to work, school, and family environments. At a \nminimum, this\
      \ level of care provides telephone and in-person physician and emergency \n\
      services 24-hours daily, offers direct affiliations with other levels of care,\
      \ and is able to \narrange necessary lab or pharmacotherapy procedures. \n•\
      \ \nTherapies: Level 3.1 clinically managed low-intensity residential services\
      \ are designed to \nimprove the patient’s ability to structure and organize\

      \ \n \nLevel 3.3: Clinically Managed Population-Specific High-Intensity Residential\
      \ Programs \n(specified for adults only) \nThis gradation of residential treatment\
      \ is specifically designed for specific population of adult \npatients with\
      \ significant cognitive impairments resulting from substance use or other co-occurring\
      \ \ndisorders. This level of care is appropriate when an individual’s temporary\
      \ or permanent cognitive \nlimitations make it unlikely for them to benefit\
      \ from other residential levels of care that offer group \ntherapy and other\
      \ cognitive-based relapse prevention strategies. These cognitive impairments\
      \ may \nbe seen in individuals who suffer from an organic brain syndrome as\
      \ a result of substance use, who \nsuffer from chronic brain syndrome, who have\
      \ experienced a traumatic brain injury, who have \ndevelopmental disabilities,\
      \ or are older adults with age and substance-related cognitive limitations.\
      \ \nIndividuals with temporary limitations receive slower paced, repetitive\
      \ treatment until the \nimpairment subsides and s/he is able to progress onto\
      \ another level of care appropriate for her/his \nSUD treatment needs. \n• Setting:\
      \ Services are often provided in a structured, therapeutic rehabilitation facility\
      \ and \ntraumatic brain injury programs located within a community setting,\
      \ or in specialty units \nlocated within licensed healthcare facilities where\
      \ high-intensity clinical services are \nprovided in a manner that meets the\
      \ functional limitations of patients. Such programs have \ndirect affiliation\
      \ with more or less intensive levels of care as well as supportive services\
      \ \nrelated to employment, literacy training and adult education. \n• Provider\
      \ Type: Physicians, physician extenders, and appropriate credentialed mental\
      \ \nhealth professionals lead treatment. On-site 24-hour allied health professional\
      \ staff \nsupervise the residential component with access to clinicians competent\
      \ in SUD treatment. \nClinical staff knowledgeable about biological and psychosocial\
      \ dimensions of SUD and \npsychiatric conditions who have specialized training\
      \ in behavior management support care. \nPatients have access to additional\
      \ medical, laboratory, toxicology, psychiatric and \npsychological services\
      \ through consultations and referrals. \n• Treatment Goal: Specialized services\
      \ are provided at a slower pace and in a repetitive \nmanner to overcome comprehension\
      \ and coping challenges. This level of care is \nappropriate until the cognitive\
      \ impairment subsides, enabling the patient to engage in \nmotivational relapse\
      \ prevention strategies delivered in other levels of care. \n• Therapies: Level\
      \ 3.3 clinically managed population-specific high-intensity residential \nservices\
      \ may be provided in a deliberately repetitive fashion to address the special\
      \ needs of \nindividuals for whom a Level 3.3 program is considered medically\
      \ necessary. Daily clinical \nservices designed to improve the patient’s ability\
      \ to structure and organize the tasks of daily \nliving and recovery, to stabilize\
      \ and maintain the stability of the individual’s substance use \ndisorder symptoms,\
      \ and to help them develop and apply recovery skills are provided. The \nskilled\
      \ treatment services include a range of cognitive, behavioral and other therapies\
      \ \nadministered on an individual and group basis; medication management and\
      \ medication \neducation; counseling and clinical monitoring; educational groups;\
      \ occupational and \nrecreational therapies; art, music or movement therapies;\
      \ physical therapy; clinical and \ndidactic motivational interventions; and\
      \ related services directed exclusively toward the \nbenefit of the Medicaid-eligible\
      \ individual."

      10 \n \nLevel 3.5: Clinically Managed Residential Programs (high intensity for\
      \ adults, medium intensity \nfor adolescents) \nThis gradation of residential\
      \ programming is appropriate for individuals in some imminent danger \nwith\
      \ functional limitations who cannot safely be treated outside of a 24-hour stable\
      \ living \nenvironment that promotes recovery skill development and deters relapse.\
      \ Patients receiving this \nlevel of care have severe social and psychological\
      \ conditions. This level of care is appropriate for \nadolescents with patterns\
      \ of maladaptive behavior, temperament extremes and/or cognitive \ndisability\
      \ related to mental health disorders. \n• Setting: Services are often provided\
      \ in freestanding, licensed facilities located in a \ncommunity setting or a\
      \ specialty unit within a licensed health care facility. Such programs \nrely\
      \ on the treatment community as a therapeutic agent. \n• Provider Type: Interdisciplinary\
      \ team is made up of appropriately credentialed clinical \nstaff including addictions\
      \ counselors, social workers, and licensed professional counselors, \nand allied\
      \ health professionals who provide residential oversight. Telephone or in-person\
      \ \nconsultation with a physician is a required support, but -on-site physicians\
      \ are not required. \n• Treatment Goal: Comprehensive, multifaceted treatment\
      \ is provided to individuals with \npsychological problems, and chaotic or unsupportive\
      \ interpersonal relationships, criminal \njustice histories, and antisocial\
      \ value systems. The level of current instability is of such \nseverity that\
      \ the individual is in imminent danger if not in a 24-hour treatment setting.\
      \ \nTreatment promotes abstinence from substance use, arrest, and other negative\
      \ behaviors to \neffect change in the patients’ lifestyle, attitudes, and values,\
      \ and focuses on stabilizing \ncurrent severity and preparation to continue\
      \ treatment in less intensive levels of care. \n• Therapies: Level 3.5 clinically\
      \ managed residential services are designed to improve the \npatient’s ability\
      \ to structure and organize the tasks of daily living, stabilize and maintain\
      \ the \nstability of the individual’s substance use disorder symptoms, to help\
      \ them develop and \napply sufficient recovery skills, and to develop and practice\
      \ prosocial behaviors such that \nimmediate or imminent return to substance\
      \ use upon transfer to a less intensive level is \navoided. The skilled treatment\
      \ services include a range of cognitive, behavioral and other \ntherapies administered\
      \ on an individual and group basis; medication management and \nmedication education;\
      \ counseling and clinical monitoring; random drug screening; planned \nclinical\
      \ activities and professional services to develop and apply recovery skills;\
      \ family \ntherapy; educational groups; occupational and recreational therapies;\
      \ art, music or \nmovement therapies; physical therapy; and related services\
      \ directed exclusively toward the \nbenefit of the Medicaid-eligible individual.\
      \ \nLevel 3.7: Medically Monitored Inpatient Programs (intensive for adults,\
      \ high-intensity for \nadolescents) \nThis level of care is appropriate for\
      \ patients with biomedical, emotional, behavioral and/or \ncognitive conditions\
      \ that require highly structured 24-hour services including direct evaluation,\
      \ \nobservation, and medically monitored addiction treatment. Medically monitored\
      \ treatment is \nprovided through a combination of direct patient contact, record\
      \ review, team meetings and quality \nassurance programming. These services\
      \ are differentiated from Level 4.0 in that the population \nserved does not\
      \ have conditions severe enough to warrant medically managed inpatient services\
      \ or \nacute care in a general hospital where daily treatment decisions are\
      \ managed by a physician."

      \ toward the \nbenefit of the Medicaid-eligible individual. \n \nLevel 4: Medically\
      \ Managed Intensive Inpatient Programs \nThis level of care is appropriate for\
      \ patients with biomedical, emotional, behavioral and/or \ncognitive conditions\
      \ severe enough to warrant primary medical care and nursing care. Services \n\
      offered at this level differ from Level 3.7 services in that patients receive\
      \ daily direct care from a \nlicensed physician who is responsible for making\
      \ shared treatment decisions with the patient (i.e. \nmedically managed care).\
      \ These services are provided in a hospital-based setting and include \nmedically\
      \ directed evaluation and treatment. \n• Setting: Services may be provided in\
      \ an acute care general hospital, an acute psychiatric \nhospital, or a psychiatric\
      \ unit within an acute care general hospital, or through a licensed \naddiction\
      \ treatment specialty hospital. \n• Provider Type: Interdisciplinary team is\
      \ made up of appropriately credentialed clinical staff \nincluding addiction-credentialed\
      \ physicians who are available 24 hours daily, nurse \npractitioners, physicians’\
      \ assistants, nurses, counselors, psychologists, and social workers. \nSome\
      \ staff are cross-trained to identify and treat signs of comorbid mental disorders.\
      \ \n• Treatment Goal: Addiction services including medically directed acute\
      \ withdrawal \nmanagement are provided in conjunction with intensive medical\
      \ and psychiatric services to \nalleviate patients’ acute emotional, behavioral,\
      \ and cognitive distresses associated with the \nSUD whose acute medical, emotional,\
      \ behavioral and cognitive problems are so severe that\n\n[Page 12]\n12 \n \n\
      they require primary medical and 24-hour nursing care. Because the length of\
      \ stay in a Level \n4 program typically is sufficient only to stabilize the\
      \ individual’s acute signs and symptoms, \na primary focus of the treatment\
      \ plan is case management and coordination of care to ensure \na smooth transition\
      \ to continuing treatment at another level of care. \n• Therapies: Cognitive,\
      \ behavioral, motivational, pharmacologic and other therapies provided \non\
      \ an individual or group basis; physical health interventions; health education\
      \ services; \nplanned clinical interventions; and services for the patient’s\

      \ MANAGEMENT LEVELS OF CARE \nThe ASAM Criteria includes five levels of withdrawal\
      \ management services, which are described \nas if they were provided separately\
      \ from the aforementioned level-of-care services available to \nmanage SUDs.\
      \ However, these services are routinely provided concurrently with other addiction\

      14 \n \nStaffing requirements differ according to the level of withdrawal management\
      \ services required. \nFor example, readily available physicians and nurses\
      \ are required for outpatient withdrawal \nmanagement, whereas social residential\
      \ withdrawal management requires only that such personnel \nbe available for\
      \ consultation if protocols are in place and the care setting is staffed by\
      \ appropriately \ncredentialed and trained counselors.8  \n \nOPIOID TREATMENT\
      \ SERVICES \nOpioid treatment services (OTS) is a broad term describing MAT\
      \ options for opioid use disorders \nand the psychosocial supports and services\
      \ provided in concert with pharmacological treatment. \nTwo categories of MAT\
      \ options exist for opioid use disorders–opioid agonists and antagonists. \n\
      Opioid agonist medications such as methadone and buprenorphine occupy and partially\
      \ activate \nopioid receptors in the brain. These medications reduce opioid\
      \ cravings and relieve withdrawal \nsymptoms without producing a state of intoxication.\
      \ As agonist medications, methadone and \nbuprenorphine are covered under the\
      \ Controlled Substances Act, which means that providers must \nmeet certain\
      \ regulatory requirements to prescribe them. Conversely, opioid antagonist medications\
      \ \nsuch as naltrexone are not covered by the Controlled Substances Act. These\
      \ medications occupy, \nbut do not activate opioid receptors, thereby preventing\
      \ the brain from responding to opioids and \npreventing intoxication when opioids\
      \ are used. \nHealth care facilities that provide access to opioid agonists\
      \ like methadone and buprenorphine are \ncategorized as either opioid treatment\
      \ programs (OTPs) or office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) \nmodels. \nOpioid\
      \ Treatment Programs \nOTPs, commonly known as methadone maintenance treatment\
      \ clinics or opioid maintenance \ntherapy clinics, directly administer MAT (primarily\
      \ methadone) to patients on a daily basis. Thus \nindividuals receiving medication\
      \ from OTPs are not required to take a prescription to any \noutpatient dispensing\
      \ pharmacy. Due to this organizational structure, OTPs are heavily regulated\
      \ \nby federal and state agencies. OTPs are appropriate for individuals who\
      \ are assessed as meeting the \ndiagnostic criteria for a severe opioid use\
      \ disorder. \n• Setting: Dispensing of methadone is conducted in licensed permanent,\
      \ freestanding clinics, \ncommunity mental health centers, community health\
      \ centers, hospital medication units or \nsatellite clinics, mobile units attached\
      \ to permanent clinic sites, or inpatient settings that \nmeet criteria set\
      \ by 42 CFR 8. These facilities are highly structured, ambulatory addiction\
      \ \ntreatment service centers, such as Level 1 outpatient settings, that may\
      \ require patients’ \ndaily attendance to receive medication. Patients more\
      \ established in their treatment \neventually may receive “take home” medication\
      \ supplies for limited durations, such as a \nweekend. \n                  \
      \                                   \n8 More information on specific withdrawal\
      \ management levels of care is available from Mee-Lee D, ed. The ASAM \nCriteria:\
      \ Treatment Criteria for Addictive Substance-Related, and Co-Occurring Conditions.\

      15 \n \n• Provider Type: Interdisciplinary teams of personnel trained in opioid\
      \ use disorder \ntreatment include a medical director, physicians, nurses, licensed\
      \ or certified addictions \ncounselors, licensed psychologists, mental health\
      \ therapists, and social workers. Team \nmembers are knowledgeable in the assessment,\
      \ interpretation, and treatment of substance \nuse disorders. Patients have\
      \ access to physiological, medical, and psychiatric consultation \nservices\
      \ that include emergency care, primary medical care, and laboratory and toxicology\
      \ \nservices. \n• Treatment Goal: MAT is provided to address patients’ need\
      \ to eliminate the use of illicit \ndrugs that could hinder recovery as well\
      \ as the ability to achieve an improved level of \nfunctioning for major life\
      \ tasks. A patient-centered treatment plan is developed to address \nlifestyle,\
      \ attitudinal, and behavioral issues that may interfere with recovery or life\
      \ tasks. \nTreatment duration is based on individual patient needs, but it is\
      \ often long-term to achieve \nstabilization and may be lifelong to prevent\
      \ relapse. \n• Therapies: Individualized, patient-centered evaluation and treatment\
      \ includes assessing, \nordering, administering, reassessing, and regulating\
      \ medication type and dose levels. \nPatients receive addiction counseling,\
      \ mental health therapy, case management, health \neducation, referral to other\
      \ levels of care, and medication provision for comorbid physical \nand mental\
      \ health disorders. Federal regulations require regular psychosocial treatment\
      \ \nsessions, scheduled medication visits, and random urine drug screenings.\
      \ Supervised \nwithdrawal management from opioid analgesics including methadone\
      \ and buprenorphine \nalso is provided. \nOffice-Based Opioid Treatment Models\
      \ \nThe OBOT model of care allows waivered physicians in office-based settings\
      \ and in private or \npublic clinics to prescribe outpatient supplies of buprenorphine.\
      \ However, waivered physicians are \nnot permitted to prescribe in inpatient\
      \ settings. Physicians must complete an eight-hour training \napproved by the\
      \ Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and must submit their training credits\
      \ to \nthe Drug Enforcement Agency to achieve waiver status that allows them\
      \ to prescribe \nbuprenorphine. Overall, federal regulation applies to the prescribing\
      \ physician rather than the \nfacility where s/he is practicing.9  \n• Setting:\
      \ Patients are prescribed medication in a certified and waivered physician’s\
      \ office or \nclinic. Medication is commonly dispensed in an outpatient retail\
      \ pharmacy or by a \npharmaceutical distributor or the prescribing physician,\
      \ depending on local regulations. \n• \nProvider Type: Waivered physicians also\
      \ must demonstrate established referral \nrelationships with psychosocial counseling\
      \ services, including treatment modalities in \nLevels 1-4 that may be affiliated\
      \ with a sponsoring OTP. Eligible waivered physicians \ncurrently are capped\
      \ at prescribing buprenorphine to 275 patients. In 2016 the \nComprehensive\
      \ Addiction and Recovery Act expanded prescribing privileges to waivered \n\
      nurse practitioners and physician assistants until 2021.10  \n             \
      \                                        \n9 Nurse practitioners and physician\

      16 \n \n• Treatment Goal: MAT is integrated into patients’ general medical and\
      \ psychiatric care. \nStabilized patients, including those referred from OTPs,\
      \ continue to receive \npharmacological treatment and ancillary psychosocial\
      \ treatment services as needed. \n• Therapies: Individualized, patient-centered\
      \ evaluation and treatment includes assessing, \nprescribing, administering,\
      \ reassessing, and regulating medication type and dose levels as \nwell as providing\
      \ or referring for psychosocial treatments. OBOT providers may perform \nmedication\
      \ management for comorbid physical and mental health disorders if they are the\
      \ \npatient’s primary care physician or psychiatrist. \nEXAMPLES OF STATE SUBSTANCE\
      \ USE DISORDER PROGRAM STANDARDS \nAs discussed above, the levels of care described\
      \ in the ASAM Criteria may be used as a basis for \ndesigning Medicaid SUD benefits\
      \ as part of a strategy to provide service coverage for the full \ncontinuum\
      \ of care. In addition, the provider and service recommendations corresponding\
      \ to each \nASAM level of care can be used as a basis for designing Medicaid\
      \ SUD program standards as part \nof a strategy to promote quality of addiction\
      \ care. A number of state policy levers are available for \nthis purpose, including\
      \ licensure standards, regulations, policy guidance, provider manuals and \n\
      contracts, managed care contracts, and other program guidance. \nWe have found\
      \ that comparing existing Medicaid SUD program standards side-by-side with the\
      \ \nspecific provider and service recommendations for each level of care described\
      \ in the ASAM \nCriteria is a useful step that states can take to ensure that\
      \ care is delivered consistent with industry \nstandard criteria. This exercise\
      \ may be especially valuable for clinically intensive services such as \nresidential\
      \ treatment. Appendix Two includes a template that can be used to compare existing\
      \ state \nprotocols for SUD providers with the provider competencies recommended\
      \ in the ASAM Criteria \nfor Adult Level 3.1 services. \nMany states have incorporated\
      \ residential treatment into the SUD care continuum in a way that is \ndesigned\
      \ to improve care quality while monitoring excessive use and expenditures. These\
      \ states \nhave articulated SUD provider and program standards to reflect with\
      \ fidelity the ASAM Criteria \nrecommendations for Adult Level 3 services. The\
      \ examples below highlight select state mandates, \nlicensure standards, program\
      \ guidance, and managed care administration designs that specify SUD \ntreatment,\
      \ facility and provider requirements in line with the industry standard. \n\
      State Regulations and Licensure Standards \nCalifornia received approval for\
      \ a section 1115 demonstration to pilot test a new program for the \norganized\
      \ delivery of services to treat SUDs. California’s program, called the Drug\
      \ Medi- Cal \nOrganized Delivery System (DMC-ODS) aims to simultaneously increase\
      \ access to SUD services, \nincluding residential treatment and withdrawal management,\
      \ while decreasing programmatic costs \nto Medicaid. The DMC-ODS aims to provide\
      \ Medicaid beneficiaries with the continuum of care \nmodeled after the ASAM\
      \ Criteria for SUD services. \nCalifornia has taken several steps efforts to\
      \ ensure that providers and treatment facilities \nparticipating in the DMC-ODS\
      \ pilot are delivering care in accord with the ASAM criteria, \nincluding implementing\
      \ strategies to assess short-term residential treatment providers as delivering\
      \ \ncare consistent with the ASAM Level 3.1, 3.3 and 3.5 levels of care. Providers\
      \ operating at each \nlevel of care are required to achieve specific licensure\
      \ or alcohol and other drug (AOD) \ncertification.  Provider applications for\
      \ new licenses and certifications must show that the \nprovider’s staffing plans,\
      \ use of training to ensure evaluations, services, and referrals are conducted"

      \ of Health Care Services also \nconducts onsite evaluations of residential\
      \ programs to ensure that they are appropriately staffed and \nhave the necessary\
      \ services in place to be certified as Level 3.5 programs.11 12 \nThe Maine\
      \ Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations for licensing and\
      \ \ncertifying substance abuse treatment programs in 2008. These mandates clearly\
      \ adopt the ASAM \nlevel-of-care requirements for residential services including\
      \ residential withdrawal management. \nProvider credentials also are clearly\
      \ stated in accordance with ASAM Criteria.13  \nProgram Standards \nSeveral\
      \ states have developed and issued guidance to support SUD treatment programs\
      \ to provider \ncare in accordance with key benchmarks from the ASAM Criteria.\
      \ For example, in 2013 Michigan \nreleased a treatment policy formally establishing\
      \ requirements for residential services to be in line \nwith those set forth\
      \ by the ASAM Criteria.14 The document outlines specific provider, service and\
      \ \nstaffing requirements in accordance with key benchmarks from the ASAM Criteria\
      \ descriptions for \nLevel 3 programs, and carefully directs providers through\
      \ the dimensions of care and gradations of \nintensity for residential services.\
      \ \nSeveral states have developed crosswalks between their locally developed\
      \ patient placement \ncriteria and the ASAM criteria to guide the use of residential\
      \ services. For example, the Arizona \nDepartment of Health Services has developed\
      \ a practice protocol to help Tribal and Regional \nBehavioral Health Authorities\
      \ and providers better understand and implement the ASAM \nCriteria.18 This\
      \ protocol highlights criteria that would make beneficiaries eligible for continued\
      \ \nstay, transfer, or discharge from residential treatment. \nConclusion \n\
      We hope this document is valuable to states interested in introducing SUD benefit\
      \ design, program \nand administrative reforms, as it provides general information\
      \ about key benchmarks from \nnationally developed SUD treatment guidelines.\
      \ The information and resources included in this \ndocument can also serve as\
      \ a helpful reference for states that are developing a comprehensive \nbenefits\
      \ package covering the full continuum of care, and incorporating industry-standard\
      \ \nbenchmarks for defining medical necessity criteria, covered services and\
      \ provider qualifications. \n                                              \

      \ about how some of the decisions \nregarding your available treatment or service\
      \ options \nmay have been made. It can help you understand \nhow The ASAM Criteria\
      \ is used in treatment, and \nhow professionals such as physicians, providers,\
      \ and \nfunders of care rely on it to determine what services \nwill best match\
      \ a patient’s individual needs. It is not \na clinical document and cannot be\
      \ used to diagnose \nor identify care. The information provided in this \ndocument\
      \ is intended to help you become an active \nparticipant in your own care, but\
      \ should not be \nconsidered medical advice, nor is it comprehensive \nor definitive.\
      \ For more information, consult a skilled, \ntrained professional in substance\
      \ use, mental health \nand/or other addictive disorders who uses The ASAM \n\
      Criteria in their work.\n“The least intensive, but safe, level \nof care...”\n\
      A “level of care” can refer to the intensity \nof treatment you might receive,\
      \ such as \nthe difference between a walk-in clinic \nand a 24-hour hospital\
      \ stay. It is the \ngoal of treatment providers to make sure \nthe care you\
      \ receive keeps you safe, and \naddresses all risks, but also that the care\
      \ \nis as “least intensive,” as possible, which \nhelps you avoid unnecessary\
      \ or wasteful \ntreatment.\nAn Introduction to The ASAM Criteria \nfor Patients\
      \ and Families\nWhat is The ASAM Criteria?\nThe ASAM Criteria is a collection\
      \ of objective guidelines that give clinicians a way to standardize treatment\
      \ \nplanning and where patients are placed in treatment, as well as how to provide\
      \ continuing, integrated care and \nongoing service planning. The criteria were\
      \ developed by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), \nand presented\
      \ in a book written by a group of renowned doctors and professionals, working\
      \ in a variety of \nmental health and addiction treatment fields. The ASAM Criteria\
      \ has \nbecome the most widely used set of criteria in the United States for\
      \ \nthe treatment of substance-use issues, and it has been continually \nrevised\
      \ and updated over the years with the newest science in the field \nof addiction.\
      \ Currently in its third edition (2013), The ASAM Criteria \nhas been in use\
      \ since 1991, and its foundations extend back even \nfurther into history.\n\
      Treatment professionals use a lot of information to decide how to best \nprovide\
      \ care to their patients. They rely on clinical knowledge, their \nexperience\
      \ in the field, and, perhaps most importantly, the direction \nand goals developed\
      \ collaboratively with the patient him or herself. \nMany professionals use\
      \ The ASAM Criteria to assist them in filtering \nall of this knowledge and\
      \ data, and in determining what kind of \nservices can be provided to the patient\
      \ at the least intensive, but safe, \nlevel of care.\nOne important aspect of\
      \ The ASAM Criteria is that it views patients in their \nentirety, rather than\
      \ a single medical or psychological condition. This means \nthat, when determining\
      \ service and care recommendations, The ASAM Criteria \npays attention to the\
      \ whole patient, including all of his or her life areas, as \nwell as all risks,\
      \ needs, strengths, and goals.\nKeep in mind that The ASAM Criteria is an educational\
      \ tool. It does \nnot dictate a particular standard of care or specific treatment\
      \ decisions. \nTreatment professionals are responsible for the care of their\
      \ patients and \nmust make independent judgments about whether and how to use\
      \ The \nASAM Criteria in their treatment decisions."

      \ consent of ASAM.\nConsider the whole person. Rather than basing treatment\
      \ decisions around a single element or \ndiagnosis from your life, The ASAM\
      \ Criteria takes a “multidimensional” approach, meaning it \nrecognizes the\
      \ many different areas of life that make up who you are, and how these life\
      \ areas, or \n“dimensions,” contain different risks and needs, as well as strengths\
      \ and resources. A patient’s risks, \nneeds, strengths and resources provide\
      \ the basis for creating a treatment plan.\nDesign treatment for the specific\
      \ patient. The ASAM Criteria recognizes that effective treatment \ncannot take\
      \ a one-size-fits-all approach. Every individual’s treatment plan is based on\
      \ his or her \nunique needs, and therefore may be different, or require a variety\
      \ of types or intensities of care.\nIndividualize treatment times. Some programs\
      \ use the same treatment timeline for all of their \npatients (such as putting\
      \ everyone in a “28-day program”). The ASAM Criteria views treatment \nlength\
      \ as a unique factor—one that depends on the individual’s progress and changing\
      \ needs.\n“Failure” is not a treatment prerequisite. Some providers look at\
      \ a patient’s history to see if he or \nshe has first “failed” out of less-intense\
      \ services before approving a more intense type of care (such \nas a residential\
      \ program or hospital stay). The ASAM Criteria does not see “failures” from\
      \ treatment \nas an appropriate way to approve the correct level of care. \n\
      Provide a spectrum of services. Although five broad levels of service are described\
      \ in The ASAM \nCriteria, these levels represent benchmarks along a single continuum\
      \ of care. These levels are linked \nto one another, and patients can move among\
      \ and between them based on their current needs.\nReconceptualize the definition\
      \ of “addiction.” In 2011, ASAM proposed a definition of \n“addiction” designed\
      \ to be consistent with both clinical wisdom and the latest research discoveries.\
      \ \nTo read more, visit the following link: http://www.asam.org/for-the-public/definition-of-addiction.\n\
      Guiding Principles of The ASAM Criteria\nThere are many principles that guided\
      \ the development of The ASAM Criteria. Some of these principles can \nbetter\
      \ explain the mindset of your physician or care provider, and help you understand\
      \ how these criteria are \nused in determining the best treatment services for\
      \ you.\nAt first, I couldn’t understand why I was being sent to a residential\
      \ center to address my alcohol \nuse. I mean, it wasn’t like I was drinking\
      \ a bottle a day. I had thought the treatment decision \nwould only be based\
      \ on the average number of drinks I had: the more drinks per night, the \ngreater\
      \ the risk.\nTurns out, the amount I was drinking was only part of the story.\
      \ My doctor pointed \nout that some of my other health problems were not only\
      \ quite \nserious, but actually related to my drinking. She saw other \npatterns\
      \ I hadn’t noticed, too: the stress from work that sent me to \nthe bar, the\
      \ repeated promises to quit, even some physical signs of \nwithdrawal.\nWhen\
      \ my doctor made her treatment recommendation, she was \nlooking at the “whole\
      \ me,” not just the amount of alcohol that \nwas going in.\n\n[Page 3]\n© 2015\

      \ to Make \nDecisions About Care\nThe ASAM Criteria provides treatment \nprofessionals\
      \ with objective standards they \ncan use to help identify the least intensive\
      \ \ntreatment services that can help keep a \nparticipant safe as he or she\
      \ works to make \npersonal life changes. But identifying the \nmost appropriate\
      \ services is just one step in \na much more intricate process. The ASAM \n\
      Criteria actually outlines a detailed flowchart \nthat treatment providers and\
      \ professionals \ncan use to assist them in their clinical \ndecisions.\nThis\
      \ “decisional flowchart” has been \nprovided here, and each of its three main\
      \ \ncomponents (Assessing, Identifying, and \nProviding/Evaluating) is discussed\
      \ on the \nfollowing pages.\nThese are steps providers and professionals \n\
      work through together when discussing \nwhat type of care to offer—and fund—for\
      \ \nan individual. Following this decisional \nflow helps ensure that treatment\
      \ is being \neffectively managed, and that patients receive \nthe appropriate\

      \                otherwise reproduced in any form without the prior written\
      \ consent of ASAM.\n“Assessing” with The ASAM Criteria\nThe “assessment” phase\
      \ of treatment represents the \nearly information-gathering phase, in which\
      \ patient \nand physician work together to determine what signs \nand symptoms\
      \ are present, and what they point to. \nThe ASAM Criteria begins this phase\
      \ by asking “What \ndoes the patient want?” and “Why now?” If there isn’t \n\
      good agreement and understanding on these early \nquestions, it can significantly\
      \ impact the later stages \nof treatment.\nThe ASAM Criteria is also unique\
      \ in how it guides \ntreatment professionals to conduct assessments. \nRather\
      \ than simply focusing on a diagnosis, or an \nisolated symptom, The ASAM Criteria\
      \ uses what’s \ncalled a “multidimensional” assessment. This \nassessment is\
      \ a way to see how treatment might affect \nmultiple life areas of an individual.\n\
      There are six major life areas (or “dimensions”) \ndetailed in The ASAM Criteria,\
      \ and each one \ninfluences the others. Your treatment providers look \nat these\
      \ dimensions from \nevery angle, considering \nthem separately and \ntogether,\
      \ and exploring \nboth risks and strengths \nin each.\nPhysicians use their\
      \ \nclinical knowledge to \ngather information about \nthese dimensions, and\
      \ \ncombine this with any \nother diagnoses (such as a \nsubstance use disorder)\
      \ to \ncomplete the “Assessing” \nphase. (Some levels of care \nrequire that\
      \ a patient have a specific diagnosis in order \nto be admitted. The ASAM Criteria\
      \ specifies that a \nprofessional can use a reference tool such as the DSM-\n\
      5 or ICD-10 in order to help determine a diagnosis.)\n3\n1\n6\n2\n5\n4\nASSESSING\n\
      Dimension 1:  Acute Intoxication \nand/or Withdrawal Potential\nThis life area\
      \ explores your past and \ncurrent experiences of substance use \nand withdrawal.\n\
      Dimension 2: Biomedical \nConditions/Complications\nIn this life area, think\
      \ about your \nphysical health, medical problems \nand physical activity and\
      \ nutrition.\nDimension 3: Emotional/Behavioral/\nCognitive Conditions and Complications\n\
      This life area helps explore your \nthoughts, emotions and mental health \n\
      issues.\nDimension 4: Readiness to Change\nThis life area identifies what you\
      \ are \nmotivated for and your readiness and \ninterest in changing.\nDimension\
      \ 5: Relapse/Continued Use/\nContinued Problem Potential\nThis life area addresses\
      \ concerns you \nmight have about your continued \nsubstance use, mental health\
      \ or a relapse.\nDimension 6: Recovery \nEnvironment\nThis life area explores\
      \ your living \nsituation and the people, places and \nthings that are important\
      \ to you.\nHere are the six dimensions of The ASAM Criteria, with a brief description\
      \ of each one. Think of \neach dimension like the side of a cube, showing something\
      \ different about who you are, and an \nessential part to what makes you, you.\n\

      \                otherwise reproduced in any form without the prior written\
      \ consent of ASAM.\n“Identifying” with The ASAM Criteria\nOnce the information\
      \ about a patient’s wants, immediate needs, and different life \nareas have\
      \ been gathered, treatment professionals move into the second phase of \nthe\
      \ decision-making process. This phase helps them identify what issues are of\
      \ the \nhighest severity, and of the highest priority, to address in treatment.\n\
      Treatment professionals rely on their clinical knowledge and training to help\
      \ \ndetermine which issues and which life areas pose the biggest challenges.\
      \ The \nASAM Criteria helps them rank these areas and choose which ones to target\
      \ \nduring treatment. From here, professionals and providers can work with the\
      \ \npatient to figure out the specific services needed, and what goals to set.\
      \ No \nservices are recommended that do not refer back to the patient’s needs\
      \ and goals.\nPATIENT\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nIDENTIFYING\nEach life area can carry\
      \ its own level of risk, but these life \nareas also interact with each other.\
      \ The ASAM Criteria helps \nrate and rank these risks, and determine which ones\
      \ will \nbe the most important to focus on within treatment.\nI don’t have a\
      \ lot of support people in my life, and my living situation isn’t very healthy\
      \ right now, so \nI can understand being at a high risk in that particular area.\
      \ What I didn’t notice is that my personal \nmotivation and my physical health\
      \ are the strongest they’ve ever been. And those strengths can actually \nlower\
      \ my overall risk.\nSo it turns out my treatment plan includes a lot of goals\
      \ about finding a better place to live—one that \nsupports the other healthy\
      \ areas of my life. The type of care I receive is determined by my risks, but\

      \ consent of ASAM.\n“Providing/Evaluating” with The ASAM Criteria\nThe final\
      \ phase of The ASAM Criteria treatment process takes the assessment \ninformation,\
      \ and the identified priorities and services, and establishes what \nintensity\
      \ of services should be provided. In other words, this is where service \nproviders\
      \ and patients decide how much (and how often) treatment is needed. \nPatients\
      \ may require weekly, daily, or even hourly services (which might require \n\
      a residential program or hospital stay). Again, this intensity is determined\
      \ by \na patient’s unique, individual needs, and provided in the least intensive,\
      \ but \nsafe treatment setting. Once this has been done, the final step is to\
      \ track the \nprogress of treatment, including any recommendations for discharge,\
      \ transfer, or \ncontinuing service\nWhen to Discharge from Treatment\nWhen\
      \ the patient has fulfilled the goals of the treatment services and no other\
      \ \nservice is necessary.\nWhen to Transfer\nThere are many reasons a patient\
      \ may be transferred to a different type of service. \nTwo common ones are...\n\
      1.\t The patient is not able to achieve the goals of their treatment, but could\
      \ achieve \ntheir goals with a different type of treatment.\n2.\t The patient\
      \ has achieved their original treatment goals, but they have developed \nnew\
      \ treatment challenges that can be achieved in a different type of treatment.\n\
      When to Continue Service\nWhen the patient is making progress toward their goals,\
      \ and it is reasonable to \nbelieve they will continue making progress with\
      \ their existing treatment, it is \nappropriate to continue service.\nDischarge,\
      \ Transfer, and Continuing Service\nAll decisions about when to end services,\
      \ when to change services, and when \nto continue services are based on the\
      \ progress the patient is making. The ASAM \nCriteria does not support any treatment\
      \ that has dates of “graduation” or \n“completion” that can be assigned before\
      \ treatment has even begun. The length of \ntreatment depends upon the progress\
      \ made, in clearly defined and agreed-upon \ngoals, rather than a result of\
      \ a program’s preset structure.\nPROVIDING/\nEVALUATING\nThe following pages\
      \ include a condensed description of different “levels of care” a patient might\
      \ be \nprovided (such as an “outpatient clinic” or a “24-hour care” environment).\
      \ These pages also include more \ndetailed charts that illustrate a small part\
      \ of the decision-making that providers and professionals can use \nto help\
      \ them determine an appropriate level of care (including how the severity of\
      \ different dimensions \ncan point to different levels of care)."

      \ of treatment is often split into “levels” of care, these levels connect to\
      \ each other, acting \nmore like “benchmarks” along a single spectrum. Patients\
      \ can move between levels, depending on their unique \nneeds. ASAM also uses\
      \ separate criteria and levels of care benchmarks for adult patients and adolescent\
      \ patients. \nThis is because adolescents can be in different stages of emotional,\
      \ mental, physical, and social development than \nadults. For this reason, certain\
      \ adolescent services, such as withdrawal management, are bundled together with\
      \ \nthe rest of their treatment, whereas adults are able to enter into withdrawal\
      \ management treatment separately.\nLevel of Withdrawal Management for Adults\n\

      \ Health Integration Services\nThe medical community now widely considers \n\
      integrating behavioral health care with primary care, \nknown as behavioral\
      \ health integration or BHI, an \neffective strategy for improving outcomes\
      \ for millions \nof Americans with mental or behavioral health \nconditions.\n\
      What is BHI?\nBHI is a type of care management service. In recent years, we\
      \ expanded care management codes to describe \nservices that involve:  \n\t\n\

      New for CY 2025\nTo make behavioral health care more accessible, we added new\

      \ These updates focus on helping patients at risk of suicide and improving \n\
      follow-up care after a crisis.\nSafety Planning & Crisis Care Updates\nWe encourage\
      \ providers to use safety planning for patients at risk of suicide. To support\
      \ this effort, we \nintroduced new billing codes:\n\t\n●G0560 – Safety planning\
      \ interventions for patients with suicidal ideation or overdose risk\n•\t Billed\
      \ in 20-minute increments when the billing practitioner performs the service\n\

      \ follow-up after emergency department discharge\n•\t Covers up to 4 follow-up\
      \ calls per month as part of bundled crisis care services\nTip: We make separate\

      BHI Services Using the Psychiatric Collaborative Care Model \nSince 2017, we’ve\
      \ made separate payments to physicians and non-physician practitioners supplying\
      \ BHI \nservices using the Psychiatric Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) approach\
      \ to patients during a calendar \nmonth. In 2018, we established payment for\
      \ general BHI services using models other than CoCM and began \nmaking payment\
      \ for these services using CPT codes:\n\t\n●99492\n\t\n●99493\n\t\n●99494\n\
      HCPCS Code G2214: Refining Coding for CoCM Services\nWe added the BHI service\
      \ in the CY 2021 MPFS Final Rule (CMS-1734-F) and began payment on January 1,\
      \ \n2021, for:\n\t\n●Initial or subsequent psychiatric collaborative care management\n\
      \t\n●First 30 minutes of behavioral health care manager activities in a month\n\
      \t\n●Services in consultation with a psychiatric consultant and directed by\
      \ the treating physician or other \nqualified health care professional\nAn example\
      \ of when to use this code is when you see a patient for services, then hospitalize\
      \ them or refer \nthem for specialized care, and you don’t meet the number of\
      \ minutes needed to bill using the current coding.\nHCPCS Code G0323: Care Management\
      \ Services for Behavioral Health Conditions\n\t\n●Introduced in CY 2023 to describe\
      \ general BHI that a clinical psychologist (CP) or clinical social worker \n\
      (CSW) performs \n\t\n●Accounts for monthly care integration, with the CP or\
      \ CSW serving as the focal point for mental health \nservices \n\t\n●Requires\
      \ at least 20 minutes of CP or CSW time per calendar month\nTip: Psychiatric\
      \ diagnostic evaluation, CPT code 90791, serves as the initiating visit for\
      \ G0323.\nCPT only copyright 2024 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\n\

      \ Members\nPractitioners use BHI codes to bill and get paid for services using\
      \ models of care with well-defined roles and \nrelationships among care team\
      \ members. The following roles and relationships describe all BHI services \n\
      unless noted:\nIncident To\nWe consider BHI services delivered by other members\
      \ of the care team, under the direction of the billing \npractitioner, incident\
      \ to the billing practitioner’s services. These services are subject to the\
      \ state law, licensure, \nand scope of practice that applies to their practice\
      \ specialty. The billing practitioner either employs or contracts \nwith the\

      Initiating Visit\nWe require an initiating visit for new patients or patients\
      \ not seen within 1 year before the start of BHI services. \nThis visit establishes\

      Supervision\nWe assign BHI services that the billing practitioner doesn’t personally\
      \ perform as general supervision under the \nMedicare Physician Fee Schedule\
      \ (MPFS). General supervision alone doesn’t create a qualifying relationship\
      \ \nbetween the billing practitioner and other care team members. We define\
      \ general supervision as the service \ndelivered under the overall direction\
      \ and control of the billing practitioner, and that doesn’t require their physical\
      \ \npresence during provision of services.\nAdvance Consent\nBefore starting\
      \ BHI services, the patient must give the billing practitioner permission to\
      \ consult with relevant \nspecialists, which includes talking with a psychiatric\
      \ consultant. The billing practitioner must inform the patient \nthat cost sharing\
      \ applies for both face-to-face and non-face-to-face services even if supplemental\
      \ insurers \ncover cost sharing. \nWe don’t require written consent. \n\t\n\
      ●You may get verbal consent from the patient\n\t\n●You must document it in the\
      \ medical record\nTip: MPFS payment is available whether the patient spends\
      \ part or all of the month in a facility stay or \ninstitutional setting. Report\
      \ the place of service (POS) where the billing practitioner would normally \n\
      deliver face-to-face care to the patient. Medicare can make separate Part B\
      \ payment to hospitals, \nincluding critical access hospitals, when the billing\
      \ practitioner reports a hospital outpatient POS."

      ---\n\n[Page 1]\n1\nFACT SHEET\nMedicaid Documentation for \nBehavioral Health\
      \ Practitioners\nBehavioral Health Medical Records\nBehavioral health practitioners\
      \ are in the business of helping their patients. Patients are their priority.\
      \ Meeting \nongoing patient needs, such as furnishing and coordinating necessary\
      \ services, is impossible without documenting \neach patient encounter completely,\
      \ accurately, and in a timely manner. Documentation is often the communication\
      \ \ntool used by and between professionals. Records not properly documented\
      \ with all relevant and important facts can \nprevent the next practitioner\
      \ from furnishing sufficient services. The outcome can cause unintended complications.\
      \ \nAnother reason for documenting medical services is to comply with Federal[1]\
      \ and State laws.[2] These laws \nrequire practitioners to maintain the records\
      \ necessary to “fully disclose the extent of the services,” care, and \nsupplies\
      \ furnished to beneficiaries,[3] as well as support claims billed. In addition,\
      \ proper documentation can \nhelp protect a behavioral health practitioner from\
      \ challenges to furnished treatment, and civil, criminal, and \nadministrative\
      \ penalties and litigation.\nGeneral Behavioral Health Medical Record Documentation\
      \ Requirements\nBehavioral Health services must meet specific requirements for\
      \ reimbursement. Documented services must:\n•\t Meet that State’s Medicaid program\
      \ rules;\n•\t To the extent required under State law, reflect medical necessity\
      \ and justify the treatment and clinical \nrationale (remember, each State adopts\
      \ its own medical necessity definition);[4]\n•\t To the extent required under\
      \ State law, reflect active treatment;\n•\t Be complete, concise, and accurate,\
      \ including the face-to-face time spent with the patient (for example, the \n\
      time spent to complete a psychosocial assessment, a treatment plan, or a discharge\
      \ plan);\n•\t Be legible, signed, and dated;\n•\t Be maintained[5] and available\
      \ for review; and\n•\t Be coded correctly for billing purposes.\nThere are some\
      \ things to avoid as a behavioral health practitioner. Never bill “chance, momentary\
      \ social encounters \nbetween a therapist and a patient” as valid therapeutic\
      \ sessions;[6] never bill undocumented services; and never \nbill services coded\
      \ at a higher level than those furnished. For example, if furnishing group therapy,\
      \ be sure and \nbill group therapy codes rather than individual therapy codes,\
      \ and document patient-specific information in each \nattendee’s medical record.\n\
      Prevent Problems—Self-Audit\nBehavioral health practitioners have specific responsibilities\
      \ when they accept reimbursement from a government \nprogram. They “have a duty\
      \ to ensure that the claims submitted to Federal health care programs are true\
      \ and \naccurate,”[7] and that their medical record documentation supports and\
      \ justifies billed services. All practitioners’ \ndocumentation is open to scrutiny\
      \ by many, including employers, Federal and State reviewers, and auditors.[8,\
      \ 9] \nPractitioners can protect themselves and their practices by implementing\
      \ an internal self-auditing strategy."

      **Source:** Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\n**Document Pages:** 4\
      \ total\n\n---\n\n[Page 2]\n2\nThere are five basic self-audit rules behavioral\
      \ health practitioners can use to get started:\n1.\t Develop and implement a\
      \ solid medical record documentation policy if there is not one in place, even\
      \ if you \nare a practitioner in a solo practice. If there is one in place,\
      \ make sure the policy covers meeting Federal and \nState Medicaid regulations.\
      \ The policy should address what actually happens in everyday practice. \n2.\t\
      \ Develop or use one of the available standard medical audit tools. The tool\
      \ should cover the documentation \npolicy criteria and coding standards as part\
      \ of the review. \n3.\t Choose a staff member who understands documentation\
      \ and coding principles to select a random sample of \nrecords for a specific\
      \ time period. Decide how many records should be reviewed, and then pull every\
      \ “nth” \nchart for that time period. If you are a practitioner in a solo practice,\
      \ you may want to ask a like practitioner \nto review the charts.\n4.\t Resist\
      \ being the one to choose and audit your own charts. Most practitioners can\
      \ read their own writing \nand understand the meaning of records they wrote\
      \ even if the documentation is not actually in the record. \nRemoving bias is\
      \ important. For best results, make the audit as realistic as possible. \n5.\t\
      \ Use the self-audit results for improving practice compliance. There is no\
      \ real value in conducting a \nself-audit unless discovered issues are resolved.\
      \ Review and analyze the audit findings. Identify the \ncommon documentation,\
      \ coding and billing problems, and solve the problems found. Then educate staff\
      \ \nmembers and hold them accountable for making changes. After implementing\
      \ any corrective action, audit \nthe process again to ensure improved compliance\
      \ and successful implementation.\nElectronic health records (EHRs) require similar\
      \ methods, but the unique nature of EHRs requires extra precautions.\n1.\t Make\
      \ sure auto-fill and keyword features are turned off. Watch for “cloned” notes—notes\
      \ that appear \nidentical for different visits; these may not reflect the uniqueness\
      \ of the encounter or the patient’s description \nof their chief complaint.\n\
      2.\t Make sure all notes have a date and time stamp, even when updating patient\
      \ history and life events. \nSeparate notes entered at different times by paragraph\
      \ returns or other clear punctuation or spacing.\n3.\t Make sure any edits to\
      \ the patient’s record are also initialed or identified with the person making\
      \ the edit.\nFraud, Waste, and Abuse\nProperly filed claims are the responsibility\
      \ of all behavioral health practitioners. Practitioners can be culpable if \n\
      they knowingly participate in fraudulent activities or know of illegal activity\
      \ and do nothing.[10] Health care laws \ncarry heavy penalties for offenders.\
      \ Penalties can be administrative, civil, and criminal.[11, 12]\nReport Fraud,\
      \ Waste, and Abuse\nIf you are aware of or suspect fraud, waste, or abuse, report\

      As the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health \nand Substance Use in the U.S.\
      \ Department of \nHealth and Human Services and the leader of the \nSubstance\
      \ Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA), I am pleased to\
      \ present \nthis publication, the 2025 National Guidelines \nfor a Behavioral\
      \ Health Coordinated System of \nCrisis Care (2025 National Crisis Guidelines).\n\
      The transition in July of 2022 from the National \nSuicide Prevention Lifeline\
      \ to the 988 Suicide \n& Crisis Lifeline (988 Lifeline) was a monumental \n\
      achievement created through bipartisan support \nof the National Suicide Hotline\
      \ Designation Act \nof 2020. The 988 Lifeline provides an easy to \nremember\
      \ three-digit number to access trained \nsupport for those in mental health,\
      \ suicidal, or \nsubstance use crisis or experiencing any form of \nemotional\
      \ distress. Since its launch in July 2022, \nthe 988 Lifeline has received more\
      \ than 12 million \ncalls, texts, and chats. This large volume of calls, \n\
      texts, and chats continues to emphasize the need \nfor and support for crisis\
      \ services.\nWith rapid expansion of crisis services around the \ncountry as\
      \ catalyzed by the 988 Lifeline, SAMHSA \nidentified the need for ongoing guidance\
      \ for states, \ntribes, territories, and other local partners to create \nand\
      \ maintain an effective crisis continuum of \nservices, particularly focused\
      \ on using a systems-\nbased approach that can provide the needed \noversight,\
      \ integration, and sustainability to care for \npeople throughout and after\
      \ a crisis episode. As a \nresult, SAMHSA pulled together a team of experts\
      \ \nto support the revision of and enhancement to \nthe National Guidelines\
      \ for Behavioral Health \nCrisis Care: Best Practice Toolkit (PDF) (2020). \n\
      The original publication in 2020 has been heavily \nreviewed and used as guide\
      \ for the development of \ncrisis care nationwide as the first document \nof\
      \ its kind that provided a national vision for \ncrisis services. In 2025, in\
      \ light of the rapidly \nexpanding field and landscape of crisis care after\
      \ \nthe launch of 988, SAMHSA with the assistance \nof a vast array of partners,\
      \ has produced a new \npublication to provide revised guidance.\nThe 2025 National\
      \ Crisis Guidelines builds from \nthe work of the original guidelines, as well\
      \ as from \nresearch, new and innovative approaches, and \nemerging best practices.\
      \ Along with its companion \ndocument, the Model Definitions for Behavioral \n\
      Health Emergency, Crisis, and Crisis-Related \nServices, these new publications\
      \ are a result of \nthe dedication, collaboration, and work that this \nteam\
      \ has done to provide guidance and highlight \neffective practices for crisis\
      \ care services across \nthe country. SAMHSA has identified the essential \n\
      elements for an effective crisis continuum such that \neveryone in the nation\
      \ has a robust system that \nmeets their needs, one that includes “someone to\
      \ \ncontact, someone to respond, and a safe place for \nhelp.” This evolution\
      \ highlights the various models \nand strategies that communities have been\
      \ using \nto effectively implement services and programs to \nsupport the specific\
      \ needs of their populations.\nThe 2025 National Crisis Guidelines exemplifies\
      \ \nthe work that goes into upholding SAMHSA’s vision \nthat people with, affected by, or at risk of mental \n\
      health and substance use conditions receive care, \nachieve well-being, and\
      \ thrive. We hope that this \nguidance will aid communities in their development\
      \ \nand enhancement of the crisis services continuum \nfor their citizens to\
      \ ensure everyone has access to \ncare that meets their needs.\nMiriam E. Delphin-Rittmon,\

      \ Summary\nThe 2025 National Guidelines for a Behavioral \nHealth Coordinated\
      \ System of Crisis Care \n(2025 National Crisis Guidelines) establishes \na\
      \ framework to transform behavioral health \ncrisis care systems and reduce\
      \ the impact of \nsubstance use and mental illness on communities \nthroughout\
      \ the United States. Spearheaded by \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health\
      \ Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA), these guidelines aim \nto provide equitable,\
      \ accessible, and effective \nresponses to behavioral health crises, and support\
      \ \nprogram design, development, implementation, \nand continuous quality improvement\
      \ for behavioral \nhealth crisis care throughout the nation.\nThis update is\
      \ spurred by the country’s transition \nto the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\
      \ (988 Lifeline), \nas well as recent progress and emerging needs \nin the field\
      \ related to behavioral health crisis \nsystem transformation. The 2025 National\
      \ Crisis \nGuidelines will accomplish three goals: \n1. Establish overarching\
      \ principles for behavioral \nhealth crisis system transformation; \n2. Clarify\
      \ the various elements that comprise the \ncontinuum; and \n3. Offer guidance\
      \ to support the systematic \ncoordination of these elements to create and \n\
      sustain behavioral health crisis systems.\nOverarching Principles\nThe 2025\
      \ National Crisis Guidelines emphasize the \nfollowing principles:\nA. Crisis\
      \ Services Should Be Comprehensive, \nIntegrated, Coordinated, and Developed\
      \ \nUtilizing a Systems-Based Approach\nB. Crisis Services Should Be Person-Centered,\
      \ \nFamily-Focused, and Provide the Right Level \nof Care at the Right Time\n\
      C. Crisis Services Should Prioritize Safety\nD. Crisis Services Should Be Equitably\
      \ Accessible \nand Responsive to the Diverse Needs \nof Populations  \nE. Crisis\
      \ Services Should Prioritize Quality \nand Effectiveness\nF. Crisis Services\
      \ Should Be \nDevelopmentally Appropriate\nG. Crisis Services Should Be Resiliency-\
      \ and \nRecovery-Oriented\nH. Crisis Services Should Be Trauma-Informed\nI.\
      \ Crisis Services Should Provide Continuity \nof Care from Onset of Crisis Until\
      \ Stability \nand Include Follow-Up Care and Linkage\nJ. Crisis Services Should\
      \ Be Evidence-Based, \nEvidence-Informed, and/or Reflect Best, \nPromising,\
      \ and Emerging Practices\nK. Crisis Services Should Be Responsive \nto Individuals’\
      \ Wholistic Needs\nEssential Elements\nThe 2025 National Crisis Guidelines are\
      \ built upon \nthree foundational elements that are essential \nwithin an integrated\
      \ crisis care system:\n1. Someone to Contact: Services like the 988 \nLifeline\
      \ and other behavioral health hotlines \nprovide immediate, accessible support.\n\
      2. Someone to Respond: Services like mobile \ncrisis teams deliver rapid, on-site\
      \ interventions \nto de-escalate crises and connect individuals to \n2\nNATIONAL\
      \ GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral Health Coordinated System of Crisis Care\n2\n\
      \n[Page 7]\ncare and other community-based supports that \nprovide crisis prevention\
      \ and postvention care.\n3. A Safe Place for Help: Emergency and crisis \nstabilization\
      \ services that support on-demand \ncrisis care and crisis-related supports\
      \ in a \nvariety of community settings.\nSAMHSA envisions that these collective\
      \ elements \nintegrate to establish a seamless system of \nsystems that can\
      \ serve “anyone, anywhere, at \nanytime”1 in order to provide a local Behavioral\
      \ \nHealth Coordinated System of Crisis Care \n(BHCSCC) that offers high quality\
      \ behavioral \nhealth care for individuals at all levels of acuity that \ncan\
      \ support wellness, promote safety, and avoid \nunnecessary care in both healthcare\
      \ and law-\nenforcement institutional settings.\nStrategic Impact and \nFuture\
      \ Directions\nA BHCSCC strives to improve outcomes for \nindividuals and families\
      \ while reducing reliance \non emergency departments and law enforcement \n\
      for the care of those with urgent or emergent \nbehavioral health needs. By\
      \ providing person-\ncentered care that emphasizes not only treating \nthe crisis,\
      \ the goal of the BHCSCC is to foster \nresilience and long-term recovery, reduce\
      \ suicide \nand overdose rates, and strengthen communities.\nThis 2025 update\
      \ reflects the landscape in the \ncontext of the transition to the 988 Lifeline\
      \ and \nintroduces expanded recommendations for \nservice delivery, system equity,\
      \ and technological \nintegration. These guidelines lay the foundation \nfor\
      \ a system that ensures no individual faces \na behavioral health crisis without\
      \ access to \nappropriate support and resources. It is a call to \naction for\
      \ federal, state, tribal, and local partners \nto collaborate in building sustainable\
      \ crisis \ncare systems.\n3\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral Health Coordinated\

      The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 \n(P.L. 117-103) provided $5 million\
      \ to establish a \n988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (988 Lifeline) and \nBehavioral\
      \ Health Crisis Coordinating Office \n(BHCCO) within the Substance Abuse and\
      \ Mental \nHealth Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Office \nof the Assistant\
      \ Secretary for Mental Health and \nSubstance Use. This legislation also established\
      \ \nSAMHSA as the lead federal behavioral health \ncrisis services entity.\n\
      The establishment of 988 represents a once-in-a-\nlifetime opportunity to strengthen\
      \ the 988 Lifeline \nand transform the behavioral health crisis care \nsystem\
      \ in the United States. The overarching goal \nof the transformation is to save\
      \ lives by serving \n“anyone, anywhere, at any time”2 and in a manner \nthat\
      \ minimizes law enforcement involvement and \npromotes linkages to ongoing local\
      \ supports. This \ngoal is aligned with a comprehensive national \nstrategy\
      \ and related investments to address \nthe country’s mental health crisis, as\
      \ well as \nSAMHSA’s Strategic Plan: 2023–2026 (PDF), the \nGuidance for Emergency\
      \ Responses to People \nwith Behavioral Health or Other Disabilities (2023)\
      \ \n(PDF) issued by the U.S. Departments of Justice \n(DOJ) and Health and Human\
      \ Services (HHS),3 \nas well as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices’\
      \ (CMS) work on expanding coverage for \ncrisis care such as through their specific\
      \ work on \nmobile crisis services.\nThese initiatives are focused on protecting\
      \ and \nstrengthening equitable access to high-quality \nand affordable care,\
      \ as well as improving social \nwell-being, equity, and economic resilience.\
      \ \nSAMHSA actively continues its work to advance \nthis agenda by strengthening\
      \ system capacity, \nconnecting more people to care, and creating a \ncontinuum\
      \ of wholistic and equitable behavioral \nhealth supports designed to transform\
      \ our health \nand social services infrastructure. Similarly, states, \nlocal\
      \ governments, tribes and tribal organizations, \njurisdictions, and territories\
      \ also have done a \nsignificant degree of work to develop their crisis \nsystems\
      \ over the past several decades. The \ntransition of the National Suicide Prevention\
      \ \nLifeline to the 988 Lifeline has accelerated further \nadvancement to these\
      \ efforts.\nRecent data regarding suicide and drug overdose \ndeaths, and gaps\
      \ in receiving behavioral health \nservices4 underscore the need for a coordinated\
      \ \nsystem of crisis care that is integrated within the \nlarger behavioral\
      \ health system of care.5 Children \nand adults who do not receive needed behavioral\
      \ \nhealth crisis services are at risk for experiencing \nunnecessary and/or\
      \ multiple hospital readmissions, \nincarceration, homelessness, overdose, early\
      \ \ndeath, and suicide.6 Families and youth may \nbecome unnecessarily involved\
      \ in the child welfare \nsystem and/or juvenile justice system, which \nseparates\
      \ youth from their family and caregiver \nsupports.\nCommunities that already\
      \ face disparities in \naccess to services and resources may be further \nmarginalized\
      \ through primary law enforcement \nresponse to behavioral health crisis and\
      \ extended \nstays in emergency departments (EDs). Crisis \nresponders may refer\
      \ individuals in crisis to \npsychiatric inpatient services when they may \n\
      have better outcomes in less restrictive and \nmore inclusive community-based\
      \ services. \nFinally, the current approach to crisis care in \nmany communities\
      \ involves delivering a range of \ndisparate services that are not coordinated\
      \ within \na larger system of care. This results in fragmented \n4\nNATIONAL\

      \ crises, saves lives, enables \nfamilies to remain together, provides person-\n\
      centered and recovery-oriented care at the optimal \nlevel for the individual,\
      \ addresses structural \ninequities, and uses high-intensity, expensive \nresources\
      \ only when necessary. A BHCSCC is \naligned with the compass of the quintuple\
      \ aim to \noptimize health systems, including enhancing the \nexperience of\
      \ the help seeker and family, using \nresources effectively and efficiently,\
      \ improving \noverall community and population health, \nadvancing health equity,\
      \ and improving the well-\nbeing, morale, and job satisfaction of behavioral\
      \ \nhealth crisis workers.7\nIn its pursuit of an effective, coordinated, and\
      \ \nintegrated behavioral health crisis system, \nSAMHSA is dedicated to two\
      \ key goals: \n1. Strengthen and expand the 988 Lifeline and \n2. Transform\
      \ the behavioral health crisis response \nsystem in the United States. \nSAMHSA\
      \ is actively working to achieve these goals \nand is guided by a vision of\
      \ a comprehensive, \nintegrated, equitable, and trauma-informed \nBHCSCC that\
      \ includes “someone to contact, \nsomeone to respond, and a safe place for help”\
      \ \nfor “anyone, anywhere, at anytime.”8 This vision of \ncoordinated crisis\
      \ services, a system of systems, \nis inclusive and longitudinal—it meets the\
      \ needs of \nall and recognizes that people need support over \ntime, not only\
      \ in discrete crisis events.\nMovement toward the vision of a comprehensive,\
      \ \nintegrated, equitable, and trauma-informed system \nshould start with the\
      \ experience of the person \nseeking care. It must also address the capabilities\
      \ \nof the system in responding to individual needs as \ndefined by the help\
      \ seeker. The establishment of \nan emergency-capable system for public safety\
      \ \nand acute medical concerns is an important \nreference point. When people\
      \ need assistance \nfor a public safety or emergency physical health \ncondition,\
      \ the triad of 911 Public Safety Answering \nPoints (PSAPs), emergency service\
      \ dispatches, \nand ED transfers to a location that is equipped \nto care for\
      \ the condition is widely available \nregardless of the ability to pay, admissions\
      \ criteria, \nor clearance protocols. As with public safety and \nemergency\
      \ physical health situations, behavioral \nhealth emergency response capability\
      \ should be \npresent to help ensure access to services for all \nand parity\
      \ within the BHCSCC.\nIn 2020 and 2022, SAMHSA published the \nNational Guidelines\
      \ for Behavioral Health Crisis \nCare: Best Practice Toolkit (PDF) (2020) and\
      \ the \nNational Guidelines for Child and Youth Behavioral \nHealth Crisis Care\
      \ (PDF) (2022), respectively, to \narticulate the need for more comprehensive\
      \ and \nintegrated crisis system design practices. In these \ndocuments, SAMHSA\
      \ identified three essential \nelements of a behavioral health crisis system:\
      \ crisis \ncall lines, mobile crisis response, and emergency \nand crisis stabilization\
      \ services.\nThis 2025 update, the 2025 National Guidelines \nfor a Behavioral\
      \ Health Coordinated System of \nCrisis Care (2025 National Crisis Guidelines),\
      \ \nis spurred by the country’s transition to the 988 \nLifeline, as well as\
      \ recent progress and emerging \nneeds in the field related to behavioral health\
      \ crisis \nsystem transformation. The 2025 National Crisis \nGuidelines will\

      \ Role of Crisis Services \nwithin the Broader Behavioral \nHealth Ecosystem\n\
      As a crucial component of the broader behavioral \nhealth ecosystem, a comprehensive\
      \ behavioral \nhealth crisis system is responsive at any time and \nany place\
      \ for anyone. A crisis response system \nshould have the capacity to prevent,\
      \ recognize, \nrespond to, de-escalate, and follow up on crises \nacross a continuum,\
      \ from crisis planning to early \nstages of support and from crisis stabilization\
      \ and \nintervention to post-crisis follow-up and support for \nthe individual\
      \ and their family and other supporters. \nGiven the multi-system involvement\
      \ of many \nindividuals with behavioral health issues, the crisis \ncare system\
      \ approach provides the infrastructure \nto improve care coordination and outcomes\
      \ \nand better invest resources across the systems \nthat serve individuals\
      \ experiencing behavioral \nhealth crisis.\nA behavioral health crisis system\
      \ represents a \nkey set of services that includes “someone to \ncontact, someone\
      \ to respond, and a safe place for \nhelp.” This includes crisis contact centers,\
      \ mobile \ncrisis teams (MCTs) and outreach services, and \ncrisis stabilization\
      \ services that work together \nto coordinate care. These services address the\
      \ \nacute behavioral health needs of people in crisis; \nare consistent with\
      \ goals to improve well-being; \ndecrease psychological distress/substance use\
      \ \nand prevent suicide and overdose; and are linked \nto sub-acute and outpatient\
      \ services that support \nongoing engagement harm reduction, treatment, \nand\
      \ supports that foster recovery and resilience.\nIndividuals with lived experience\
      \ with mental health \nand/or substance use crisis have reported difficulty\
      \ \naccessing responsive and timely care. People can \nbecome lost in a system\
      \ that is not coordinated \nand does not follow up consistently with help \n\
      seekers. Under-resourced and marginalized \npopulations, such as those from\
      \ racial, ethnic, \nsexual orientation, and other minority groups, as \nwell\
      \ as individuals with co-occurring intellectual \nand developmental disabilities\
      \ and/or from rural \ncommunities, often face additional burdens with \nrespect\
      \ to access and outcomes.\nRequired services cut across these care \nelements.\
      \ It is essential to ensure that systems \nare coordinated and integrated to\
      \ meet the needs \nof people with mental health and substance use \nconcerns.\
      \ Services should be trauma-informed, \nculturally and linguistically relevant\
      \ across the \ndevelopmental lifespan, and include linkages \nto services that\
      \ address social drivers of health \n(SDOH) and health-related social needs.\
      \ SDOH \nrefer to conditions in the environments where \npeople are born, live,\
      \ learn, work, play, worship, \nand age that affect a wide range of health,\
      \ \nfunctioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.9 \nIt also is important\
      \ to remember that many people \ncontinue to receive behavioral health services\
      \ and \nsupports outside of the behavioral health system \nas strictly defined—this\
      \ includes primary care \nproviders, faith-based supports, and traditional \n\
      healers, among others. Such partners should \nbe engaged in coordination efforts\

      \ Principles \nfor a BHCSCC\nIn pursuit of the strategic goals to strengthen\
      \ and \nexpand the 988 Lifeline and transform the nation’s \nbehavioral health\
      \ crisis care system, SAMHSA \nhas identified the following overarching principles\
      \ \nthat should guide the long-term development of \na BHCSCC. Use of the term\
      \ crisis services in \nthese principles is intended to apply broadly to all\
      \ \ncategories of services articulated in the subsequent \nsections. This foundation\
      \ ensures that individuals \nand communities have appropriate access and \n\
      support to engage in the behavioral health crisis \nservices. The principles\
      \ of the BHCSCC have \nbeen developed using important concepts from two \nexisting\
      \ frameworks, Recovery-Oriented Systems \nof Care10 and Children’s Systems of\
      \ Care,11 which \nare individual- and family-centered and focus on \ncommunity\
      \ coordination to improve outcomes \nfor individuals, families, and communities.\
      \ These \nprinciples are also found in the Model Definitions \nfor Behavioral\
      \ Health Emergency, Crisis, and \nCrisis-Related Services. These principles\
      \ here \nfocus not only on how the services should be \nimplemented, but on\
      \ how they should be integrated \ninto a systems-based approach to develop a\
      \ \nBHCSCC.\nA. Crisis Services Should Be Comprehensive, Integrated, \nCoordinated,\
      \ and Developed Utilizing a Systems-\nBased Approach\nKey principle: Multi-system\
      \ collaboration. \nBehavioral health crisis services should be \ndelivered through\
      \ a BHCSCC that acknowledges \nthe need for multiple systems (i.e., a system\
      \ of \nsystems) to collaborate and support the individual \nseeking services\
      \ and their family and significant \nothers. The BHCSCC should include strong\
      \ cross-\nsector partnerships between the public sector, \nprivate sector, and\
      \ key non-profit entities. Critical \npartners include the network of 988 Lifeline\
      \ crisis \ncontact centers, MCTs, crisis services providers, \nother behavioral\
      \ health providers, providers \naddressing SDOH, state and local governments,\
      \ \ntribal nations and organizations, public health \nagencies, Medicaid agencies\
      \ and other payers, \nnational mental health and suicide prevention \nprovider\
      \ and consumer groups, faith-based entities, \nand multiple sectors with an\
      \ interest in seeing a \ntransformed behavioral health crisis care system, \n\
      including first responders, law enforcement, \nemergency medical professionals,\
      \ and 911 PSAPs, \namong others.\nKey principle: Clear oversight structures\
      \ to \nensure integration and coordination. Clear \noversight structures are\
      \ needed for the BHCSCC \nto drive system implementation and ensure that \n\
      individuals can move throughout the system \nand participate in different services\
      \ without \nexperiencing gaps in care (i.e., to ensure seamless \nsupport and\
      \ flow for the help seeker across \nvarious system components). Clinical and\
      \ medical \nleadership are a key part of the needed oversight \nstructure to\
      \ address clinical quality and to ensure \nservices are meeting the needs of\
      \ all help seekers, \n11\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral Health Coordinated\

      \ including the provision of \nservices that prevent crisis situations.\nSystems\
      \ that should be part of a BHCSCC \ninclude, but are not limited to, healthcare\
      \ settings, \nincluding EDs; schools; social service and child \nwelfare agencies;\
      \ domestic violence, sexual \nassault, and human trafficking programs; housing\
      \ \nproviders; public safety-first responders; and \nadult and juvenile justice\
      \ systems, among others. \nA community’s crisis system is embedded within \n\
      a behavioral health continuum; it is not meant to \nreplace a robust behavioral\
      \ health system that \nincludes services for people with a wide array \nof needs.\
      \ Crisis services should be linked to the \nbroader continuum of health and\
      \ behavioral health \nservices and social supports, including, but not \nlimited\
      \ to Certified Community Behavioral Health \nClinics (CCBHCs), community mental\
      \ health \ncenters, behavioral health homes, and Federally \nQualified Health\
      \ Centers (FQHCs). Crisis services \nproviders should engage family, unpaid\
      \ caregivers, \nand/or other supporters at all stages of crisis \ncare, as able\
      \ and appropriate. This engagement \ncan provide valuable support during the\
      \ acute \nstabilization phase of the crisis and facilitate \nengagement with\
      \ follow-up care to prevent \nfuture crises through fostering a connection with\
      \ \nthe community.\nServices must also be properly tailored to meet the \nindividualized\
      \ needs of a community. For example, \nit is not enough to have a wide array\
      \ of different \ncrisis services. Services must have the capacity \nto serve\
      \ the population size and density of the \ncommunity in order to provide effective\
      \ on-demand \ncare and garner community trust as an entity that \nis truly accessible\
      \ and effective in a time of crisis. \nCrisis systems must utilize data to continuously\
      \ \nmonitor the relevant process and outcome \nmeasures of the component crisis\
      \ services to \nensure that the services are not only providing \naccessible,\
      \ quality, and equitable care, but that \nthe component services are interconnected\
      \ into a \nsystem that does the same.\nSUBSTANCE USE AND SUBSTANCE USE \nDISORDERS:\
      \ Services within the crisis system \nshould be able to address all the behavioral\
      \ health \nneeds of an individual in crisis. Just as crisis \nworkers must know\
      \ the full range of mental health \nconditions, they much also know how to assess\
      \ \nand intervene with the full range of substance \nuse and know how to provide\
      \ an appropriately \nmatched integrated response to people with any \ncombination\
      \ of mental health and substance use \ncrisis, based on the client’s level of\
      \ risk as well as \ntheir needs and preferences. Throughout the crisis \nsystem,\
      \ services should be co-occurring capable \nand designed to meet the needs of\
      \ individuals \nwho present with SUDs as well as mental health \nconditions.\
      \ This means that services should serve \nall individuals, families, and other\
      \ supporters in a \nbehavioral health crisis regardless of diagnosis or \nlack\
      \ of diagnosis.\nCrisis staff should be trained to recognize and \nassess substance\
      \ use and SUDs. Providers \nshould not exclude individuals regardless of \n\
      substance-related or co-occurring needs at time \nof service if it is safe to\
      \ engage them (e.g., not \nactively experiencing a life-threatening overdose\
      \ \nor intoxication leading to high-risk behaviors that \nare unable to be safely\
      \ de-escalated). Providers \nshould have established policies and protocols\
      \ for \nserving individuals experiencing substance use \nintoxication and/or\
      \ withdrawal and protocols for \nscreening, brief interventions, harm reduction,\
      \ and \nreferrals to higher levels of care in circumstances \n12\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\n\

      \ the need of the individual exceeds \nprovider capabilities.\nAll crisis services\
      \ providers and staff are likely to \nencounter individuals with co-occurring\
      \ needs and \ntherefore should be trained and supervised based \non their role,\
      \ responsibilities, and level of training. \nThis includes competency in how\
      \ to engage, \nscreen, and manage the needs of individuals who \nmay be experiencing\
      \ co-occurring mental health \nand substance use needs.\nB. Crisis Services\
      \ Should Be Person-Centered, Family-\nFocused, and Provide the Right Level of\
      \ Care at the \nRight Time\nCrisis services should be strength-based, person-\n\
      centered, resilience- and recovery-oriented, and \nresponsive to those in need.\
      \ When able, family \nmembers, caregivers, and other supporters may \nact as\
      \ partners, in resolving the acute crisis, \nstabilizing, and safely supporting\
      \ the individual \nwithin any crisis service setting. The coordinated \ncrisis\
      \ services that SAMHSA envisions allow \npeople and their families, caregivers,\
      \ and other \nsupporters (when appropriate) to determine what \nis a crisis\
      \ and when services are needed to the \ngreatest extent possible. As with the\
      \ use of 911 \nand EDs, the help seekers themselves can define \nthe crisis.\
      \ This is fundamental when designing, \nbuilding, and/or enhancing the crisis\
      \ continuum in \na community. Individuals, families, and caregivers \nand other\
      \ supporters can define what is a crisis. \nTherefore, a system should have\
      \ services to \naddress all levels of crisis need.\nCommunities should have\
      \ an array of crisis \nservices at different levels of care, including \nemergency\
      \ access for people who have the \nhighest acuity of need and services in less\
      \ \nrestrictive and more inclusive environments for \nthose with less acute\
      \ needs. In order to prevent \nunnecessary ED visits, hospitalization, and \n\
      engagement with the criminal justice system, the \navailability of care for\
      \ those with the highest acuity \nof needs is essential to successfully deflect\
      \ and \ndivert individuals. Crisis services should develop \nclear plans for\
      \ continuity of operations to ensure \nthat care is provided in case of natural\
      \ and other \ndisasters so that these services are consistently \navailable\
      \ in the community. Community partners \nshould ensure timely access to services\
      \ and strive \nfor short wait times and high response rates for \nservices.\
      \ To further support person-centered care, \nservices across the continuum should\
      \ recognize \npeer support practices designed to be delivered by \npeers. Please\
      \ see SAMHSA’s National Consumer \nand Consumer Supporter Technical Assistance\
      \ \nCenters for more resources.\nIt is imperative for a community’s behavioral\
      \ health \ncrisis services continuum to have the capacity \nto assess individuals\
      \ in crisis and to ensure that \nthey receive the appropriate level of care\
      \ at the \nappropriate time to serve their needs, improve \ntheir mental health\
      \ and substance use-related \nsymptoms, address SDOH, and help mitigate \ncurrent\
      \ and future crises. Collaboration among \nall partners in the service continuum\
      \ is critical, \nincluding 988 contact centers; MCTs; crisis \nstabilization\
      \ settings; hospitals/EDs; residential \nprograms; peer services; 911 PSAPs\
      \ and \npublic safety-first responders; and others. While \nSAMHSA’s goal is\
      \ to be able to link specific crisis \nservices to the American Society of Addiction\

      \ to continued partnership on this effort.\nCollaboration should exist at both\
      \ the system level \nand the individual person and family/caregiver \nlevel.\
      \ Many people experiencing a mental health, \nsubstance use, or co-occurring\
      \ crisis will have \ncontact with multiple systems and providers. \nCrisis systems\
      \ should be embedded within larger \nbehavioral health continuums and include\
      \ strong \ncollaboration and coordination across crisis system \npartners. Equally,\
      \ the crisis service continuum \nshould be coordinated across its own service\
      \ array, \nallowing for seamless connection between the \nthree essential elements\
      \ of the crisis care system: \nSomeone to Contact, Someone to Respond, and \n\
      A Safe Place for Help. People in crisis and their \nsupports require “no wrong\
      \ door” entry into the \ncrisis system with quick connections to the right \n\
      service, at the right time, in the right location.\nServices across the crisis\
      \ continuum should \nalso be transparent about policies impacting \ndata and\
      \ privacy, as well as policies with respect \nto initiation of non-consensual\
      \ interventions, \nand have established policies for the receipt \nand response\
      \ to grievances. Policies should \nemphasize at all levels the importance and\
      \ limits \nof confidentiality and privacy in accordance with \nthe Health Insurance\
      \ Portability and Accountability \nAct, Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder\
      \ \nPatient Records (42 CFR Part 2), and any \napplicable state requirements.\
      \ This includes \naddressing data-sharing practices among family \nmembers,\
      \ caregivers, and providers, particularly \nin the context of follow-up and\
      \ care coordination. \nIt also considers the role of anosognosia, more \ncommonly\
      \ known as the lack of insight into one’s \nown symptoms, on the delivery of\
      \ services in areas \nsuch as informed consent as well as its impact on \nfamily,\
      \ caregivers, and other supporters.\nC. Crisis Services Should Prioritize Safety\n\
      Although many crisis events do not involve life-\nthreatening situations, crisis\
      \ settings often provide \ncare for people who are experiencing them and \n\
      should be able to assess and mitigate those risks \naccordingly. Safety, for\
      \ individuals experiencing \na crisis, those providing the services, and the\
      \ \ncommunity as a whole is a foundational element \nfor all crisis service\
      \ settings. The focus of safety \nis on making sure help seekers and staff are\
      \ \nneither physically nor emotionally hurt, through a \nwelcoming, sensitive\
      \ culture and responsiveness \nand with a no force first culture and mitigation\
      \ \nof risks of iatrogenic harm. Capacity to screen, \nassess, and respond to\
      \ the varied needs of people \nin crisis, including those with suicidal and/or\

      \ complications and/\nor substance-related overdose, at risk of harm \nin a\
      \ situation of interpersonal violence (IPV), or \nimpacted by natural disasters,\
      \ is a key to crisis \nsystem design. Services and systems should be \ndesigned\
      \ in a way that people have a sense of \nboth physical and emotional safety.\
      \ Furthermore, \nservices should be operated in a physical setting \n(when applicable)\

      \ \npromising practices including suicide attempt \nsurvivor support groups.\
      \ Providers of crisis \nservices should also have adequate training and \ncapacity\
      \ specifically geared toward responding to \nthose who may be experiencing psychosis\

      \ approaches to screening and \nservice support to people impacted by IPV.\n\
      Conducting a suicide and/or violence screening \nand risk assessment and developing\
      \ a crisis or \nsuicide safety plan are vital for promoting both the \nimmediate\
      \ safety and long-term stability of people \nseeking behavioral health crisis\
      \ care. CMS in its \nCalendar Year (CY) 2025 Medicare Physician Fee \nSchedule\
      \ final rule describes the basic components \nof safety planning interventions.13\
      \ Safety planning \ninterventions involve the development of a \npersonalized\
      \ list of coping and response strategies \nand sources of support that the person\
      \ can use \nin the event of experiencing thoughts of harm to \nthemselves or\
      \ others.\nThe safety plan development process should be \ncollaborative with\
      \ the care-seeking person and \nthe provider and should focus on their strengths\
      \ \nand goals. SAMHSA describes safety planning \nin detail in Treatment for\
      \ Suicidal Ideation, Self-\nHarm, and Suicide Attempts Among Youth (PDF). \n\
      This resource details the need for a safety plan \nthat is brief, clear, and\
      \ person-centered. Safety \nplanning can be done with any qualified crisis or\
      \ \nhealth professional and should be made universally \navailable to all individuals\
      \ at high risk of or \nexperiencing a behavioral health crisis.\nOverdose prevention\
      \ is also critical. SAMHSA \nhas released the Overdose Prevention and \nResponse\
      \ Toolkit which provides guidance about \nhow to prevent and respond to overdoses.\
      \ Crisis \nsystems should be developed with the evolving \nunderstanding and\
      \ responsivity to the culture of \nsubstance use in their service catchment\
      \ area \nincluding overdose trends. They should also be \naware of harm reduction\
      \ principles and activities, \nand consider any relevant laws governing harm\
      \ \nreduction activities, such as naloxone distribution.\nThe National Action\
      \ Alliance for Suicide Prevention \nfacilitated the development of evidence-based\
      \ \nactions known as Zero Suicide or Suicide Safer \nCare that healthcare organizations\
      \ can apply \nthrough an implementation toolkit developed by the \nSuicide Prevention\
      \ Resource Center (SPRC).14 \nThe following seven key elements of Zero Suicide\
      \ \nor Suicide Safer Care are applicable to crisis care:\n • Creating a leadership-driven,\
      \ safety-oriented \nculture committed to dramatically reducing \nsuicide among\
      \ people under care, that includes \nsurvivors of suicide attempts and suicide\
      \ loss in \nleadership and planning roles;\n • Training providers in evidence-based\
      \ and \nculturally informed clinical practices;\n • Systematically identifying\
      \ and assessing \nsuicide risk among people receiving care;\n • Ensuring every\
      \ individual has a pathway \nto care that is both timely and adequate to \n\
      meet their needs and includes collaborative \nsafety planning and a reduction\
      \ in access to \nlethal means;\n • Using effective, evidence-based treatments\
      \ that \ndirectly target suicidal thoughts and behaviors;\n • Providing continuous\
      \ contact and support, \nespecially after acute care; and\n • Applying a data-driven\
      \ quality improvement \napproach to inform system changes that will \nlead to\
      \ improved patient outcomes and better \ncare for those at risk.15\n15\nNATIONAL\

      \ Crisis Guidelines\n**Document Pages:** 104 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 20]\nThe\
      \ elements of Zero Suicide closely mirror the \nstandards and guidelines of\
      \ the 988 Lifeline, \nwhich has established suicide risk screening and \nassessment\
      \ standards, guidelines for help seekers \nat imminent risk, and protocols for\
      \ follow-up \ncontact after the crisis encounter. Zero Suicide \nalso promotes\
      \ collaborative safety planning, \nreducing access to lethal means, and incorporating\
      \ \nthe feedback of suicide loss and suicide attempt \nsurvivors into the service\
      \ provided. This framework \ncan also be used for overdose prevention.\nFinally,\
      \ although individuals with behavioral health \nconditions are more likely to\
      \ be a victim of crime \nthan a perpetrator, crisis services need to be aware\
      \ \nof how to assess for the risk of both aggression or \nviolence and risk\
      \ of victimization of an individual \nwho has a behavioral health condition(s).\n\
      D. Crisis Services Should Be Equitably Accessible and\nResponsive to the Diverse\
      \ Needs of Populations\nCMS defines health equity as “the attainment of \nthe\
      \ highest level of health for all people, where \neveryone has a fair and just\
      \ opportunity to attain \ntheir optimal health regardless of race, ethnicity,\
      \ \ndisability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic \nstatus, geography, preferred\
      \ language, or other \nfactors that affect access to care and health \noutcomes.”16\
      \ SAMHSA defines behavioral health \nequity as the right to access high-quality\
      \ and \naffordable healthcare services and supports for all \npopulations, including\
      \ Black, Latino, and American \nIndian, Alaska Native and Indigenous persons,\
      \ \nAsian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific \nIslanders and other persons\
      \ of color; members of \nreligious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual persons;\
      \ \npersons with disabilities; persons who live in rural \nareas; and persons\
      \ otherwise adversely affected \nby persistent poverty or inequality.\nIn pursuit\
      \ of equity, it is necessary to acknowledge \nthat access to behavioral health\
      \ crisis care services \ncan vary significantly for different populations. \n\
      All crisis services should optimize accessibility and \nsupport underserved\
      \ populations (e.g., LGB youth \nand adults, people who live in rural areas,\
      \ people \nwith disabilities, unhoused individuals, older adults, \nAmerican\
      \ Indian, Alaska Native, and Indigenous \ncommunities, and other racial and\
      \ ethnic minority \ngroups). HHS recently published an Agency Equity \nAction\
      \ Plan to address the behavioral health \nissues that disproportionately impact\
      \ underserved \npopulations.17\nCrisis services should be designed to facilitate\
      \ \naccess and utilization, working towards elimination \nof inequities in care.\
      \ Crisis services should be \nculturally relevant and linguistically appropriate,\
      \ \nwith agencies, programs, and services that \nreflect the cultural, racial,\
      \ ethnic, and linguistic \ndifferences of the populations they serve. Services\
      \ \nshould be welcoming and accessible to all people \nexperiencing behavioral\
      \ health crises, maximizing \nsimplified assessment, recommendations, and \n\
      open access.\nServices should be equitably available to all \npopulations and\
      \ not discriminate based on race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, language\
      \ spoken, \nancestry, immigration status, housing status, \ninsurance status,\
      \ age, sexual orientation, height, \nweight, marital status, or physical, mental,\
      \ or \nintellectual or developmental disability. Programs \nshould not refuse\
      \ to serve an individual based on \nforensic engagement, or other factors. Behavioral\
      \ \nhealth crisis services and system performance data \nshould be disaggregated\
      \ to identify and address \nimpact disparities.\n16\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor\

      \ to measure quality. Data and \nevaluation plans should have a clear process\
      \ for \ndisaggregating information by age, race, ethnicity, \ngeography, and\
      \ sexual orientation variables, \namong other demographic metrics, including\
      \ \ntracking the number of instances that trigger law \nenforcement and child\
      \ welfare involvement.\nSatisfaction with care should be a prioritized \noutcome.\
      \ People having positive experiences \nof care, where they feel supported, respected,\
      \ \nengaged, and prepared for next steps, help \nbuild trust and likelihood\
      \ of using the services \nagain when needed. Satisfaction with services, \n\
      improvements in level of distress, and linkages \nto follow-up care are examples\
      \ of care that can \npositively impact the quality, effectiveness, and \nsafety\
      \ of care.\nSentinel events such as a death by suicide should \nalso be reviewed\
      \ in a systematic manner to \nidentify how to prevent further adverse outcomes.\
      \ \nPrograms should also document notification of \nrights and any outcomes\
      \ from complaints and \ngrievances investigations for periodic review and \n\
      performance improvement; programs should also \ncollect data, as applicable,\
      \ on seclusion, restraint, \nand involuntary interventions.\nOngoing evaluation\
      \ and cycles of planning, \nexecuting, studying, and adjusting are crucial \n\
      for quality crisis work. Crisis services need to \nidentify key performance\
      \ indicators to track and \nmake necessary adjustments to improve crisis \n\
      care. Frameworks such as the Plan-Do-Study-\nAct Worksheet, Directions, and\
      \ Examples19 can \nhelp to ensure that the goals and objectives of \na crisis\

      \ Services Should Be Developmentally Appropriate\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH: This category\
      \ refers \nto children, youth, and young adults of transition \nage who are\
      \ still involved in youth-serving \nsystems. Crisis services for children, youth,\
      \ and \ntheir families, caregivers, and supporters should \nespecially utilize\
      \ an approach that minimizes \nscreening-out or triage of referrals, while prioritizing\
      \ \na rapid face-to-face, developmentally appropriate \nassessment as much as\
      \ possible. Crisis staff \nshould be trained in the unique needs of and best\
      \ \npractices for working effectively with children, \nyouth, families, caregivers,\
      \ and supporters in \ncrisis. Crisis staff should recognize that the \nparent,\
      \ caregiver, or sibling(s) who are present \nare experiencing a traumatic event\
      \ and should \nbe trained in best practices for working effectively \nwith other\
      \ people who are significant to the child \nor youth. Finally, crisis staff\
      \ need to recognize that \nany removal from the home is often traumatic for\
      \ \nchildren and their families. EDs, inpatient, and \nother crisis-bedded facilities\
      \ are typically a last \nresort, with an emphasis on maintaining the child \n\
      safely at home by engaging the family, caregivers, \nand others’ supports in\
      \ a strong crisis safety plan.\nCrisis staff should have knowledge of community\
      \ \nand home-based resources for children, youth, and \nfamilies. Crisis services\
      \ should have relationships \nwith agencies and systems serving children \n\
      and youth (e.g., schools, family medicine and \npediatric providers, juvenile\
      \ justice, child welfare, \nyouth and family peer services). Protocols should\
      \ \nbe in place that guide care coordination and \nservice referrals to these\
      \ agencies and systems. \nWhen forming protocols, systems should make \nevery\
      \ effort to prevent the unnecessary and \ninappropriate involvement of the child\
      \ welfare \nsystem. A whole family approach is needed when \nworking with children,\
      \ youth, and their families. \nMobile Response & Stabilization Services National\
      \ \nBest Practices (PDF)21 is an example of a best \npractice crisis system\
      \ model for serving children, \nyouth, and their families and caregivers.\n\
      OLDER ADULTS: Crisis services should be \naccessible for older adults aged 55\
      \ years or older. \nCrisis staff should be trained in the unique needs \nof\
      \ and best practices for working effectively with \nolder adults and conditions\
      \ such as dementia, \neven if a specialized service that serves older \nadults\
      \ exists in their organization, as well as \nwith older adults experiencing\

      \ and working effectively with family \nmembers and caregivers and have knowledge\
      \ of \ncommunity and home-based resources specific to \nolder adults. Loneliness,\
      \ social isolation, and lack \nof access to treatment providers are contributing\
      \ \nfactors for older adults experiencing a behavioral \nhealth crisis. Crisis\
      \ services should have \nrelationships with agencies and systems serving \n\
      older adults (e.g., agencies on aging, primary care, \ncommunity-based home\

      \ Services Should Be Resiliency- and \nRecovery-Oriented\nProviders and crisis\
      \ staff should recognize that \na crisis is self-defined by the help seeker\
      \ and all \ninterventions should include a strengths-based \ndiscovery to identify\
      \ important skills, strengths, \nresources, and positive behaviors that are\
      \ \nhelpful in adapting and overcoming adverse \nexperiences and promoting wellness.\
      \ The crisis \nintervention should be guided by the specific, \nindividualized\
      \ recovery goals in SAMHSA’s \nrecovery domains of “health, home, purpose, and\
      \ \ncommunity” in a respectful and strengths-based \nmanner. Individual and\
      \ parent/guardian/caregiver \nautonomy (for minors or others who are unable\
      \ to \nconsent to medical care) should be prioritized and \nmaintained as much\
      \ as possible. This includes \nensuring access to the most appropriate level\
      \ of \ncare needed based on the crisis.\nPeer support and recovery support services\
      \ can \nbe an integral way to help ensure services are \nresiliency- and recovery-oriented.\
      \ Peer support \nproviders bring their own lived experiences and \ncan apply\
      \ their own personal knowledge to the \nbehavioral health challenges of living\
      \ a life of \nrecovery and resilience. Peer support providers \ncan provide\
      \ support for help seekers, being an \nexample of hope and providing real examples\
      \ \nof the power of recovery and resilience. Peer \nsupport services should\
      \ be embedded in the crisis \ncontinuum. These services should be provided in\
      \ \na manner that is guided by SAMHSA’s Working \nDefinition of Recovery (PDF),\
      \ including that \npeer services are voluntary and chosen by the \nindividual.22\
      \ Peer support also should be aligned \nwith roles and recommendations as outlined\
      \ in \nSAMHSA’s Peer Support Services in Crisis Care \n(PDF), which includes\
      \ a focus on scope of practice \nand mitigating against a drift away from this\
      \ scope \nof practice.\nFor children and youth, there should be a focus \non\
      \ resilience and returning the child/youth and \ntheir families and caregivers\
      \ to routine activities \nincluding at home, school, and recreation. Crisis\
      \ \nstaff should assist the child/youth and family \nmembers to identify their\
      \ strengths and goals, \nencourage communication with family/caregivers \nand\
      \ other trusted adults, and build hope for a \npositive resolution.\nH. Crisis\
      \ Services Should Be Trauma-Informed\nThe impact of traumatic events on behavioral\
      \ \nhealth crisis is significant: from the ongoing \neffects of adverse childhood\
      \ experiences and \nrecent victimization to the added impact of \ncommunity\
      \ or historical traumatization. For \nall those experiencing a crisis, but especially\
      \ \nchildren, youth, and young adults, difficult or \nchallenging behaviors\
      \ should be seen through \nthe lens of “what has happened or is happening \n\
      to” rather than “what is wrong with” the individual. \nPeople may experience\
      \ trauma associated with \nbehavioral health systems, including the use of \n\
      restraint or seclusion, or witnessing its use and \neffects on others. These\
      \ experiences may induce \nresistance to seek help for future behavioral \n\
      health crisis situations. Trauma-informed services \nrecognize these potential\
      \ traumas and prioritize \nproviding the most integrated care with dignity to\
      \ \nthe individual. As noted, services should collect \ndata on use of involuntary\

      \ \n(PDF) and the use of evidence-based or evidence-\ninformed approaches that\
      \ are appropriate for the \ncrisis care context and the person. Crisis care\

      \ care provided.\nPlease see SAMHSA’s Practical Guide for \nImplementing a Trauma-Informed\
      \ Approach for \nadditional information and guidance.\nI. Crisis Services Should\
      \ Provide Continuity of Care from \nOnset of Crisis Until Stability and Include\
      \ Follow-Up \nCare and Linkage\nEmergency and crisis interventions should focus\
      \ \non both alleviating the current crisis and lowering \nthe risk of future\
      \ episodes. Behavioral health crisis \nsystems should implement a “no wrong\
      \ door” \napproach where individuals are able to access \ncrisis services regardless\
      \ of how or where they \ninitially seek help. If an individual seeks crisis\
      \ \ncare from a facility or program that does not \nprovide crisis services,\
      \ collecting and providing \ninformation about their needs to entities that\
      \ have \nthe responsibility and authority to do so (e.g., crisis \nstabilization,\
      \ MCTs, IPV supports, other behavioral \nhealth programs, foster care, school\
      \ systems) is an \nimportant component of a behavioral health crisis \nsystem\
      \ of care.\nCrisis services should provide continuity of care, \nongoing care\
      \ coordination, and a continuum of \nservices from onset of crisis until return\
      \ to stability. \nWhile a single crisis service may be sufficient to \nstabilize\
      \ a person’s situation, it is often the case \nthat someone will need multiple\
      \ services in the \ncrisis continuum, as well as services like Partial \nHospitalization\
      \ and Intensive Outpatient Programs, \nbefore their experience is stabilized\
      \ enough to \nreturn to routine care. Receipt of one crisis service \nshould\
      \ be a facilitator for access to any of the \nbehavioral health services that\
      \ can address the \nhelp seeker’s symptoms and/or distress.\nPeople who are\
      \ experiencing a crisis need to have \ncontinued support and resources after\
      \ the initial \nacute crisis event. These follow-up services should \nbe planned\
      \ for and occur at every point on the \ncrisis continuum and essentially serve\
      \ as the fourth \nessential element of the crisis continuum. Although \nthis\
      \ is more challenging when services do not \nrequire disclosure of identity,\
      \ every effort should be \nmade to engage the individual and family/caregiver\
      \ \nto provide follow-up care and appropriate resource \nlinkages as appropriate.\
      \ All people with current \nsuicidal ideation or otherwise at risk of suicide\
      \ \nshould be offered follow-up services. Following up \nwith someone after\
      \ receiving crisis services has \nshown to aid in reductions in suicidal behaviors\
      \ \nand reduces the likelihood that they will need \ncrisis services again.23\

      \ and community context \nin which they are delivered. Providers should \nengage\
      \ in programmatic evaluation and quality \nimprovement activities to assess\
      \ and improve \neffectiveness. Evaluations of specific services and \ninterventions\
      \ should include a clear description of \nthe service and key components, a\
      \ logic model, \nprocess and outcomes measures, a description \nof data collection\
      \ and analysis methods, results, \nand recommendations.\nK. Crisis Services\
      \ Should Be Responsive to Individuals’ \nWholistic Needs\nCrisis services providers\

      \ what constitutes effective care for diverse \npopulations, including Service\
      \ Members, Veterans \nand their families, minoritized communities, \npeople\
      \ impacted by geographic isolation, and LGB \npopulations. Crisis services providers\

      \ should \nnot exclude individuals with physical disabilities \n(e.g., ambulatory,\
      \ vision, hearing), but should have \nan understanding of reasonable accommodation\
      \ \nrequests and offer supportive adaptations, \ntranslation, and supports.\
      \ Providers should have \nestablished protocols for guiding coordination and\
      \ \nreferrals to medical providers. Crisis staff should \nbe trained to work\
      \ in collaboration with medical \nproviders and have knowledge of community\
      \ and \nhome-based resources for individuals with co-\noccurring medical conditions.\n\
      INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL \nDISABILITIES (I/DD), BRAIN INJURY, AND \nNEUROCOGNITIVE\
      \ DISORDERS: Services \nshould be accessible to individuals with I/DD. Crisis\
      \ \nstaff should be trained to recognize individuals \nwith I/DD, neurodiverse\
      \ needs, brain injury, and \ndementia and the best practices for working \n\
      effectively with impacted individuals, their families, \nand caregivers. Crisis\
      \ teams should be equipped \nwith communication tools like Picture, Exchange\
      \ \nCommunication Systems (PECS) or other forms \nof Augmentative and Alternative\
      \ Communication \n(AAC), and soothing kits to engage individuals with \nI/DD.24\
      \ Considerations should include potential \ncommunication challenges, cognitive\
      \ limitations, \nphysical health comorbidities, varying verbal skills, \nand/or\
      \ differing social skills levels. Providers should \nhave relationships with\
      \ agencies and systems \nserving individuals with I/DD (e.g., intellectual-\
      \ \nand disability-specific service systems, group \nhomes, skilled nursing\
      \ facilities, assisted living \nand rehabilitation facilities, child welfare\

      \ for coordinating care and referrals \nto these agencies and systems.\nHOUSING\
      \ AND OTHER SOCIAL DRIVERS OF \nHEALTH (SDOH): Unstable housing is a stressor\
      \ \nboth contributing to crisis events and complicating \nresolution of crisis\
      \ events. Assessment of SDOH is \ncritical at every step of a crisis service\
      \ encounter. \nThis includes homelessness, unemployment, \nlack of transportation,\
      \ poverty, and other SDOH. \nLinkages to resources that address basic needs\
      \ \nlike hunger, homelessness, and poverty are \nessential. Crisis providers\
      \ who interact with \nchildren, youth, and families should work closely \nwith\
      \ their state child welfare agency and other \nrelevant state entities to ensure\
      \ protocols around \nmandated reporting are followed and appropriately \ntrain\
      \ crisis providers on the distinction between \nobserved conditions of poverty\

      \ \nHealth Lines\nCrisis and other behavioral health lines are the \nfirst of\
      \ three foundational programmatic elements \nessential to a BHCSCC. They fulfill\
      \ a crucial role \nby offering free and easily accessible support to \nindividuals\
      \ experiencing an acute crisis, those \nfacing barriers to accessing behavioral\
      \ health \ncare, and/or people who support help seekers. \nIn addition, these\
      \ lines are a critical component \nof an evidence-based, public health approach\
      \ to \nsuicide prevention.26\nThis section details the following 988 and other\
      \ \nbehavioral health line categories:\n • 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: previously\
      \ \nknown as the National Suicide Prevention \nLifeline, the 988 Lifeline offers\
      \ 24/7 call, text, \nand chat access to trained crisis counselors \nwho can\
      \ help people experiencing suicidal \nideation, substance use, and/or mental\
      \ health \ncrisis, or any other kind of emotional distress.\n • Other Behavioral\
      \ Health Crisis Hotlines: \nincludes hotlines that are not part of the 988 \n\
      Lifeline network that provide crisis counseling \nto people experiencing emotional\
      \ distress and/\nor third-party callers who are concerned about \nanother person\
      \ in distress.\n • Peer-Operated Warmlines: a phone and/\nor text service run\
      \ by peers (individuals with \nbehavioral health lived experience) that \nprovides\
      \ connection focused on support and \nwellness. These lines share hope, provide\
      \ \ncoaching, and help people navigate the \nrecovery process.\n • Other Behavioral\
      \ Health Emotional Support \nLines: a phone and/or text service operated \n\
      by individuals who are not peers that provides \nconnection focused on support\
      \ and wellness.\nAcross all contact lines, workers should receive \ntraining\
      \ on supporting people with a range of \nbehavioral health issues. It is essential\
      \ to consider \nthe specific needs and preferences of children, \nyouth, and\
      \ families to establish effective points of \ncontact within the crisis care\
      \ continuum, including \nservices detailed in this section. Crisis contact \n\
      centers can be responsive to the needs of young \npeople in several ways. First,\
      \ they should be \nstaffed with an interdisciplinary team, including \nthose\
      \ trained to address child and adolescent-\nspecific behavioral health needs.\
      \ Crisis contact \ncenters should ensure that responders receive \ncrisis training\
      \ such as de-escalation strategies \nthat are specific to young people and any\
      \ family \nmembers who may be present, an understanding \nof mandatory reporting\
      \ requirements in cases \nof adult and child abuse and neglect, typical \ndevelopmental\
      \ milestones and how they may \npresent during a crisis, assessment of family\
      \ \nsystem strengths and challenges, and specific \nstressors and concerns that\
      \ are important for \nchildren and adolescents. They should also be \nfamiliar\

      \ & Crisis Lifeline\nOverview\n“988” is the three-digit, nationwide phone number\
      \ \nto connect directly to a live person at any time via \nthe following four\
      \ options:\n1. Connection to the Veterans Crisis Line;\n2. Connection to the\
      \ national Spanish \nlanguage subnetwork;\n3. Connection to the national LGB\
      \ subnetwork for \nyouth and young adults; or\n4. Option to remain on the line\
      \ or press 0 to be \nconnected to a local trained counselor who can \nlisten\
      \ and provide local support resources.\nIndividuals seeking to access 988 can\
      \ make \ncontact by call, chat, text, or videophone. If an \nindividual requests\
      \ access to one of the national \nsubnetworks, they are connected to that service.\
      \ \nLocal routing is available for individual contacts \nthat do not request\
      \ connection to a national \nsubnetwork.\nLifeline operators engage with callers\
      \ to promote \ncollaboration and explore care options and safety \nplans together.\n\
      In September of 2024, SAMHSA led collaboration \nwith the Lifeline Administrator,\
      \ federal partners, \nand telecommunications providers to begin \nactivation\
      \ of geo-routing for calls. The geo-\nrouting process directs individuals to\
      \ the nearest \ncrisis contact center without providing precise \nlocation information.\
      \ For carriers which have \nnot yet activated geo-routing and for all text \n\
      communications, contacts are currently routed \nbased upon the individual’s\
      \ area code. With the \nrecent Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) rule,\
      \ it is expected that all carriers will \nactivate geo-routing for both calls\
      \ and texts in the \ncoming months and years.28\nBackground\nCongress first\
      \ appropriated funding for a suicide \nprevention hotline in 2001. After SAMHSA\
      \ awarded \na competitive grant to a single grantee to establish \na network\
      \ of crisis contact centers, the National \nSuicide Prevention Lifeline launched\
      \ in 2005 with \nthe number 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).29\nThe National Suicide Hotline\

      \ and the \nPresident signed, the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2022 (P.L.\
      \ 117–103), which provided $5 million \nto establish the 988 Lifeline and BHCCO\
      \ under \nSAMHSA’s Office of the Assistant Secretary \nfor Mental Health and\
      \ Substance Use. This \nlegislation also established SAMHSA as the lead \nfederal\
      \ behavioral health crisis services entity. \nIn conjunction with a 988 Lifeline\
      \ Administrator \n(funded via a cooperative agreement with \nSAMHSA), they oversee\
      \ administration of the \n988 Lifeline system with formal expectations \nof\
      \ clinical, technical, and operational network \nperformance.\nThe Lifeline\
      \ Administrator is responsible for \nleadership and coordination of 200+ individual\
      \ \nstate and locally funded crisis contact centers \nacross the country. Each\
      \ individual center is \nresponsible for abiding by a series of requirements\
      \ \nthat include, but are not limited to, an accreditation \nprocess, practice\
      \ insurance, a formal agreement \nwith the Lifeline Administrator, and a center\
      \ liaison.\nCenters should provide training for all crisis \ncontact center\
      \ staff consistent with the 988 Lifeline \nSuicide Safety Policy and the 988\
      \ Lifeline Safety \nAssessment Model. The minimum training includes \ncompletion\
      \ of all 988 Lifeline Core Clinical Training \nCourses and the completion of\
      \ a designated \nnumber and type of live role plays reflecting the \ntype of\
      \ information and care that staff will be \nexpected to provide. For additional\
      \ information \nabout the 988 Lifeline, please see SAMHSA’s \nSaving Lives in\
      \ America: 988 Quality and Services \nPlan (PDF).\nService Description\nThe\
      \ 988 Lifeline is a behavioral health network \nof crisis contact centers that\
      \ provides crisis and \nemergency mental health and substance use \nservices\
      \ 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 \ndays a year (24/7/365) to people\
      \ experiencing any \nform of emotional distress or to a third party who is \n\
      concerned about another person.\nState of Service-Related Evidence\nExisting\
      \ evidence for the effectiveness of \ncrisis lines has primarily focused on\
      \ short-term \nimprovements in user distress and on user \nsatisfaction. A study\
      \ conducted from October 2017 \nto June 2018 using data from 39,911 pre-chat\
      \ \nsurveys and 13,130 pre- and post-chats found \nthat those who chatted with\
      \ the 988 Lifeline were \nsignificantly less distressed at the end of the chat\
      \ \nintervention than at the beginning of the chat.30,31 \nA follow-up study\
      \ found that two-thirds of suicidal \ncallers reported thatf the conversation\
      \ had been \nhelpful and nearly half of suicidal callers reported \nthey were\
      \ feeling less suicidal after the chat \nintervention.\nA study that analyzed\
      \ third-party calls to the \nLifeline regarding individuals at imminent risk\
      \ found \nthat crisis counselors were able to successfully \nassess risk and\
      \ implement interventions, applying \nnon-emergency interventions in 68.6 percent\
      \ of \ncalls. These findings emphasize the importance of \nthird-party calls,\
      \ which represent about 25 percent \nof all Lifeline calls, in reaching individuals\
      \ who may \nnot seek help on their own.32\nA recently completed evaluation of\
      \ 988 Lifeline \neffectiveness from 2019 to 2023 similarly showed \nthat a high\
      \ percentage of callers interviewed \nfollowing a Lifeline interaction or participating\
      \ in \na post-call survey reported that the call stopped \nthem from attempting\
      \ suicide. Interviewed callers \nreported that their counselors engaged to a\

      following crisis encounters.34 This includes time \nafter crisis calls, ED discharges,\
      \ and inpatient \npsychiatric hospitalizations. One SAMHSA-funded \nstudy found\
      \ that 43 percent of suicidal Lifeline \ncallers who completed evaluation follow-up\

      \ or attempt) in \nthe weeks after their crisis call, and only 22.5 \npercent\
      \ of suicidal callers had been seen by \nthe mental healthcare system to which\
      \ they had \nbeen referred.35\nBased in part on the SAMHSA-funded studies \n\
      noted previously, SAMHSA funded an initiative \nin 2008 to offer and provide\
      \ follow-up to all 988 \nLifeline callers who reported suicidal desire \nduring\
      \ or within 48 hours before making a call to \nthe Lifeline. An evaluation of\
      \ this initiative, which \nincluded interviews with 550 callers followed by\
      \ 41 \ncrisis counselors from six crisis contact centers, \nrevealed that 79.6\
      \ percent of callers interviewed \n6–12 weeks after their crisis call reported\
      \ that \nthe follow-up calls stopped them from attempting \nsuicide.36 Callers\
      \ said the follow-up call gave them \nhope, made them feel cared about, and\
      \ helped \nthem connect to further mental health resources.\nA number of additional\
      \ studies have documented \nthe benefit of follow-up care. Outcomes from an\
      \ \napproach that included initial safety planning \ninterventions (in various\
      \ settings) and a follow-\nup phone contact included improved treatment \nengagement,\
      \ decreased risk of hospitalization, \nand reduced suicidal behaviors.37,38,39,40\

      \ with explicit requirements \nfor follow-up care in the National Suicide Hotline\

      \ \nof the 988 Lifeline network but that also provide \nsupport to people experiencing\
      \ emotional distress \nand/or to third-party callers who are concerned \nabout\
      \ another person. These hotlines typically fall \ninto one or more of the following\
      \ categories:\n1. Topically focused to a specific type of need \nor  stressor;\n\
      2. Focused on providing services to a specific \npopulation (e.g., a county\

      \ local crisis lines are being phased out as \n988 Lifeline centers address\
      \ more local contacts.\nStaffing, Structure, and Oversight\nOther than the creation\
      \ of guidelines, standards, \nand definitions, SAMHSA does not provide formal\
      \ \noversight to other behavioral health crisis hotlines. \nAlthough individual\
      \ hotline administrators are \nable to determine their own service provision\
      \ and \nstaffing details, SAMHSA advises that all hotlines \nadvertised as “crisis”\
      \ should have the capacity to \nscreen each caller for suicide and have protocols\
      \ \nin place for positive suicide screenings as well as \noffer 24/7/365 availability.\n\
      Service Description\nThe hotlines in this service category refer to \nbehavioral\
      \ health crisis hotlines that may be \nmore topically focused on a specific\
      \ type of need \nor stressor, sometimes focused on a specific \npopulation of\
      \ focus (e.g., a county or other \ngeographic catchment area), as well as those\
      \ that \nmay target the needs of individuals experiencing \nthe types of emotional\
      \ distress that are similar in \nscope to the 988 Lifeline but are not connected\
      \ to \nthe 988 Lifeline.\nState of Service-Related Evidence\nBehavioral health\
      \ crisis hotline research typically \nfocuses on process measures (e.g., how\
      \ many \ncalls were placed and the typical demographic of \ncallers), varying\
      \ hotline modalities, and suicide \nrisk assessment best practices. For example,\
      \ a \nmeta-analysis of 64 studies found that there was \nno difference in effectiveness\
      \ when comparing \nface-to-face and internet intervention, supporting \nthe\
      \ development of hotlines with multiple entry \npoints for users.41\nStructured\
      \ and consistent suicide risk assessments \nare noted as a best practice during\
      \ crisis care calls. \nAcross the collective research, results indicate that\
      \ \nother behavioral health crisis hotline counselors \nare not likely to ask\
      \ callers about current and \npast suicide ideations,42 which, the research\
      \ \nsuggests, is a missed opportunity to provide critical \nsupport. The 988\
      \ Lifeline guidelines recommend \nasking questions such as “are you currently\
      \ \nthinking of suicide?” (current ideation), “have you \nthought about suicide\
      \ in the last two months?” \n(recent ideation), and “have you ever attempted\
      \ \nto kill yourself?” (attempt).43 A streamlined risk \nassessment process\
      \ may be an effective way to \ndecrease the likelihood of repeat contacts for\
      \ the \nsame behavioral health crisis episode.\nThe Applied Suicide Intervention\
      \ Skills Training \n(ASIST) is an example of a best practice for crisis \nhotlines.\
      \ ASIST can be administered by anyone \n16 years of age and over and is suitable\
      \ for adults \nand older teens. For younger teens and children, \nthe ASIST\
      \ approach can be effective if adapted to \nmeet their developmental needs and\
      \ potentially \nwith parent and/or family engagement.44 A study \nthat examined\
      \ the impact of the implementation of \nASIST found that this training yielded\
      \ significantly \nlonger calls and an increased number of \n“invitations” (i.e.,\
      \ signs of suicide risk) revealed by \ncallers. Counselors that received the\
      \ training were \nmore likely to try to link the callers’ invitations to \n\
      suicidal thoughts, explore reasons for living and \nambivalence about dying,\

      \ warmlines provide ongoing phone, \ntext, or chat support by an individual\
      \ with lived \nexperience. Calls are answered by trained peers \nwho have lived\
      \ experience with the type of mental \nhealth support the line is intended to\
      \ provide. \nPeer-operated warmlines are typically local to \nthe caller’s jurisdiction\
      \ or state, though there \nalso are national peer warmlines geared toward \n\
      specific groups such as teens, older adults, and \nLGB individuals. Consumer,\
      \ youth, and family-run \norganizations usually offer warmlines as well as \n\
      support and connection for those in crisis. As of \n2023, nearly all states\
      \ had one or more peer-\noperated warmlines. The National Alliance on \nMental\
      \ Illness (NAMI) provides a NAMI National \nWarmline Directory.46\nPeer-operated\
      \ warmlines serve a critical role in \nsupporting people experiencing emotional\
      \ distress. \nThey provide timely and responsive access to \nsupport, peer coaching,\
      \ and support for systems \nnavigation to individuals experiencing behavioral\
      \ \nhealth crisis.47\nBackground\nPeer-operated warmlines first emerged in the\
      \ \n1990s when the concept of support provided by \npeers began gaining traction.\
      \ Peer warmlines \nhighlight key principles that promote healthy peer \nrelationships\
      \ such as trauma-informed ways \nof relating, starting with no assumptions about\
      \ \nthe experience or problem of the help-seeking \nindividual, and the importance\
      \ of mutually \naccountable relationships and communities.48\nStaffing, Structure,\
      \ and Oversight\nThere are multiple expectations for operating and \nstaffing\
      \ a peer warmline. Support specialists should \nbe certified by the state or\
      \ jurisdiction and should \nhave access to additional recovery and resilience\
      \ \nresources specific to their role. They also should \nreceive peer supervision\
      \ when they first begin \nresponding to warmline contacts.\nService Description\n\
      Peer-operated behavioral health warmlines are \nphone, chat, or text lines that\
      \ provide empathetic \nlistening and peer support to individuals who \nmay be\
      \ experiencing distress, loneliness, or who \nare seeking validation from a\
      \ peer with lived \nexperience who identifies with their struggles and \noffers\
      \ a confidential and non-judgmental space \nfor connection and self-directed\
      \ exploration of \npossible solutions and alternatives. Peers work \ncollaboratively\
      \ and transparently with callers or \nservice recipients within a recovery-\
      \ and resilience-\noriented care framework to facilitate safety \nplanning,\
      \ crisis support planning and prevention, \nand informed choice.\nState of Service-Related\
      \ Evidence\nResearch on peer-operated warmlines focuses \non their effectiveness\
      \ in making callers feel heard \nand supported and the extent to which warmlines\

      \ from a phone survey completed by \n480 warmline callers found that peer-operated\
      \ \nwarmlines provided an important mechanism of \nsupport. These findings were\
      \ consistent regardless \nof the time of day the calls were placed. Lines that\
      \ \nwere open past 5:00 p.m. local time, however, \npresented an opportunity\
      \ to provide support not \ntypically available in the evenings or at night,\
      \ which \ncan be helpful to alleviate feelings of loneliness or \nisolation.\
      \ Warmlines are an important resource to \nsupplement other mental health services\
      \ in both \nrural and urban areas.49\nA study on the findings from a Recovery\
      \ \nAssessment Scale (a validated tool that asks \nrespondents to provide their\
      \ level of agreement \non statements pertaining to their perception of self\
      \ \nand feelings of self-worth), community integration \nmeasures, and crisis\

      primary care doctors, increased leisure/recreation \nactivities, and increased\
      \ socialization with others \nafter warmline interaction.50,51\nAccording to\
      \ the American Psychological \nAssociation, young people often feel more \n\

      \ Hand-offs to peer-\noperated warmlines, when clinically indicated, are \n\
      therefore particularly necessary to address the \nneeds of children and youth\

      Other behavioral health emotional support lines \nfocus on providing connection\
      \ and wellness \npromotion. They are not hotlines; however, they \nare still\
      \ expected to have the capacity to determine \nif referral to a crisis hotline\
      \ or more intensive \nintervention is warranted. They are sometimes \nreferred\
      \ to as helplines. Prominent examples \ninclude SAMHSA’s National Helpline,\
      \ the Alcohol \nand Drug Helpline, and the Alzheimer’s Association \n24/7 Helpline.\n\
      Other behavioral health emotional support \nlines are recognized for providing\
      \ services \nsuch as active, empathetic listening, safety \nplanning, rapport\
      \ building, and crisis support and \nprevention planning.\nStaffing, Structure,\
      \ and Oversight\nUnlike peer-operated warmlines, other behavioral \nhealth emotional\
      \ support lines may not be staffed \nby peers. They are often embedded within\
      \ a multi-\nservice organization.\nService Description\nOther behavioral health\
      \ emotional support \nlines are phone, chat, or text lines that provide \nempathetic\
      \ listening, information and referral, and \nsupport to individuals who may\

      \ challenge and opportunity that states, \ntribes, and territories are tackling\
      \ in different ways.\nFirst, coordination requires protocols, procedures, \n\
      and agreements that allow for and dictate the need \nfor transfer of calls between\
      \ the two entities. In a \nseries of three state case studies conducted by the\
      \ \nRAND Corporation, researchers identified several \nkey components common\
      \ to states navigating \ninteroperability:57\n1. Clearly articulated decision\
      \ points regarding \nthe transfer of calls between entities was a key \nfactor\
      \ in successful coordination.\n2. Effective planning and implementation \nacross\
      \ entities should include a collaborative \napproach, engaging a variety of\
      \ partners, \nand the development of shared language and \nmutual respect.\n\
      3. A local champion for interoperability serves \nas a critical facilitator\
      \ for successful planning \nand implementation.\n4. 988-911 interoperability\
      \ requires more \nthan just protocols for transferring between \nthe two entities;\
      \ these vary by state and \nshould be decided upon via the partner \ncollaboration\
      \ process.\nWhere possible, formal agreements are \nrecommended to strengthen\
      \ collaboration. An \nadditional critical feature of the collaboration is a\
      \ \nstructure to regularly review challenging cases and \nadverse outcomes for\
      \ system improvement.\nLastly, an important aspect of effective coordination\
      \ \nis the role of law enforcement who, with their \npartners, frequently play\
      \ a role in crisis response \nas they are often the first responders in a crisis\
      \ \nsituation in which the caller accessed 911. For \neffective 988-911 coordination,\
      \ it is necessary for \nlaw enforcement partners to receive the necessary \n\
      tools and training to improve practices with an eye \ntoward less restrictive\
      \ responses.58 SAMHSA’s \nBHCCO currently is developing a toolkit to help \n\
      address 911 and other first responder concerns \nabout risk and liability when\
      \ encountering and \nproviding assistance to individuals experiencing a \nbehavioral\
      \ health crisis.\nOther Behavioral Health Hotlines, Topic-\nSpecific Hotlines,\
      \ Emotional Support Lines, \nand Warmlines and 988 Intersection\nThere are opportunities\
      \ for hand-offs among the \n988 Lifeline, other behavioral health hotlines,\
      \ \ntopic-specific hotlines, peer-operated warmlines, \nand emotional support\
      \ lines. These warm hand-offs \nwhere staff from both lines share information\
      \ will \nhelp ensure that individuals and communities can \nhave access to care\
      \ tailored to their specific needs. \nThe warm hand-off approach may be particularly\
      \ \nimpactful for children and youth in crisis as they \nmay be more likely\
      \ to seek support from a peer-\noperated warmline.\nThe National Association\
      \ of State Mental Health \nProgram Directors’ (NASMHPD) 988 Convening \nPlaybook:\
      \ Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) \nrecommends that the process for hand-offs\
      \ and \nreferrals should be supported by a regularly \nupdated database of available\
      \ resources.59 All \n988 Lifeline crisis contact centers should maintain \n\
      a regularly updated database of other behavioral \nhealth hotlines and warmlines\
      \ to which they can \nprovide warm hand-offs to individuals in need \nof care\
      \ beyond the scope of the 988 Lifeline \ncapabilities. 988 Lifeline crisis staff\
      \ also should \nbe trained to facilitate warm hand-offs to minimize \ncaller\
      \ disengagement.\nSimilarly, behavioral health hotlines can transfer \ncallers\
      \ to a 988 Lifeline crisis contact center in \ncases when they do not have the\
      \ capacity to \nrespond effectively to the callers’ needs. This \nshould be\
      \ supported by a warm hand-off approach.\n32\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral\

      \ callers to 211.\nThe 211 system has a long-standing history of \nusing the\
      \ Inform USA (formerly the Alliance of \nInformation & Referral Systems (AIRS))\
      \ standards \nfor classification and taxonomy as a framework for \norganizing\
      \ referrals databases including standards \nrelated to inclusion criteria, data\
      \ structure and \nelements, classification and taxonomy, content \nmanagement,\
      \ and database data collection \nanalysis and reporting. 988 centers should\
      \ be \nfamiliar with these standards when creating a \nreferral database and\
      \ consider using them to \nensure efficient referral provision and sharing of\
      \ \ncommunity referral information.\nIntegrated Crisis Response for Mental Health\
      \ \nand Substance Use\nTo fully realize the potential of a BHCSCC, \ninterventions\
      \ should be capable of responding \nto the needs of individuals with substance\
      \ use, \nmental health, and/or both with an integrated \napproach based upon\
      \ a help seeker’s needs and \npreferences. This includes having staff trained\
      \ in \nconducting targeted screening and assessment, \nlevel of care assessment,\
      \ medical monitoring and \ntriage, brief counseling interventions, as well as\
      \ \nensuring referral services have the capacity to \nprovide withdrawal management,\
      \ stabilization, \nand medication initiation. Operators of behavioral \nhealth\
      \ lines should be aware of resources that \nsupport the full array of needs\
      \ of a caller, including \nSUD needs. This also is a crucial area where \ncoordination\
      \ and protocol development with 911 is \ncritical, as substance-related situations,\
      \ including \nintoxication, withdrawal, and/or overdose, require \nthe 988 Lifeline\
      \ to collaborate closely with the \n911 system.\nData, Evaluation, and Quality\
      \ \nImprovement\nRegular data collection and well-implemented \nevaluation plans\
      \ help ensure the continuing \neffectiveness of 988 and other behavioral health\
      \ \nlines. Measures such as call volume, response \ntimes, user demographics,\
      \ and rates of successful \nfollow-up provide crisis contact centers with \n\
      important information on the extent to which \nthey are meeting the needs of\
      \ their community \nand provide opportunities for continuous \nquality improvement.\n\
      Insights from data also provide centers the \nopportunity to identify trends\
      \ and patterns in the \ntypes of crises being reported. This information can\
      \ \ninform targeted interventions, resource allocation, \nand other support\
      \ services to improve the care \nprovided to a community.\nCommunities currently\

      \ \nand other behavioral health crisis lines. A sample \nlist of metrics to\
      \ help demonstrate outcomes and \nimpact of these services (provided by call,\
      \ chat, \nand text) includes but is not limited to:\n • Number of unique individuals\

      \ communities and better meet the \nneeds of individuals in crisis, SAMHSA,\
      \ working \nwith the 988 Lifeline Administrator and other \nkey partners, has\
      \ made the 988 Lifeline more \naccessible by offering chat and text services\
      \ in \nSpanish; launching a new video-phone option for \nindividuals who are\
      \ deaf or hard of hearing; and \nintroducing specialized access for LGB youth\

      2. Someone to Respond: Mobile Crisis and \nOutreach Services\nMobile crisis\
      \ and outreach services are an \nessential component of the crisis continuum\
      \ of \ncare, providing community-based support to \nindividuals experiencing\
      \ a crisis wherever they are. \nMobile crisis services were first developed\
      \ in the \nUnited States as part of a de-institutionalization \nmovement in\
      \ the 1960s, as a response to meet \nthe increased needs of the population living\
      \ \nindependently with behavioral health needs.63\nNRI’s 2023 state profiles\
      \ reported that of the 50 \nstates who responded to their survey, 98 percent\
      \ of \nstates have active MCT services, operating 1,820 \nMCTs. Mobile crisis\
      \ services continue to expand \ntheir reach in the United States: 40 states\
      \ saw an \nincrease of 21 percent in the number of individuals \nserved by MCTs\
      \ in 2023 compared with 2022.64\nCommunities across the country have designed\
      \ \ntheir mobile crisis services to rapidly meet the \nneeds of individuals,\
      \ provide support, ensure \nsafety, and coordinate follow-up care. This \nhas\
      \ resulted in variations in service delivery \nand team composition. SAMHSA\

      \ communities have mobile crisis services \navailable that do not involve law\
      \ enforcement, \nrecognizing the potential harm and stigma \nassociated with\
      \ police involvement in behavioral \nhealth crises. In 2023, 96 individuals\
      \ were killed \nafter law enforcement responded to reports of \nsomeone behaving\
      \ erratically or having a mental \nhealth crisis.65 A recent study has shown\
      \ that \nindividuals with behavioral health diagnosis \nand a history of utilizing\
      \ crisis services prefer \nreceiving crisis services from MCTs due to their\
      \ \nspecialized training and minimization of law \nenforcement presence.66\n\
      Peers play a crucial role in outreach services, \ncontributing to enhanced outcomes\
      \ such as \nreduced rates of re-hospitalization, lower overall \nservice costs,\
      \ improved quality of life, fewer \noverdoses, and diminished behavioral health\
      \ \nsymptoms. The peer support model fosters a \nnon-hierarchical relationship\
      \ that is distinct from \nthe dynamic between individuals and clinicians. By\
      \ \nintegrating into the care team, peers bolster the \nsupport system for individuals\
      \ and their families, \naiding them in navigating the recovery process.67\n\
      The National Guidelines for Child and Youth \nBehavioral Health Crisis Care\
      \ (PDF) (2022) \nprovides a comprehensive framework for \naddressing the unique\
      \ needs of children and youth \nexperiencing a behavioral health crisis. These\
      \ \nguidelines emphasize the importance of early \nintervention, family involvement,\
      \ and trauma-\ninformed care. They strongly recommend that \nyouth crisis care\
      \ systems keep youth in their home, \nprovide developmentally appropriate services\
      \ and \nsupports, integrate family and youth peer support, \nand meet the needs\
      \ of all families by providing \nculturally and linguistically appropriate services.\
      \ \nTherefore, the stabilization element of MCTs may \noccur over a long time\
      \ period for youth to achieve \nthese goals.\nMobile crisis and outreach services\
      \ comprise three \nservice models of MCT programming as well as \ncommunity\
      \ outreach teams (the latter represents a \nseparate approach). MCTs provide\
      \ an on-demand, \nrapid, mobile, in-person response that includes a \nlicensed\
      \ or credentialed clinician participating in a \nclinical assessment of an individual\
      \ experiencing \na behavioral health crisis. Although MCTs can vary \nin configuration,\
      \ to meet SAMHSA’s definition their \nservices must be:\n • On-demand and rapid.\
      \ MCT response begins \nupon the acceptance of a dispatch request that \nis\
      \ initiated by a crisis contact (call, electronic \nmessage, or chat).\n • Mobile.\
      \ The MCT goes to the individual in \ncrisis at any community-based location\
      \ (i.e., \nthe response is not limited to specific locations \nsuch as EDs or\
      \ settings that are secure and/or \nstaffed by behavioral health crisis clinicians).\n\
      \ • In-person. At least one crisis staff person \nmust meet face-to-face with\
      \ the individual in \ncrisis (i.e., not a 100% telephonic, online, or \ntelehealth\
      \ interaction).\n • Inclusive of a licensed or credentialed \nprovider. An MCT\
      \ response must include \nengagement by a licensed or credentialed \nbehavioral\
      \ health clinician who participates \nin a clinical assessment of the needs\
      \ of the \nindividual in crisis. If necessary, the clinical \nassessment can\
      \ be done by telehealth if at \nleast one other MCT staff member is on scene\
      \ \nand interacting with the individual face-to-face.\nThe three MCT service\
      \ models include behavioral \nhealth practitioner–only (BHP-only) MCTs, co-\n\
      responder MCTs that involve law enforcement, \nand the MCT services provided\
      \ through mobile \nresponse and stabilization service programming. \nThese models,\
      \ as well as the Community Outreach \nTeam approach, are described in more detail.\n\

      \ In addition to at least one licensed \nor credentialed behavioral health practitioner,\

      BHP-only MCTs provide behavioral health \npractitioner-led responses and are\
      \ considered \nthe best practice for provision of mobile crisis \nservices.\
      \ BHP-only MCTs provide a response that \nincludes a clinical assessment and\
      \ community-\nbased stabilization supports to decrease emotional \ndistress\
      \ and reduce the immediate risk of danger \nand subsequent harm to individuals\
      \ experiencing \na mental health or substance use crisis. Care is \ndelivered\
      \ by a multidisciplinary BHP-only MCT at \nthe location where an individual\
      \ is experiencing a \ncrisis, including, but not limited to, at home, school,\
      \ \nwork, or on the streets. Through community-based \ncrisis care, referrals,\
      \ and care coordination, \nBHP-only MCTs can avoid unnecessary ED care, \npsychiatric\
      \ inpatient hospitalizations, and law \nenforcement involvement. SAMHSA recognizes\
      \ \nthat individual community needs and resources will \ninform which models\
      \ are most suitable. However, \nsome general principles are noted here:\n •\
      \ Activation of BHP-only MCTs should be \nsupported by an intentional triage/screening\
      \ \nprocess in which BHP-only MCT staff assess \nthe risk of the individual/families\
      \ in crisis and \ndetermine the most appropriate response (e.g., \nphone consultation,\
      \ face-to-face BHP-only \nMCT intervention).68\n • Law enforcement presence\
      \ should be \nminimized to the degree possible. In cases \nwhere law enforcement\
      \ is needed or required \nto respond, they should receive extensive \ntraining\
      \ in working with adults and youth \nexperiencing a behavioral health crisis.\n\
      \ • Peer support specialists should be incorporated \nin all models of BHP-only\
      \ MCT delivery.\n • Teams should be configured in a way that is \nattentive\
      \ to the safety and well-being of the \nindividual in crisis as well as team\
      \ members.\n • Teams should be community-based and \nnot restricted to supervised\
      \ settings \n(e.g., schools, hospitals).\n37\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral\

      \ of \nat least two individuals. The pre-dispatch triage \nfunction (whether\
      \ by the MCT itself or a separate \ndispatch entity) is critical to inform the\
      \ most \nappropriate response. Considerations include \nlocation, the concern\
      \ of the caller, degree to which \nthere are immediate life and/or health concerns,\
      \ \nwhether the person seeking help is known to the \nresponders, and whether\
      \ telehealth is available \nand/or appropriate to support the on-site response.\
      \ \nThe MCT response should occur without law \nenforcement unless special circumstances\
      \ warrant \ntheir presence. In cases when law enforcement is \npresent, the\
      \ MCT response should be led by the \nbehavioral health team member unless a\
      \ clear \npublic safety risk exists. MCTs should be well-\ntrained including\
      \ completing standardized training \nand meeting competencies established by\
      \ their \nstate or contract. With training requirements and \naccess to 24/7/365\

      \ \npeer support workers, certified youth and family \npeers, and non-degreed\
      \ trained crisis workers. \nFollow-up visits to continue stabilization efforts,\
      \ \ncoordinate care, and make referrals can generally \nbe performed by any\
      \ team member, but may vary \nbased on the specific follow-up needs of that\
      \ \nindividual (i.e., ongoing stabilization or assessment \nmay need a licensed\
      \ or credentialed staff person \nto provide follow-up care). MCT services should\
      \ \nbe provided under the supervision of a behavioral \nhealth professional\
      \ licensed and/or credentialed \nin accordance with state law to be able to\
      \ \nprovide oversight of the individuals providing \ncare. Examples of individuals\
      \ who might provide \nsupervision include licensed physicians, social \nworkers,\
      \ or counselors.\nChildren and youth mobile crisis services can be \nintegrated\
      \ into a MCT that serves the lifespan or a \ndedicated team that is specific\
      \ to this age group. \nServices should be centered on de-escalation and \nstabilization\
      \ within the home and community. This \nis an important priority for all crisis\

      \ their families, and other community \npartners to improve behavioral health\
      \ crisis \nresponse and outcomes.77 Law enforcement \nmembers of CITs typically\
      \ receive training such \nas CIT or Crisis Response Intervention Training \n\
      (CRIT), which is a 40-hour training program \ndeveloped to educate law enforcement\
      \ officers on \nhow to respond to adults and youth experiencing \na behavioral\
      \ health crisis.78 Co-response teams \nare especially common in rural areas\
      \ where crisis \nworkforce limitations are significant. Co-response \nteams\
      \ can leverage the partnership of behavioral \nhealth providers and law enforcement\
      \ officers or \nother public safety-first responders to reduce the \nneed for\
      \ hospitalization or emergency medical \nservices and increase the diversion\
      \ of people \nwith behavioral health concerns from the criminal \njustice system.\n\
      SAMHSA recommends implementation of co-\nresponder teams as an additional service\
      \ option \nand not a replacement for BHP-only MCTs. Each \ncommunity needs to\
      \ weigh the risks and benefits \nof co-response teams with their specific needs\
      \ \nand access to care challenges. Communities \nthat choose to use co-response\
      \ teams should \ndevelop their own optimal team composition \nand processes\
      \ based on their community needs \nand the community response to the service.\
      \ For \nexample, co-response teams that include law \nenforcement can be stigmatizing\
      \ and reinforce \nthe criminalization of mental illness. Further, \nthe American\
      \ with Disabilities Act (ADA), which \nprohibits discrimination towards and\
      \ offers \nequal opportunity for people with disabilities, \noutlines that people\
      \ with disabilities have the \nsame opportunities to participate in state and\
      \ \nlocal government programs in addition to other \nguarantees.79 DOJ has noted\
      \ that this includes \naccess to emergency response services and there \nis\
      \ current legal precedent that indicates that an \nover-reliance on law enforcement\
      \ for those with \nmental health emergencies is a violation of the \nADA.80\
      \ The U.S. Supreme Court further determined \nin Olmstead v. L.C. that unjustified\
      \ segregation of \npeople with disabilities violates the ADA as a form \nof\
      \ unlawful discrimination.81\nBenefits of the co-responder model include the\
      \ \nfact that law enforcement may have the ability to \ntravel distances or\
      \ difficult terrain more quickly \nor respond to scenarios where civilian BHP-only\
      \ \nsafety may be of a concern. Fire and EMS often \nare associated with less\
      \ stigma, and this work \ncould complement other programs such as a \ncommunity\
      \ paramedicine program.82 Programmatic \ndetails such as who operates or manages\
      \ the \nprogram (law enforcement or a behavioral health \nprovider), the types\
      \ of uniforms worn, the degree to \nwhich the team is embedded in the community,\
      \ and \nthe acculturation of first responders to behavioral \nhealth culture,\
      \ are all important considerations in \nco-responder models. It is important\
      \ to note that the \nchoice for the type of MCT team (BHP-only or co-\nresponder)\
      \ is not one of mutual exclusivity. With the \nproper degree of coordination\
      \ and collaboration, \nthese teams can co-exist within a community to \nprovide\
      \ complementary services.\nState of Service-Related Evidence\nThere is evidence\
      \ that co-response teams may \nlead to improved outcomes in comparison to law\
      \ \nenforcement-only responses to behavioral health \ncalls.83 One recent study\
      \ found that specialized \nbehavioral health training of law enforcement \n\
      officers was key to reducing arrest rates and injury \nduring crisis co-response.84\
      \ Regarding the personal \npreference of individuals that have previously \n\
      received mobile crisis services and their families, \none study showed that\
      \ they preferred co-response \nteams led by a clinician over a law enforcement-\n\
      only response, highlighting that the training, \nexpertise, and empathy of the\
      \ clinician is perceived \n40\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral Health\

      \ \nthe entire state. Families can call for help to \naddress a crisis, as defined\
      \ by the family. MRSS \nresponds to the home within one hour or finds a \nconvenient\
      \ time for the family within 24 hours of \nthe initial call. MRSS works alongside\
      \ the family \nto address the presenting crisis and is prepared to \nprovide\
      \ intervention services during the 72 hours \nfollowing the dispatch request.\
      \ A plan is developed \nthat focuses on strategies to obtain the desired \n\
      outcomes and avoid a future crisis. MRSS also \nlinks and refers families to\
      \ other services to \nsupport further stabilization.\nMore Information\n • State\

      \ \nServices (MRSS)\nService Description\nMRSS is a youth- and family-specific\
      \ crisis \nintervention model rooted in Systems of Care \nprinciples that recognize\
      \ the developmental needs \nof children, the role of families or caregivers,\
      \ \nand the importance of avoiding out-of-home \nplacements or the removal of\
      \ youth from their \nschool and community. MRSS models have been \nimplemented\
      \ in numerous states and localities, \nand some communities are beginning to\
      \ apply the \nMRSS model to adult services as well.88\nMRSS allows for young\
      \ people and families to \ndefine the crisis and offers face-to-face responses\
      \ \nregardless of acuity and/or presenting need. This \nuniversal access approach\
      \ prevents delays in care \nthat can lead to worsening outcomes and the need\
      \ \nfor higher intensity services both in the immediate \ntime period and throughout\
      \ the lifespan.\nMRSS supports families wherever the crisis is \ntaking place\
      \ in the community. Youth and families \nmay request MRSS themselves, although\
      \ youth-\nserving systems (e.g., schools) also frequently \nmake these requests.\
      \ MRSS supports de-\nescalation, assessment, education and coping \nskills,\
      \ safety planning, identification of next steps, \nreferrals to additional care\
      \ (as needed), transitions \nto crisis stabilization or hospital settings (as\
      \ \nneeded), and follow-up services. MRSS offers \nstabilization services that\
      \ focus on community-\nbased care coordination to engage, plan, monitor, \n\
      adjust, and offer support and care. Further \ndetails on this component of the\
      \ MRSS model \nare discussed in the crisis stabilization section of \nthis document.\n\
      State of Service-Related Evidence\nMultiple studies have found evidence for\
      \ the \neffectiveness of MRSS. One study of MRSS \nimplementation in Connecticut\
      \ found a reduction \nof 20–25 percent in youth ED utilization over an \n18-month\
      \ timeframe.89 In New Jersey, 98 percent \nof the young people who received\
      \ MRSS services \nremained in their home.90 In Oklahoma, 83 percent \nof children,\
      \ youth, and young adults receiving \nMRSS were successfully diverted from any\
      \ change \nin their living environment.91\n42\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral\

      \ Outreach Teams (COTs) are not crisis \nproviders but instead offer important\
      \ crisis-related \nservices and engage in outreach to communities \nand community\
      \ members to support a variety of \nneeds including behavioral health, physical\
      \ care, \nhousing, benefits, education, and employment. \nCOTs do not provide\

      \ to promote wellness, \nresilience, recovery, self-advocacy, development \n\
      of supports, and maintenance of community \nliving skills while connecting often\
      \ marginalized \nindividuals to community resources. COTs can \nwork effectively\

      \ with dual roles of mobile \ncrisis services and COTs. COTs can be especially\
      \ \nhelpful for follow-up care. COTs can serve a \ncomplementary function but\
      \ are not meant to \nreplace MCT services and it is SAMHSA’s vision \nfor the\
      \ entire nation that MCT services should \nbe available to anyone, anytime,\
      \ and anywhere \nand connected to the 988 Lifeline so that anyone \nacross the\
      \ country can get an in-person response \nif they need additional support after\
      \ a contact \nwith 988.\nGeographic Considerations\nExpectations related to\
      \ response time and \ncomposition of the MCT should consider \ngeography, culture,\
      \ travel conditions, weather, and \ncrisis workforce limitations in urban, suburban,\
      \ \nrural and remote areas, and tribal communities. \nFor example, while MCT\
      \ best practice is a team \nof two responders in person to the location of the\
      \ \ncrisis, a two-person team may not be available due \nto crisis workforce\
      \ shortages and travel distances. \nA response model of one person to the location\
      \ \nwith a remote clinician providing telehealth services \nmay be considered\
      \ as a possible adaptation upon \nconsidering particular situations.93\nAnother\
      \ MCT best practice is limiting law \nenforcement involvement to situations\
      \ with \nimminent safety concerns. MCTs should recognize \nthat historically\
      \ underserved or oppressed \npopulations (e.g., racial/ethnic minority and tribal\
      \ \npopulations) lack trust and confidence in law \nenforcement. However, in\

      \ connect people \nexperiencing non-violent mental health crises with \nthe\
      \ right care and supports by providing responses \nthat best match residents’\
      \ needs. HEART has \nseveral components that support the integration of \nelements\
      \ of the behavioral health crisis system into \nthe public safety first responder\
      \ system.\nThese activities include crisis call diversion \nwhereby mental health\
      \ professionals in the 911 \nPublic Safety Access Point call center and allows\
      \ \nmental health responders to de-escalate crises \nthat might have otherwise\
      \ led to a police response \nover the phone. HEART Care Navigators follow \n\
      up with these callers and complete follow-ups as \nwell. The program also has\
      \ community response \nteams, which are three-person unarmed units \nconsisting\
      \ of a licensed mental health professional, \nan EMT, and a peer support provider.\
      \ These \nteams are dispatched through the 911 PSAP and \nrespond to calls for\
      \ issues including trespassing, \npublic intoxication,, welfare checks, and\
      \ suicidality \nwithout the presence of a weapon. These teams \noften transport\
      \ people to relevant services and \nresources as well as carry supplies like\
      \ snacks, \nclothing, tents, and sleeping bags. Additionally, \nHEART also has\
      \ an additional co-responder \ncomponent that sends clinicians and police officers\

      \ are responding.94 Therefore, while it is best \npractice to avoid including\
      \ law enforcement on \nMCTs, SAMHSA recognizes that involving law \nenforcement\

      \ \nCenter is responsible for managing emergency \ncalls (911) and dispatching\
      \ appropriate services, \nincluding MCTs. Mobile crisis services and the \n\
      police department developed a plan to coordinate \neach response based on severity\
      \ and other \nfactors, operationalizing the philosophy of ensuring \nthe “right\
      \ care, in the right setting, when they need \nit.” In January 2024, 84 percent\

      \ services, outpatient behavioral \nhealth providers, or community support services\
      \ \noffer smooth transitions with a person-centered \napproach. This practice\

      hand-offs also are needed for safety and stability \nin some circumstances,\
      \ such as when transporting \na young person in medical distress and in need\
      \ of \nstabilization services.\nMobile Crisis Coordination with 911 and \nLaw\
      \ Enforcement\nTo ensure a collaborative community approach \nto crises, it\
      \ is important for MCTs to build a \npartnership with 911 and local law enforcement\
      \ \nentities. Education, relationship building, and \non-scene collaboration\
      \ are key elements of \nthese partnerships. The CIT model promotes \nbuilding\
      \ relationships within the BHCSCC to \nensure alignment, identify collective\
      \ community \ngoals, and find ways innovate to improve access \nand collaboration.95\n\
      Mobile Crisis Coordination with Behavioral \nHealth Service Continuum\nMCTs\
      \ should be familiar with the available \nbehavioral health treatment options\
      \ in their \ncommunity (including SUD treatment facilities \nand CCBHCs) and\
      \ should work with other entities \nto establish formal and informal collaborations\
      \ \nto ensure quick access to care for help seekers. \nMCTs can help achieve\
      \ and sustain stabilization by \nfacilitating help seeker connection to specialized\
      \ \nbehavioral health supports and services when \nneeded—“the right care at\
      \ the right time.”\nMobile Crisis Coordination with Other \nCommunity Resources\n\
      MCTs should nurture relationships with culturally \nappropriate resources, such\
      \ as religious \ncommunities, immigrant or refugee resources, \nand support\
      \ groups. In addition, they should have \naccess to on-demand language service\

      \ During \nthe process of selecting metrics, these entities \nshould ensure\
      \ that metrics are informed by their \nquality assurance framework and BHCSCC\
      \ vision \nin their communities. Select examples of mobile \ncrisis services\
      \ quality metrics in use in some \ncommunities include:\n • Number of unique\
      \ individuals served;\n • Number of service requests;\n • Number of mobile crisis\
      \ activations;\n • ZIP Code (if voluntarily provided) of \nindividual served;\n\
      \ • Referral source;\n • Presenting problems;\n • Response time;\n • Demographic\
      \ information (when not \nanonymous);\n • Language;\n • Event disposition (this\
      \ can include resolutions \nin community, transfer to ED, etc.);\n • Diversion\
      \ (e.g., from 911, law enforcement);\n • Collaboration with PSAP;\n • Collaboration\
      \ with MCT;\n • Law enforcement involvement;\n • Involuntary intervention; and\n\
      \ • Restraint use.\nIn addition to the quality metrics, developing a \nmechanism\
      \ to gather participant satisfaction \nfeedback with surveys and/or interviews\
      \ is a \ncrucial step toward building a BHCSCC response \nthat is centered on\
      \ and reflective of participant \nexperiences. Partners are also encouraged\
      \ to look \nat existing measures in SAMHSA’s Performance \nAccountability and\
      \ Reporting System (SPARS).\nIt is important to recognize that MCTs often \n\
      encounter difficulty obtaining important data, \nparticularly demographic information,\
      \ during a \ncrisis event. The acuity of some crises, the quick \nresponse nature,\
      \ and the necessity to build a \ntrusting relationship with the person in crisis\
      \ poses \na challenge to requesting individual demographic \ndata during the\
      \ intervention. However, \ndemographic information is important to assess \n\
      and help progress towards a more equitable \nBHCSCC that is improving care for\
      \ underserved \ncommunities. At times, data collection may be \nmore appropriate\
      \ post intervention.\n3. A Safe Place for Help: Emergency and Crisis \nStabilization\
      \ Services\nEmergency and crisis stabilization services reflect \na range of\
      \ models and care to support individuals \nthrough emergent and urgent behavioral\
      \ health \nneeds. Emergency and crisis stabilization \nservices include facility-,\
      \ home-, and community-\nbased services that provide access to care \nand stabilization\
      \ for adults and youth in crisis. \nEmergency and crisis stabilization services\
      \ are \ndelivered across a continuum of care that includes \nno-barrier, low-barrier,\
      \ and referral-based services.\nThe range of services in this section are \n\
      categorized by the breadth of the on-demand \nreceiving capacity. For example,\
      \ no-barrier \nemergency services are available for anyone and \nat anytime,\
      \ regardless of acuity, including people \nwho voluntarily walk in and/or are\
      \ brought by law \nenforcement and/or EMS, both voluntarily and/or \ninvoluntarily.\
      \ Low-barrier services typically receive \nwalk-ins and people who present voluntarily\
      \ \nthough may screen out those who are involuntarily \n46\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\n\

      \ This may \nlead to a difference in acuity of the individuals \nwho are presenting\
      \ for care with the no-barrier \nsetting having a potentially higher acuity\
      \ of service \nneeds and therefore offering a higher intensity of \nservices.\
      \ Referral-based services do not permit \nwalk-ins and have established admission\
      \ protocols \nto ensure that the environment is suitable for a help \nseeker’s\
      \ needs.\nAcross all settings, emergency and crisis \nstabilization services\
      \ should offer a safe \nenvironment where individuals can receive \nsupport\
      \ and care to address their behavioral \nhealth crisis needs and to support\
      \ crisis resolution \nand connection to appropriate levels of care \nand follow-up.\
      \ Ideally every community should \nhave a wide range of these settings. Emergency\
      \ \nand crisis stabilization services are designed to \nameliorate the behavioral\
      \ health crisis and reduce \nacute symptoms while identifying and connecting\
      \ \nindividuals to supports that foster sustaining \nthese gains as well as\
      \ longer-term goals. These \nservices are resiliency- and recovery-focused,\
      \ \ntrauma-informed, and offer both observation and \ntherapeutic support.\n\
      Emergency and crisis stabilization services provide \naccess to mental health\
      \ and substance use care \nand are delivered to individuals of varying ages,\
      \ \nclinical conditions, and levels of acuity. In this \nsection, emergency\
      \ and crisis stabilization services \nare described based on their functions:\
      \ crisis \nstabilization services (no- or low-barrier) and crisis \nresidential\
      \ services (referral-based). SAMHSA is \nhopeful that the emerging crisis continuum\
      \ will \ninform future editions of both the LOCUS Family of \nTools and ASAM,\
      \ so that these criteria all evolve \ntogether in providing consistent information\
      \ for the \nbehavioral health field.\nWhile specific child, youth, and family\
      \ models are \nnoted in the following, all systems should have the \nability\
      \ to serve people across the lifespan.\nNo-Barrier or Low-Barrier Crisis \n\
      Stabilization Services\nCrisis stabilization services provide no-barrier \n\
      or low-barrier access points for adults and \nyouth experiencing a range of\
      \ behavioral health \nemergencies and crises. Short-term crisis \nstabilization\
      \ services (typically providing care for \nunder 24 hours with extension capabilities)\
      \ offer \nopportunities for diversion from law enforcement \nand other first\
      \ responder interventions, especially \nwhen there is no barrier to entry for\
      \ individuals \nwho have behavioral health emergencies. Crisis \nstabilization\
      \ services focus on initial response, \ntriage, screening, assessment, and intervention\
      \ \nto rapidly address the needs of the person in \ncrisis and promote de-escalation\
      \ and stabilization. \nWithout no-barrier services that support individuals\
      \ \nwho are experiencing highly acute behavioral \nhealth emergencies without\
      \ admissions criteria, \nSAMHSA’s vision to divert as many individuals as \n\
      possible away from EDs and jails for their urgent \nand emergent behavioral\
      \ health needs cannot \ntruly be achieved. No-barrier services also serve \n\
      an important function in supporting behavioral \nhealth equity in crisis care\
      \ as this can mitigate bias \nin screening and referrals. Finally, these no-\
      \ and \nlow-barrier services are well-suited to be paired \nwith other crisis\
      \ stabilization services so that \nindividuals and providers have options about\
      \ the \nsetting whereby they receive their care. This can \nalso minimize any\
      \ associated stigma surrounding \nmore secure settings and support obtaining\
      \ care in \nthe least restrictive environment.\n47\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor\

      \ in this section is presented according \nto the following categories: crisis\
      \ stabilization \nservices, crisis residential programs, BHUC, peer \ncrisis\
      \ respite, and sobering centers.\nCrisis Stabilization Services\nResearch on\
      \ emergency stabilization centers, also \nknown as crisis stabilization facilities,\
      \ indicates \nthat many individuals assessed for hospitalization \ncan instead\
      \ receive safe and effective care in \nthese crisis settings. The outcomes for\
      \ individuals \nreceiving these services are as strong as or better \nthan hospital\
      \ care and the cost of these services \nis substantially less than the costs\
      \ of inpatient \ncare.96,97 Emergency stabilization models such \nas EmPATH\
      \ have been shown to reduce wait \ntimes, psychiatric hospital admissions, and\
      \ return \nof individuals to the ED within 30 days.98,99,100 \nEmPATH units\
      \ also have demonstrated that they \nare beneficial in establishing post-ED\
      \ follow-up \ncare and are effective in rural communities.101\nIn addition,\
      \ research has found that individuals \nwho receive crisis services prefer going\
      \ to a safe \nplace, receiving services from peers and trained \nbehavioral\
      \ health professionals, and interacting \nwith people who offer respect and\
      \ dignity to them \nas individuals – experiences that they report not \nhaving\
      \ in the hospital setting.102 Emergency and \ncrisis stabilization services\
      \ can help fulfill these \nneeds and provide timely services to address and\
      \ \nresolve behavioral health crises.\nCrisis Residential Programs\nThe findings\
      \ from the research on crisis residential \nprograms are similar to those of\
      \ crisis stabilization \nservices for the specific populations that were \n\
      served by these programs: the outcomes for \nindividuals receiving these services\
      \ are as strong \nas those for hospital-based care, and the costs \nof residential\
      \ programs are significantly less than \nhospital-based services.103,104,105\
      \ A study by \nHawthorne et al. compared participant outcomes \nfor acute short-term\
      \ residential programs to those \nof acute psychiatric hospital settings and\
      \ found \nthat individuals with similar levels of psychiatric \ndistress at\
      \ admission had similar improvements \nin symptoms and functioning at discharge.106\
      \ \nIn addition, participant satisfaction was similar \nbetween the two settings.\
      \ The cost of treatment \nfor the short-term residential programs was much \n\
      lower than the cost for the acute psychiatric \nhospital settings.107 In one\
      \ study, Veterans \nfavored acute short-term residential treatment \nenvironments\
      \ over hospital-based settings, \nproviding evidence of the important role of\
      \ these \nservices as alternatives to acute psychiatric \nhospital settings.108,109\n\
      BHUC\nThe evidence related to BHUC demonstrates that \nthis service increases\
      \ access to care, decreases \nwait times for services, reduces ED visits, and\
      \ \ncosts less than ED visits.110,111,112 One challenge \nrelated to BHUC centers\
      \ is that more than half of \nthem are located in higher-income communities,\
      \ \nwhich could limit access for lower-income help \nseekers.113 A benefit of\
      \ BHUC is help seekers can \nobtain access to a psychiatric care in person or\
      \ \nthrough telehealth and avoid lengthy wait times \nthat exist in many behavioral\
      \ health systems.114 \nAdditional research is needed on outcomes after \nindividuals\
      \ receive services from BHUC centers.\nPeer Respite\nThe available research\
      \ on peer crisis respite \noutcomes shows that peer crisis respite services\
      \ \nare associated with improved self-esteem, mental \nhealth symptoms, and\
      \ social functioning.115,116 \nPeer respite services also are associated with\
      \ \ndecreased use of inpatient or ED services and \nincreases in guest satisfaction.117\
      \ In a study by \nCroft and Isvan, individuals using peer crisis \nrespite services\
      \ were 70 percent less likely to \n53\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral\

      \ 23-Hour Urgent Crisis \nCenter for Children\nThe Connecticut Department of\
      \ Children and \nFamilies established community-based Urgent \nCrisis Centers\
      \ (UCC) for youth in 2023 as an \nalternative to EDs for families facing behavioral\
      \ \nhealth crises. These licensed outpatient walk-in \nclinics provide immediate\
      \ resources for youth \nexperiencing issues like suicidal thoughts, anxiety,\
      \ \nor substance misuse, allowing stays of up to 23 \nhours. Core services include\
      \ nursing evaluations, \nclinical crisis stabilization, and additional ongoing\
      \ \nsupport. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2024, \n322 youth were treated\
      \ at the UCCs, with 99 \npercent meeting treatment goals and 96 percent \ndischarged\
      \ to their homes, with an average length \nof stay was 3.5 hours.\nMore Information\n\
      \ • Connecticut State Department of Children and \nFamilies, Urgent Crisis Centers\
      \ for Children\nrequire inpatient care or visit EDs compared to \nthose who\
      \ did not use respite services.118 For \nthose peer crisis respite service guests\
      \ who did \nseek inpatient or emergency care, spending more \ndays in respite\
      \ was linked to fewer hours spent \nin those services – however, this connection\
      \ was \nminimal for respite stays that lasted longer than \n14 days.119 The\
      \ evidence also demonstrates that \npeer crisis respite services are far less\
      \ costly than \ninpatient or ED crisis services.120 One study of \npeer crisis\
      \ respite programs in New York City found \nthat these programs resulted in\
      \ decreased rates of \nhospitalization for Medicaid recipients and fewer \n\
      Medicaid health expenditures for peer crisis respite \nparticipants versus a\
      \ comparison group.121\nSobering Centers\nResearch related to sobering centers\
      \ demonstrates \nthat they are effective for stabilizing adults with \nacute\
      \ alcohol and/or other drug intoxication \nand that they are less costly alternatives\
      \ to EDs \nand jails.122,123,124,125 One study of the utility of \nsobering\
      \ centers in five U.S. jurisdictions found \nthat sobering centers are beneficial\
      \ alternatives \nto arrest, particularly for unhoused persons to \ndivert them\
      \ from the criminal justice system.126 \nA 2019 study of the cost impact of\
      \ sobering centers \nrevealed that the use of sobering centers instead \nof\
      \ the ED for individuals with uncomplicated acute \nintoxication could result\
      \ in significant savings \nfor the nation’s healthcare system.127 A 2021 \n\
      literature review on sobering centers, EDs, \nand EMS recommended additional\
      \ research to \nidentify protocols for EMS to assess and transfer \nindividuals\
      \ to the most appropriate service \nlocation.128\nEmergency and Crisis Stabilization\
      \ \nfor Children and Youth\nFor children, youth, and families, a strong crisis\
      \ \nresponse system will require policies and practices \nthat are aligned with\
      \ SAMHSA’s System of Care \nvalues, including family-driven, youth-driven, \n\
      trauma-informed, and culturally and linguistically \nresponsive care.129 The\
      \ crisis response system \nis one of many systems that serve youth with \nbehavioral\
      \ health needs. Operating within a system \nof care framework is key to understanding\
      \ how \nyouth and families access services, identifying \nsystem gaps, and ensuring\
      \ coordination among \nall the systems that serve youth (e.g., schools, \nprimary\
      \ care, children’s behavioral health, child \nwelfare, juvenile justice).130\n\
      As described in SAMHSA’s National Guidelines \nfor Child and Youth Behavioral\
      \ Health Crisis Care \n(PDF) (2022), and also in these 2025 National \nCrisis\
      \ Guidelines, youth crisis services are focused \non de-escalation and stabilization\

      \ communities. Services \ntypically begin with an initial crisis response by\
      \ \nan MCT but also could be initiated following a \ncrisis facility contact\
      \ or as a transition from a \nhigher level of care such as inpatient psychiatric\
      \ \nhospitalization. Services often are provided for \nup to eight weeks and\
      \ may include direct support \nsuch as ongoing access, timely mobile response\
      \ \nservices, assistance with making environments \nsafe, peer and family support,\
      \ psychoeducation, \nbrief clinical interventions, skill building, and safety\
      \ \nmonitoring, as well as linkages to longer-term \nsupport and care. Services\
      \ should align with the \nunique strengths, needs, preferences, and cultural\
      \ \ncontexts of the youth or adult in crisis and their \nfamilies and other\
      \ supporters.\nIn-Home Stabilization Services\nIn-home stabilization services\
      \ may serve as a \nbridge that helps youth transition from immediate \ncrisis\
      \ services (e.g., mobile response, crisis \nfacilities) to ongoing care in the\
      \ community. \nIn-home stabilization services are provided as \nsoon as practicable\
      \ and may continue for several \nweeks. For example, in the MRSS model, in-home\
      \ \nstabilization services are provided for up to eight \nweeks, while other\
      \ models range from 6–16 \nweeks.132 Services may be provided by a therapist\
      \ \nor clinician in partnership with a paraprofessional \nwho can help youth\
      \ and families/natural supporters \nimplement the plan that they develop with\
      \ their \ntherapist.133,134 Examples of in-home services \ninclude assessment,\
      \ parent education programs, \npeer support, coping and conflict management\
      \ \nskills-building, behavior management training, and \nwarm hand-offs to other\
      \ resources and services. \nStabilization can also involve evidence-based \n\
      therapies for the young person and their family/\nnatural support providers,\
      \ such as Functional \nFamily Therapy, Trauma-Focused Cognitive \nBehavioral\
      \ Therapy, Multidimensional Family \nTherapy, or Multisystemic Therapy.135 Stabilization\
      \ \nproviders collaborate with the youth and family/\nsupports as active partners\
      \ to develop goals \nthat are integrated into a crisis plan of care. This \n\
      involves identifying unmet needs, communication \nchallenges, underlying concerns,\
      \ individual \nstrengths, and coping strategies. Importantly, \nservices are\
      \ provided to both the youth and their \nfamily/natural support providers. Too\
      \ often, families \nhave felt sidelined by service providers who \nfocus exclusively\
      \ on the young person, without \nsufficiently considering important family dynamics\
      \ \nor the supports that family members/natural \nsupport providers need.136\n\

      \ and Family Crisis Respite\nYouth and family crisis respite services provide\
      \ \nan alternative to hospitalization for youth \nexperiencing emotional crises\
      \ that are warm, \nsafe, and supportive home-like places to rest and \nrecover\
      \ when more support is needed than can be \nprovided at home. Youth and family\
      \ crisis respite \nservices are distinct from adult respite and crisis \nresidential\
      \ facilities and are tailored to prioritize \nfamily and natural supports. Services\
      \ are provided \nto both the youth and their family and are aligned \nwith the\
      \ System of Care values and principles. \nThese services are family-driven,\
      \ youth-driven, \ntrauma-informed, resiliency- and recovery-oriented, \nand\
      \ culturally and linguistically responsive.\nCrisis Stabilization Facilities\n\
      There are various types of crisis facilities designed \nto support youth with\
      \ more intensive care and \nsafety needs than can be provided through home \n\
      and community-based services. Examples include \ncrisis emergency and stabilization\
      \ centers, 23-hour \nbeds/observation units, respite care, walk-in \nservices,\
      \ and BHUC.137 Benefits include a safe \nenvironment and short-term care that\
      \ avoids \nhospitalization or that provides transition services \npost-hospitalization.\
      \ These services aim to facilitate \na swift return home and, when needed, a\
      \ transition \nto outpatient care.138\nResidential settings such as respite\
      \ care \nfacilities aim to prevent longer term out-of-home \nplacements and\
      \ alleviate family stress.139 Crisis \nstabilization facilities often have a\
      \ small number \nof chairs (e.g., 6–16), and they may operate in a \nresidential,\
      \ home-like setting.140 They generally \nimpose a maximum period of stay, ranging\
      \ from \nless than a day (23-hour units) up to two or \nthree weeks. Services\
      \ provided in these facilities \ninclude assessment, medication management,\
      \ \ncare coordination and service linkages, discharge \nplanning, and others.\
      \ Facilities are often staffed \nby peer support providers and other crisis\
      \ \nresponse paraprofessionals or professionals. \nIf needed, supervision and\
      \ medical consultation \nmay be provided by trained professionals such as \n\
      physicians or psychiatrists.141\nShort-Term Crisis Residential for Children\
      \ \nand Youth\nShort-term crisis residential centers offer short-\nterm out-of-home\
      \ placement for the child, allowing \nthe family to avert the need for psychiatric\
      \ inpatient \ntreatment or lengthy out-of-home placement. \nThe goal is to address\
      \ acute mental health \nneeds and coordinate a successful return to the \nfamily\
      \ at the earliest possible time, concomitant \nwith high-quality, home- and\
      \ community-based \nservices. During the time that the child is receiving \n\
      residential crisis stabilization, there is regular \ncontact between the team\
      \ and the family to \nprepare for the child’s return to the family.142\nCoordination\
      \ with Other Service \nComponents for Crisis Stabilization\nProviders of emergency\
      \ and crisis stabilization \nservices should coordinate with other sectors and\
      \ \nservice components to ensure safety, continuity of \ncare, and optimal outcomes\
      \ for adults and youth \nreceiving these services. Coordination of services\
      \ \nis an integral part of a robust BHCSCC.\nCoordination with 988 Lifeline,\
      \ Other \nBehavioral Health Crisis Lines, and MCTs\nPrior to using emergency\
      \ and crisis stabilization, \nmany individuals have interacted with other \n\
      BHCSCC services. As such, referrals or requests \nfor emergency and crisis stabilization\
      \ commonly \noriginate from the 988 Lifeline, other behavioral \nhealth crisis\
      \ lines, or MCTs. Clear communication \nmethods and coordination with these\

      \ \npermit law enforcement drop-off to ensure that \ntransfers are rapid and\
      \ person-centered and that \nthere are clear protocols to optimize collaboration.\
      \ \nRegular team meetings are recommended to build \nrelationships and trust,\

      \ care is important \nacross the full crisis services continuum, and it \nis\
      \ particularly crucial for emergency and crisis \nstabilization. Since these\
      \ services are typically \ntime-limited and facility-based, participants’ \n\
      continued progress is dependent on coordinated \nfollow-up care. Coordination\
      \ of emergency \nand crisis stabilization ensures that the proper \nreferrals\
      \ and warm hand-offs occur for adults and \nyouth discharging from services\
      \ and that they \nare connected to appropriate levels of care post-\ndischarge.\

      \ communities should ensure that \nindividuals have access to each of the three\
      \ \nessential elements of behavioral health crisis \ncare. In addition, providers,\
      \ system partners, and \npayers should collaborate to ensure coordination \n\
      of services and that system components are \naccountable for effective crisis\
      \ response in \ncommunities.143 Currently, this vision of crisis \nsystem collaboration\
      \ and coordination is not fully \nrealized in all communities, which leaves\
      \ some \nadults and youth without the support they need. \nBHCSCCs should serve\
      \ all members of the \ncommunity, address the diverse needs of various \npopulations,\
      \ and promote equitable access to \ncare. They also should have clear administrative\
      \ \nfunctions and oversight; policies and procedures \ndesigned to support goals\
      \ and objectives; detailed \nplans for communication and public engagement;\
      \ \nthe ability to use data and technology to assess \nand improve systems and\
      \ services; a strategy for \nlong-term financing and sustainability of services;\
      \ \nand supports in place for the behavioral health \ncrisis workforce. A well-developed\
      \ BHCSCC will \nbe able to respond to crises effectively as well \nas foster\
      \ resilience and well-being across the \ncommunities it serves.\nBHCSCC design,\
      \ implementation, and \nsustainability are dependent upon the following \nessential\
      \ infrastructure components:\n • Administrative Structure, Oversight, and Policy;\n\
      \ • Communications and Community Engagement;\n • Equitable Behavioral Health\

      \ Health Crisis Workforce \nRecruitment, Retention, and Support.\nAdministrative\
      \ Structure, Oversight, and Policy\nBHCSCCs require administrative structure,\

      \ including, but not limited \nto, decision making, financing, developing and/\n\
      or implementing regulations, and accountability. \nTogether, these structures\

      \ \namong state Medicaid agencies and Medicaid \nmanaged care plans, law enforcement,\
      \ EMS, \nhospitals, local agencies, behavioral health crisis \nproviders, and\
      \ individuals with lived experience. \nTherefore, states, local governments,\
      \ tribes and \ntribal organizations, territories, and jurisdictions \nmay choose\
      \ to designate their existing behavioral \nhealth system structures (e.g., local/regional\
      \ \nbehavioral health authorities, community service \nboards, county behavioral\
      \ health departments) \nto act as, or partner in the performance of the \nfunctions\
      \ of, the accountable entity.\nEssential Functions of Accountable Entities\n\
      Accountable entities are responsible for the \nfollowing essential functions\
      \ necessary for the \noperation and continuous quality improvement of \ncomprehensive\
      \ and equitable BHCSCCs:\n • Authority and Accountability: The \naccountable\
      \ entity should establish \nand communicate lines of authority and \naccountability\
      \ throughout the BHCSCC. Entities \nshould delineate the organizations and partners\
      \ \nresponsible for providing effective services \nthrough each of SAMHSA’s\
      \ three essential \nservice elements, who has authority or serves \nas lead\
      \ organization at different points in the \ncontinuum, and to define and lead\

      \ medical leadership to \nensure that systems are capable of supporting \npeople\
      \ with a range of medical and psychiatric \nconcerns.\n • Community Assessment\
      \ and Planning: \nAccountable entities should involve diverse \npartners in\
      \ the process of determining \ncommunity needs and plans to address them. \n\
      These partners include the broader behavioral \nhealth system, crisis partners\
      \ outside the \nbehavioral health system, peer and family-\nled organizations,\
      \ organizations that serve \nchildren and youth, public and private payers,\
      \ \nindividuals who have used the system and \ntheir families, tribes and tribal\
      \ organizations, \nand members of communities that have been \nhistorically\
      \ disenfranchised and underserved by \nthe crisis system. Accountable entities\
      \ should \nidentify the current need and forecast growth \nand a trajectory\
      \ for the BHCSCC through \ncommunity assessment and planning. They \nalso should\
      \ coordinate the multi-sector input \nfor the assessment and planning process,\
      \ map \ntheir BHCSCC, identify goals for the BHCSCC, \ndevelop specific action\
      \ steps, and facilitate \nthe ability for individuals and organizations to \n\
      be held accountable for completing steps in \nthe process.\n • Coordination\
      \ and Integration: Effective \ncoordination among crisis system partners \n\
      (e.g., EMS, law enforcement, hospitals/EDs, \nsocial services, schools, child\
      \ welfare) across \nthe state or local area is crucial to improve \nintegration\
      \ of services and systems, including \nimproved data sharing, resource connectivity,\

      \ \nto inform system gaps, service needs, and \nareas for improvement. System\
      \ mapping can \nbe similar to a systems-based approach of \nthe “air traffic\
      \ control” analogy noted in the \nNational Guidelines for Behavioral Health\
      \ \nCrisis Care: Best Practice Toolkit (PDF) \n(2020) at a population instead\
      \ of individual \nlevel. Additionally, accountable entities should \ndevelop\
      \ and maintain a well-structured \nemergency plan to ensure that there is no\
      \ \ndisruption of services during large scale \nemergencies, such as a natural\
      \ disaster or \nmass casualty event. These emergencies \nmay also indicate the\
      \ need for additional \ncrisis support due to the unique behavioral \nhealth\
      \ needs that may arise due to the nature \nof the event. These emergency plans\
      \ should \ninclude specific protocols and procedures for \ncollaborating with\
      \ Incident Command Systems \n(ICS) and working alongside federal agencies \n\
      that might be involved such as the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA)\
      \ \nand/or SAMHSA, as well as state emergency \nmanagement organizations and\
      \ local disaster \nresponse teams.\n • Financing: The accountable entity should\
      \ play \nan active role in coordinating funding streams \nfor crisis services\
      \ across funding sources \nand payer types, as well as provide input in \ncoordination\
      \ with states, tribes, territories, and \npayers into decisions related to the\
      \ funding \nand contracting of services and providers. \nThe entity also should\
      \ be able to identify and \nsupport the best payment mechanisms and \nmodels\
      \ to support income generation in the \nchallenges of the crisis setting. Medicaid\
      \ is \ngenerally the payer of last resort. Per federal \nregulations in 42 CFR\
      \ 433.51(c), federal funds \ngenerally may not be used as non-federal \nshare\
      \ to draw down additional federal matching \nfunds for Medicaid and the Children’s\
      \ Health \nInsurance Program (CHIP) expenditures. More \ndetails are provided\
      \ in the subsequent section \non Financing and Fiscal Sustainability.\n • Regulations:\
      \ Accountable entities should have \nthe authority to create, interpret, and\
      \ apply \nregulations to support effective behavioral \nhealth crisis management.\
      \ Entities should \nbalance the need for regulations to help ensure \ncomprehensive\
      \ and equitable services with the \nneed for flexibility to ensure that regulations\
      \ do \nnot pose unintentional barriers for individuals to \nreceive services.\
      \ One example of this is being \nprescriptive with how many or what type of\
      \ \nproviders can deliver specific types of services. \nRegulations should aim\
      \ to ensure adherence \nto evidence-informed practices and the \nentity’s established\
      \ standards across multiple \nsituations or settings.\n • Data, Evaluation,\
      \ and Quality Improvement: \nAccountable entities are responsible for data \n\
      collection, tracking, and sharing as well as \nevaluation of BHCSCCs and their\
      \ services. In \nthis role, accountable entities can:\n \n♦\nDevelop process\
      \ and outcome metrics for \nservices and system components.\n \n♦\nDevelop and\
      \ implement processes for \ndata collection systems, tracking data over \ntime,\
      \ data sharing, data use, and linking \nadministrative data.\n \n♦\nDevelop\
      \ and implement a standard about \nhow to use data for continuous quality \n\
      improvement for services and the system.\n61\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral\

      \ the Albuquerque \nCommunity Safety Department\nIn June 2020, the City of Albuquerque,\
      \ New \nMexico approved the creation of the Albuquerque \nCommunity Safety (ACS)\
      \ department started with \nthe singular probing, yet provocative question:\
      \ \n“What if every call for behavioral health support \nbrought care, not criminalization?”\
      \ Albuquerque \ncity officials subsequently formed the ACS \nPlanning Committee,\
      \ composed of key community \nleaders and experts, and engaged with local \n\
      communities to develop the ACS. They gathered \nfeedback through the ACS Community\
      \ Input \nSurvey, which received 2,858 responses and over \n1,000 public comments.\
      \ City leaders also hosted 7 \nvirtual events with more than 25 community partner\
      \ \ngroups and summarized the results in a January \n2021 Community Engagement\
      \ Report (PDF). \nThis feedback and report informed the strategic \ndirection\
      \ of the ACS which can be found in its \nDecember 2021 Organizational Plan (PDF).\n\
      Through this collaborative process, they have \nsince clarified their vision\
      \ to be a city where a \nperson can call for help and get a purposeful, \nhumane,\
      \ and appropriate response in order to “to \nprovide Albuquerque with a holistic,\
      \ empathetic, \nand informed response to behavioral and \nmental health-related\
      \ 911 calls.” Responses are \npersonalized to the needs of the individual, family,\
      \ \nand community so that ACS can bring the right \nresponse at the right time.\
      \ Among other milestones \nin their first year, they diverted their first 911\
      \ call \nand responded to over 16,000 calls in September \n2021. Through ongoing\
      \ implementation, they \nstrive to create a collaborative environment \nthat\

      \ effective response and facilitates \nongoing trust building with care providers\
      \ and \ncommunity members.\nThe engagement plan should be embedded in the \n\
      larger crisis care plan but also be able to serve as \na standalone process.\
      \ Communities should solicit \nand incorporate input from representatives of\

      \ are critical to ensuring \nthat a BHCSCC is firmly rooted in health equity:156\n\
      1. Culturally & Linguistically Appropriate \nServices: Providing culturally\
      \ and linguistically \nappropriate services helps reduce health \ninequities.\
      \ HHS developed national standards \nfor providing culturally and linguistically\
      \ \nappropriate services (CLAS)157 in health and \nhealth care. CLAS standards\
      \ aim to promote \nhealth equity, enhance quality, and reduce \nhealthcare disparities.\
      \ These include standards \nrelated to governance and leadership, \ncommunication\
      \ and language assistance, and \nengagement and continuous improvement. \nAdditionally,\
      \ these standards include culturally \nappropriate services for American Indian/\n\
      Alaska Native populations, such as traditional \npractices and training crisis\
      \ service providers \non the IHS and their local tribes.\n2. Representative\
      \ Behavioral Health \nCrisis Workforce: A representative crisis \nworkforce\
      \ fosters trust with individuals, \nenhances communication, and ultimately \n\
      leads to improved access to care and better \nhealth outcomes. This includes\
      \ individuals \nwith lived experience as well as other \ndemographic factors.\
      \ A study of clients with \nsevere and persistent mental illness from \ncommunity\
      \ mental health centers found that \nclients reported better recovery outcomes\
      \ \nwhen they were treated by an ethnically \nmatched individual.158\n3. Quality\
      \ Improvement & Accountability: \nMaintaining an effective, equity-centered,\
      \ crisis \nsystem requires a data-driven approach.159 \nMeaningful outcomes\
      \ to assess equity \nshould focus on linkage to care and symptom \nimprovement,\
      \ among other outcomes and \nimpacts, as opposed to strictly process \noutcomes\
      \ such as response times.\n66\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral Health\

      \ refers to a series \nof nonmedical factors and life experiences \nthat influence\
      \ health outcomes and \nhealth  equity. These include factors such as \nstable\
      \ housing, education, access to food, \naccess to transportation, adverse childhood\
      \ \nexperiences, and others. An individual’s SDOH \nhas been found to have a\
      \ significant influence \non their health outcomes. By recognizing and \naddressing\
      \ SDOH, providers can tailor care to \nmeet an individual’s specific needs.160\n\

      \ of their effectiveness in different \ncommunities and contexts.\nData metrics\
      \ for behavioral health crisis services \nshould be identified based on their\
      \ utility in \nsupporting continuous quality improvement \nefforts. Communities\
      \ should use data for early \nidentification of community service needs and\
      \ \ngaps, to develop an inventory of existing resources \nand assets, and to\
      \ guide system improvement. \nCommunities should select and apply an evaluation\
      \ \nframework that will help achieve evaluation goals \nand provide results\
      \ that can inform evidence-\nbased decision-making. In addition to identifying\
      \ \nlocal capacity and need, long-term outcomes and \nimpacts should focus on\
      \ the extent to which efforts \ncontribute to the quintuple aim for health care\

      \ implications on the crisis workforce, \nand the impact on advancing health\
      \ equity for \nmarginalized communities.\nStandardized definitions are essential.\
      \ It is \nimportant for there to be alignment both on how \nservices are defined,\
      \ and on the key operational \nand quality metrics that can support performance\
      \ \nmonitoring and evaluation of services. Introducing \nvariability into data\
      \ definitions and standards \ncreates barriers to making cross-site comparisons\
      \ \nor to evaluating the system in its entirety at the \nnational level. In\
      \ 2022, SAMHSA published \nTelling the Story: Data, Dashboards, and the \nMental\
      \ Health Crisis Continuum, which assesses \nthe current state around data collection\
      \ and \nprovides examples of potential measures.\nGuiding Principles\nCrisis\
      \ services in behavioral health rely on \nstrong ethical and practice standards.\
      \ Thorough, \nmethodological evaluations and data collection \napproaches are\
      \ crucial for improving public health \nactions. These evaluations should be\
      \ useful, \nrealistic, ethical, and accurate. To achieve this, \nevaluators\
      \ should use the scientific method and \nhave proper training to ensure their\
      \ findings are \ncredible and trustworthy. Stakeholder involvement \nis vital\
      \ at every stage of the evaluation process, \nincluding conceptualizing the\
      \ evaluation and \nselecting the approach.\nIn addition, evaluation data collection\
      \ efforts \nshould address health equity and seek to \nunderstand the broader\
      \ context in which services \nare provided. This includes assessing both the\
      \ \nintended outcomes of crisis services and any \nunexpected effects. It should\
      \ involve input from \npartners, including those with lived experience, \nto\
      \ ensure that the information is relevant and \nuseful. This approach leads\
      \ to better service \ndelivery and improved health outcomes for \ndiverse communities.\n\
      Transparency is also an important consideration; \nevaluators should identify\
      \ the needs of service \nusers early in the process and encourage open \ncommunication.\
      \ When reporting results, it is \nessential to present a full picture, including\
      \ positive \nand negative findings, while being clear about any \nconflicts\
      \ of interest.\nSteps in Evaluation\nThe six connected steps of the framework\
      \ \nprovide a starting point to tailor an evaluation for \na particular program,\
      \ at a particular point in time. \nThe steps are as follows:162\n • Assess the\
      \ context.\n • Describe the program.\n • Focus the evaluation question design.\n\
      \ • Gather credible evidence.\n • Generate and support conclusions.\n • Act\
      \ on findings.\nLogic Models\nLogic models are visual representations of the\
      \ \nrelationships among system or program inputs, \nactivities, outputs, outcomes,\
      \ and impacts.163 \nThey communicate the purpose of the system or \nprogram,\
      \ who the contributors and partners are, \nthe desired outcomes and impacts,\
      \ and the specific \nmechanisms by which the goals will be achieved.\nEvaluation\
      \ of the BHCSCC and crisis services \nshould begin with a logic model to provide\
      \ a visual \noverview of the system or program depicting \nits resources, planned\
      \ activities, and intended \noutcomes. This provides an invaluable resource\
      \ \nto which leaders and evaluators can refer \nduring implementation and continuous\
      \ quality \nimprovement.164\n68\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral Health\

      \ Governance\nData governance refers to the necessary \nframeworks, policies,\
      \ and protocols developed by \nan agency or organization to manage all aspects\
      \ of \ndata collection.165 Evaluation data collection should \nbe anchored by\
      \ a detailed data governance plan \nthat should account for the following aspects:166\n\
      \ • Data Quality: Processes to ensure data is \ncollected in an accurate and\
      \ uniform manner.\n • Data Security: Protocols in place to ensure \ndata will\
      \ be protected and only accessed by \nauthorized individuals, including the\
      \ handling of \nprotected health information (PHI). Additionally, \nall data\
      \ collection programs and protocols \nshould respect Tribal Data Sovereignty.167\n\
      \ • Data Sharing/Transparency: List of \naudiences for each type of data and\
      \ necessary \nconsiderations for each, processes and \nmechanisms for data sharing\
      \ and data access, \nas well as routine measures in place to \nensure data collection\
      \ efforts are known and \naccessible to all relevant partners/community \nmembers.\
      \ This may include data type, \nstandards, and access/reuse considerations.168\n\
      \ • Data Integration: List of any external data \nsources and processes for\
      \ data aggregation \nand usability.\n • Compliance: List of any legal/regulatory\
      \ \nrequirements pertinent to data collection, \nstorage, and sharing, and the\
      \ measures taken \nto meet these requirements.\nBy maintaining an effective\
      \ data governance plan, \nBHCSCCs can ensure transparent, effective, and \n\
      safe data collection, sharing, and storage.\nQuality Improvement\nIn addition\
      \ to collecting data on program outcomes \nand impact, a key application of\
      \ data in a BHCSCC \nis to drive continuous quality improvement. This \ninvolves\
      \ collecting and analyzing data to pinpoint \nboth strengths and weaknesses\
      \ within services \nand operations, allowing for real-time corrections. \nQuality\
      \ improvement evaluation processes should \ninclude the collection of both quantitative\
      \ and \nqualitative data. In addition, it is important to \nassess how processes\
      \ and procedures affect the \noverall BHCSCC and critical partners, including\
      \ \nindividuals with lived experience, crisis services \nworkers across the\
      \ three essential elements, EDs, \nlaw enforcement, and others.\nData and Evaluation\
      \ \nWorkforce Challenges\nA significant challenge to evaluation and data \n\
      collection efforts is the lack of funding to hire \ntrained evaluators and facilitate\
      \ effective data \nmanagement. This can lead to an absence of \nevaluation and\
      \ data collection efforts. Alternatively, \nusing individuals who lack sufficient\
      \ expertise could \nlead to efforts that are not rooted in evidence-\nbased\
      \ practices or that render inaccurate or \nincomplete data, all of which could\
      \ contribute \nto programmatic decisions and management \npractices that are\
      \ inconsistent with accurate \nevidence. Some agencies and organizations \n\
      address this workforce challenge by partnering with \nlocal universities, which\
      \ can offer expertise in data \ncollection and provide the necessary infrastructure.\
      \ \nThese partnerships can help ensure that data are \ncollected, managed, and\
      \ analyzed in accordance \nwith evaluation best practices and that data and\
      \ \nevaluation results are made accessible to all \nparticipating entities.\n\

      Optimizing Crisis Systems Through Technology\nTechnology enhances communication\
      \ and \ncoordination in the delivery of behavioral health \ncrisis services.\
      \ Technology, such as GPS-enabled \nmobile team services, real-time bed registry\
      \ and \ncoordination, centralized outpatient appointment \nscheduling, electronic\
      \ health record integration with \npartner services and health information exchange\
      \ \nnetworks, and the use of artificial intelligence in \nresponder training\
      \ and evaluation, all play an \nimportant role in expanding access to high-quality\
      \ \ncrisis care.172\nThis section discusses the use of technology to \nenhance\

      \ without having to spend hours and possibly \nmoney on transportation to a\
      \ health facility outside \nof their community and away from their support \n\
      network. It is important to note that broadband \naccess can be a barrier to\
      \ the utilization of this \nmodality in some communities as well as other \n\
      potential technological hurdles. These concerns \noffer the opportunity for\
      \ problem-solving and \nadvocacy to ensure that this resource is available \n\
      as broadly as possible.\nTelehealth offers the opportunity to connect \nsomeone\
      \ in crisis who is unable to receive in-\nperson care to virtual assessment\
      \ and clinical \nservices. When in-person care is far away or not \npossible,\
      \ telehealth can prevent tragedies and \nreduce the time for someone in crisis\
      \ to receive \nservices. Additionally, the use of telehealth \nprovides for\
      \ the expanded reach of services due \nto a limited licensed and/or otherwise\
      \ credentialed \nworkforce. Telehealth also can be a useful modality \nfor follow-up\
      \ crisis services. If an individual is \nleaving a crisis stabilization facility\
      \ or an inpatient \nsetting, the availability of telehealth follow-up care \n\
      can reduce the chance of a return visit to the ED \nor hospital. Follow-up care\
      \ through telehealth is \nvaluable in rural, remote, and tribal areas where\
      \ it \nmay not be feasible for someone to travel regularly \nto a follow-up\
      \ services provider.176\nPrivacy and Security Considerations\nPrivacy Expectations\n\
      For help seekers to trust responders during a \nbehavioral health crisis, they\
      \ should be able \nto understand the privacy framework for the \nhelp they are\
      \ seeking. This means translating \nexpectations and legal requirements around\
      \ \nprivacy and confidentiality into plain language \nwith transparency so that\
      \ everyone understands \nprivacy protections.\nRegarding the sharing of user\
      \ data through 988, \nSAMHSA’s 988 Quality and Services Plan specifies \nexpectations\
      \ and requirements related to data \nfrom help seekers. This requirement is\
      \ not only for \n988 crisis centers but also for states developing \ntheir own\
      \ platforms to handle 988 calls to ensure \na baseline of privacy expectations\
      \ regardless of \nwhich center an individual contacts.\nThe expectations for\
      \ privacy include requirements \nthat contact centers will keep confidential\
      \ any \nhelp seeker’s personal information and that this \ninformation will\
      \ not be used, communicated, \ndisclosed, or disseminated, except in limited\
      \ \ncircumstances, such as cases of imminent \nrisk or situations required by\
      \ applicable law or \njudicial mandate.\nCrisis providers should familiarize\
      \ themselves \nwith the federal, state, territory and tribal laws \nthat pertain\
      \ to their organization to ensure that \npolicies and practices are consistent\
      \ with these \nlaws and regulations, and that there is clarity for \nthe public\
      \ on how these policies impact the person \nseeking help.\nCybersecurity Considerations\n\
      Behavioral health providers should increase their \nfocus on cybersecurity throughout\
      \ the BHCSCC, \nespecially as systems are being linked and \nconnected in new\
      \ ways, which puts personal \ndata more at risk with increased vulnerable entry\
      \ \npoints. Everyone working on related systems \nand platforms should ensure\
      \ cybersecurity \nstandards and protections are in place that will \nprotect\
      \ crisis-related infrastructure and user \ninformation. Policymakers and providers\
      \ should \nensure that they collect only the data necessary, \nanonymize whenever\
      \ possible, and implement \nsecurity measures.\n72\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor\

      \ Crisis Line (VCL) \nSimulated Training for Responders \nUsing AI Personas\n\
      In 2023, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) revealed the winners\
      \ of a $20 million \nchallenge to reduce Veteran suicide. One of the \nwinners\
      \ was ReflexAI, an AI-powered tool that can \nhelp the VCL train counselors\
      \ to meet the needs \nof their help seekers. ReflexAI uses an AI program \n\
      for simulated crisis line scenarios to train cohorts of \nnew counselors starting\
      \ with the VCL. Even though \nVCL responders are already trained in other ways,\
      \ \nthese adjunctive tools provide additional skills and \nresources to responders.\
      \ ReflexAI is a training tool \nonly; it is never used directly to communicate\
      \ with \nVeterans, service members, or those calling about \na Veteran or service\
      \ member.\nMore Information\n • Fierce Healthcare, VA Announces 10 winners in\
      \ \n$20M Challenge to Reduce Veteran Suicide\nSAMHSA’s 988 Cybersecurity Requirements\n\
      In SAMHSA’s Saving Lives in America: 988 Quality \nand Services Plan (PDF),\
      \ SAMHSA specified \n19 requirements as a minimum baseline for \nall of the\
      \ 988 crisis contact centers and states \ndeveloping centralized platforms.177\
      \ Examples of \nrequirements include the following:\n • Ensuring that systems\
      \ and centers have formal \ninformation security and privacy policies, \nbusiness\
      \ continuity analysis, and incident \nresponse plans;\n • Systems are monitored\
      \ and tested to ensure \nprivacy controls are operating as intended;\n • User\
      \ information and data are protected \nthrough encryption, multi-factor authentication,\
      \ \ninventories of asset management, and records \nmanagement; and\n • Potential\
      \ vulnerabilities are minimized to the \nextent possible by testing backup solutions,\
      \ \nstanding up a web application firewall, \nreviewing third party software\
      \ for risk, and \nusing automated tools to manage system \nvulnerabilities in\
      \ a timely manner.\nCrisis contact centers employ voice over internet \nprotocol\
      \ (VoIP), wireless, and computerized voice \nsystems that introduce new vectors\
      \ for bad actors, \nare susceptible to multiple distributed attacks with \n\
      greater automation from a broader geography, and \nuse computers and software\
      \ applications that are \nvulnerable to malware and ransomware attacks. \nThe\
      \ level of diligence should increase across the \nspace to ensure the protection\
      \ of behavioral health \ncrisis services and the information of the people \n\
      who use them.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nAI capabilities can improve the\
      \ quality of \nthe behavioral health crisis care through \ntraining stimulations\
      \ and evaluation of contact \nconversations to offer counselors immediate \n\
      feedback on how they can improve. AI solutions \ncan involve the processing\
      \ of confidential data; \ntherefore, it is critical that AI vendors adhere to\
      \ \ndata security and privacy regulations, especially \naround sensitive healthcare\
      \ data, and provide \ndocumentation around security practices. In \naddition,\

      \ health crisis is a profound human \nexperience and one that AI inherently\
      \ cannot \nhave. Mental health systems have increasingly \nrecognized the value\
      \ of lived experience. Any \nhuman behavioral health crisis services provider,\
      \ \nregardless of their experience with mental illness, \nhas more shared experience\
      \ with a person \naccessing care than AI, which has none. In \naddition, for\
      \ crisis contact centers, there is a risk to \nhaving AI respond to crisis contacts\
      \ because there \nis no human to monitor and adjust the AI response \nif necessary.\
      \ For these reasons and the risks of \nbias, misinterpretation, and potential\
      \ for harm to \nhelp seeker, the American Counseling Association \nhas recommended\
      \ that AI should not be used for \ndirect crisis response.178\nThe potential\
      \ for bias in AI tools for mental health \nis a concern, as it can impact the\
      \ accuracy and \nfairness of the results and AI already has known \nbiases.179\
      \ Bias can emerge when AI is trained on \ndata not representative of the broader\
      \ population, \nleading to AI amplifying these biases. For instance, \nif AI\
      \ is trained on data featuring individuals from \na specific group, the algorithm\
      \ may not be as \neffective in identifying mental health issues in \npeople\
      \ from other groups. To mitigate this, it is \nessential to develop AI algorithms\
      \ using diverse \ndatasets that account for various demographic \nfactors, such\
      \ as race, age, sex, ethnicity, and \nsocioeconomic status.180\nIn addition,\
      \ the pace of AI may outstrip existing \nregulatory frameworks. Clear policy\
      \ and guidance \nare needed to make sure the benefits of AI can \nbe adopted\
      \ broadly while minimizing the dangers \nit presents. For these reasons, it\
      \ is important that \norganizations that interface with AI technology in \n\
      behavioral health services continuously monitor the \nquality, efficacy, accuracy,\
      \ and fairness of the AI \nalgorithms to ensure that they are providing value\
      \ \nand do not perpetuate biases, misinformation, or \ncreate harms.181\nFinancing\
      \ and Fiscal Sustainability\nOverall Strategic Considerations\nThe overall financing\
      \ strategy for behavioral health \ncrisis services should be aligned with SAMHSA’s\
      \ \nvision for crisis care that is fully coordinated and \nintegrated and provides\
      \ the necessary emergency \ncapable services that offer health first responses\
      \ \nand reduce law enforcement response and ED \nusage. In this strategy, every\
      \ partner has a role, \nincluding federal, tribal, and local governments \n\
      and payers, among others. Developing a \nBHCSCC with a full continuum of services\
      \ for all \nages that corresponds with this vision requires \ninvestment at\
      \ all levels—federal, state, tribal, \nand local. This investment is critical\
      \ because \nan effective BHCSCC serves everyone, saves \nlives, and creates\
      \ healthier communities, just as \nother essential services such as police,\
      \ fire, and \nEMS do.\nSuccessful financing requires attention to the \nfinancial\
      \ needs associated with start-up and capital \ninvestments, as well as sustainability\
      \ and ongoing \noperational support, maintenance, and upgrades.\nSAMHSA’s vision\
      \ is that everyone will be able \nto access all types of behavioral health crisis\
      \ \nservices regardless of their ability to pay. In the \ncurrent environment,\
      \ essential behavioral health \ncrisis services often lack adequate coverage\
      \ and \nfunding, and help seekers sometimes are unable \nto participate in services\
      \ due to inability to pay. \nAlthough insurance may cover professional fees\

      \ routine visits, insurance typically does not \npay for the infrastructure\
      \ needed to maintain a \nresponsive BHCSCC. In addition, funding for \nbehavioral\
      \ health crisis services differs significantly \nacross states, tribes, and\
      \ territories. Often \nthese funds are pieced together, lack consistent \nsupport,\
      \ and are not aligned with financing best \npractices. Funding challenges are\
      \ exacerbated by \nvarying expectations regarding service delivery \nby crisis\
      \ providers and payers, which results in \na wide variety of misaligned and\
      \ uncoordinated \nfinancing methods.182\nThe financial infrastructure for a\
      \ Firehouse model \nprovides a useful framework for this vision of \nbehavioral\
      \ health crisis services. The aspiration \nof the Firehouse model is to align\
      \ behavioral \nhealth crisis services payment with that of existing \npublic\
      \ safety services (e.g., EMS, fire, police). \nThis requires the crisis system\
      \ to be funded \naround 24-hour capacity and access, in a way \nthat is commensurate\
      \ with the needs and size \nof the local community. With this approach, help\
      \ \nseekers define their own emergencies and can \nexpect to receive a prompt\
      \ and thorough response \nregardless of insurance or diagnosis.183 In \naddition,\
      \ these services should be available even \nwhen they are not needed, making\
      \ investment \nin infrastructure a key component. This vision \nincludes recognition\
      \ of the training and credentials \nnecessary to deliver emergency care across\
      \ the \ncontinuum. People generally do not question \nfees to support 911 services\
      \ because they value \nand expect those services to be available when \nthey\
      \ need them. Though it is admittedly a shift \nto think of behavioral health\
      \ crisis care in the \nsame way, SAMHSA’s vision is that communities \nwill\
      \ increasingly see the value that sustaining \nhealth first responses for behavioral\
      \ health crises \nprovides. Funding crisis care as an essential public \nhealth\
      \ service using a Firehouse model may be \nan effective strategy in order to\
      \ ensure that crisis \ncare is widely available to “anyone, anywhere \nand at\
      \ anytime”184 in a manner that is consistent \nwith public safety services.\
      \ Braiding and blending \nof funding and examining any relevant parallels \n\
      and opportunities to create equitable access to \ncrisis services as comparable\
      \ to physical health \nservices are additional opportunities to continue to\
      \ \ngrow a robust crisis continuum. Utilization of such \nan approach could\
      \ create sustainable funding for \ncrisis services, reduce overall healthcare\
      \ costs, \nand improve crisis response experiences and \noutcomes for individuals\
      \ in crisis.\nAdditional lessons and direction can be gleaned \nfrom recent\
      \ DOJ settlements that have addressed \ncivil rights issues and required jurisdictions\
      \ \nto build crisis systems that do not rely on law \nenforcement. For example,\
      \ a recent settlement \nin Louisville, Kentucky, found that the Louisville \n\
      Metro Government and the Louisville Metro \nPolice Department discriminated\
      \ against \npeople with behavioral health disabilities when \nresponding to\
      \ them in crisis.185 The findings report \nincluded several recommended remediation\
      \ \nsteps, including:\n • Expand the reach and capacity of the MCT \npilot program\
      \ and transition to a behavioral \nhealth-led response to people experiencing\
      \ a \nbehavioral health crisis, and\n • Improve coordination between Louisville’s\
      \ 911 \ncommunications center and crisis hotline to \nfacilitate mobile crisis\
      \ response.\nSuch investigations and recommendations serve \nto advance the\
      \ mandate around improved crisis \nsystem infrastructure.\nTo inform local decision\
      \ making, the National \nAssociation of Counties (NACo) and the National \n\
      Association of County Behavioral Health and \nDevelopmental Disability Directors\

      \ CCBHC PPS\nOklahoma has developed a statewide CCBHC \nprogram which has transformed\
      \ outpatient mental \nhealth and substance use care delivery, including \nthe\
      \ crisis response. Under the CCBHC model, \nOklahoma reimburses CCBHCs using\
      \ a per \nperson cost-based prospective payment system \nfor Medicaid eligible\
      \ individuals which covers a \ncomprehensive package of services, including\
      \ \nmobile crisis and other crisis services. This \nallows Oklahoma the flexibility\
      \ to tailor delivery \nof crisis response and include innovations, such \nas\
      \ remote access to mental health professionals \nthrough iPads in police patrol\
      \ cars, as a part of \ntheir CCBHC funding. Oklahoma requires that \nCCBHCs\
      \ have crisis services available 24/7/365 \nand that they must be able to provide\
      \ a mobile \ncrisis response within 1 hour for urban areas and 2 \nhours for\
      \ rural areas from the time the services are \nrequested. They must also make\
      \ available either \ndirectly, or through an agreement, facility-based \ncrisis\
      \ stabilization, urgent recovery clinics, and \noutpatient substance withdrawal\
      \ management.\nMore Information\n • Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and\
      \ \nSubstance Abuse Services, CCBHC\nfederal, state, and county governments\
      \ and non-\ngovernment sectors.186 Counties can use a variety \nof these resources\
      \ to build robust, accessible, and \nsustainable behavioral health BHCSCCs.\
      \ Different \nfunding approaches also can be leveraged to \naddress SDOH and\
      \ upstream and downstream \nfactors that intersect with the crisis experience.\n\
      There is significant momentum both at the federal \nand state levels, where\
      \ there are emerging \nstrategies (and multiple tactical efforts) to move \n\
      toward financing a crisis system everywhere. \nFederal legislation for CCBHCs,\
      \ direction from \nCMS to improve Medicare funding of the crisis \ncontinuum,\
      \ efforts to better define the elements \nof the crisis system, plus existing\
      \ Medicaid \nflexibilities, emerging local tax levies, Medicaid \nwaivers and\
      \ other flexibilities, and state legislation \nmandating insurance companies\
      \ to cover these \nservices are among the many examples. Every \ncommunity in\
      \ every state should be on this path.\nInnovative Financing Models\nStates and\
      \ other entities are implementing \ninnovative financing models to fund BHCSCCs\
      \ \nand behavioral health crisis services. Models with \npotential to improve\
      \ availability of crisis services \ninclude value-based care arrangements, bundling\
      \ \nfor crisis episodes using the Diagnostic Related \nGroup model or other\
      \ mechanisms, and risk \nadjustment models such as the Patient Driven \nPayment\
      \ Methodology utilized in nursing facilities, \nwhich provides acuity adjustments\
      \ based upon the \nexpected needs of the individual. As states, local \ngovernments,\
      \ tribes, territories, and jurisdictions \ncontinue to implement BHCSCCs, new\
      \ innovative \nfunding and sustainability models will continue \nto emerge.\n\
      One excellent example of a comprehensive \nfinancing strategy is the CCBHC model.\
      \ SAMHSA’s \nvision is for continued growth of CCBHCs across \nthe United States.\
      \ CCBHCs are designed to \nprovide comprehensive, coordinated care for \nmental\
      \ health and substance use conditions that is \ntrauma-informed and recovery-oriented.\
      \ CCBHCs \nmust provide nine required services including \nmobile crisis services,\
      \ must have walk-in crisis \nstabilization capacity during extended business\
      \ \nhours, and are required to coordinate with local \ncrisis systems. CCBHC\
      \ services should be tailored \nto meet the individual needs of their communities\
      \ \nand must be provided in a timely way to anyone \nwho expresses a need for\

      \ entities including regional \n988 crisis contact centers. In addition to providing\
      \ \ncrisis services, CCBHCs are well positioned to \nprovide care following\
      \ a crisis because of the \nCCBHC access and comprehensive service \nrequirements.\n\
      CCBHCs are supported through Medicaid as \nwell as through SAMHSA CCBHC expansion\
      \ \ngrants. CCBHCs must be certified by their state as \nmeeting federal standards\
      \ (CCBHC Certification \nCriteria)187 as a part of a state CCBHC program \n\
      or have submitted an attestation to meeting these \nstandards to SAMHSA as a\
      \ part of participation in \nthe SAMHSA CCBHC Expansion grant program. \nThere\
      \ are two tracks in the CCBHC Expansion \ngrant program: Planning, Development,\
      \ and \nImplementation (CCBHC-PDI) grants assist clinics \nto establish and\
      \ implement new CCBHC programs, \nand Improvement and Advancement (CCBHC-IA)\
      \ \ngrants support existing CCBHCs to enhance and \nimprove their programs.\n\
      The CCBHC model is also supported through \nMedicaid. Section 223 of the Protecting\
      \ Access \nto Medicare Act of 2014 authorized a Medicaid \nCCBHC Demonstration\
      \ program that provides \ncost-based reimbursement for the delivery of nine\
      \ \nrequired CCBHC services, which include crisis \nservices, through a Prospective\
      \ Payment System \n(PPS). This PPS provides states and CCBHCs the \nopportunity\
      \ to design a comprehensive package \nof behavioral health services that is\
      \ paid via cost-\nbased rates. This is different from the traditional \nway\
      \ of financing services, which typically focuses \non payment of individual\
      \ services at rates which \nmay not cover the full cost of providing services.\
      \ \nIn 2024, CMS released Section 223 CCBHC \nDemonstration PPS Guidance (PDF)\
      \ for the \nCCBHC Demonstration as well as its Updated \nCCBHC Cost Report in\
      \ support of new payment \nflexibilities provided to states participating in\
      \ the \nCCBHC Demonstration.188 Since 2019, some \nstates have also supported\
      \ the CCBHC model \nthrough existing Medicaid state plan options \nand waivers.\
      \ A new CCBHC Medicaid state plan \noption was also authorized under Division\
      \ G, \nTitle I, Subtitle B, Section 209 of the Consolidated \nAppropriation\
      \ Act, 2024. For more information on \nCCBHCs, you can visit the SAMHSA CCBHC.\
      \ \nThe National Council on Mental Wellbeing has \nalso released, The Role of\
      \ Certified Community \nBehavioral Health Clinics in Crisis Services and \n\
      Systems, which describes how CCBHCs can be a \nvital part of crisis systems.189\n\
      Reimbursement Strategies\nExpanded reimbursement opportunities can \ncomplement\
      \ infrastructure and capital investment \nthrough coverage of professional and\
      \ ancillary \nservices in crisis settings. Optimal reimbursement \nwill take\
      \ an all-payer approach and should \naddress issues of misaligned incentives\
      \ and parity, \nparticularly where there remains lack of clarity \naround how\
      \ parity applies to crisis services. The \ncrisis system is currently structured\
      \ in a way to \ndisincentivize treating the most under-resourced \npeople and\
      \ the most acute crises. Adults and \nyouth with complex presentations, high\
      \ levels of \nacuity, who are uninsured or with limited supports \nare disproportionately\
      \ burdened with lengthier \nED stays, seclusion and restraint, and poor \nconnections\
      \ to ongoing care. The current fiscal \nlandscape also generally incentivizes\
      \ the number \nof visits over quality of care. In addition, the overall \nspecialty\
      \ behavioral health system has not been at \nthe forefront of value-based care\
      \ payment model \ndevelopment. A BHCSCC that includes emergency \ncapable care\
      \ should be compensated appropriately \nto care for everyone in a way that achieves\

      \ of Washington, in addition to passing \na cellular telephone fee, passed comprehensive\
      \ \nlegislation that requires coverage of behavioral \nhealth crisis services\
      \ though commercial \ninsurance payment vehicles.\n • Tucson, Arizona developed\
      \ its capital \ninfrastructure for its high-intensity behavioral \nhealth emergency\
      \ and high-intensity behavioral \nhealth extended stabilization centers through\
      \ a \nlocal bond that permits facility construction.\n • Counties in Michigan\
      \ can use alcohol beverage \ntax funds to support SUD-related crisis care.\n\
      \ • A great number of states are supporting a \nwide array of services across\
      \ the BHCSCC in \ntheir communities through the use of opioid \nsettlement funds,\
      \ acknowledging the importance \nof no and low barrier access to services such\
      \ \nas emergency and crisis services to SUD-\nprevention and treatment as well\
      \ as the great \nmental health comorbidity with that of SUDs.\n • States, local\
      \ governments, tribes, territories, and \njurisdictions have engaged private\
      \ partnerships, \nfoundations, and philanthropy in order to fund \ntheir BHCSCCs.\n\
      In addition, parity enforcement is a key priority \nwith respect to financing\
      \ crisis services. The \nMental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act \n(MHPAEA)\
      \ requires that the financial requirements \n(such as coinsurance and copays)\
      \ and treatment \nlimitations (such as visit limits or prior authorization \n\
      requirements) imposed on mental health and \nSUD benefits cannot be more restrictive\
      \ than \nthe predominant financial requirements and \ntreatment limitations\
      \ that apply substantially to \nall medical and surgical benefits in the same\
      \ \nbenefit classification.190 However, 15 years after \nMHPAEA’s enactment,\
      \ people with mental health \nand SUDs still face barriers to treatment when\
      \ \nbenefits are denied that they reasonably expected \nto be covered by their\
      \ health plan. Such gaps \nin care can potentially complicate existing crisis\
      \ \nepisodes and increase the risk of future episodes.\nIn order to pay for\
      \ sustainability in crisis services, \nthe payment has to be matched to the\
      \ true cost \nof the service. This usually means bundled \ncost-based rates\
      \ for services with flexibility to \naccommodate different levels of intensity\
      \ within \nthe same program. Reimbursement approaches \nwill be only partially\
      \ successful unless there is \nconsideration of underwriting for service availability\
      \ \nas well as recognizing the need to establish rates \nthat will facilitate\
      \ recruitment and retention of \nlicensed and credentialed professional workers.\
      \ \nIn addition, current evidence-based services that \ngenerally are uncompensated,\
      \ such as crisis care \nfollow-up, need more explicit inclusion in health \n\
      plans. Providers can structure service delivery \nto optimize reimbursement.\
      \ Given that provider \nenrollment can be challenging for smaller provider \n\
      organizations, one potential solution is to pool \nadministrative resources\
      \ to decrease burden. \nIn addition, organizations can think creatively \nand\
      \ have flexibility with staffing to make the best \nuse of licensed professionals,\
      \ including use of \nincident-to-billing.\n78\nNATIONAL GUIDELINES\nfor a Behavioral\

      \ Plans\nPartnerships with commercial payers are at an \nearly developmental\
      \ stage in the crisis landscape \nand represent an opportunity to further strengthen\
      \ \npayment for these services. Commercial plans \ncover the vast majority of\
      \ people in the United \nStates, either through group or direct purchase \n\
      plans. Engaging them in this systems work is \ncritical, both in terms of the\
      \ value for their members \nbut also the potential to decrease inpatient stays\
      \ \nand implement BHCSCCs that prevent future \ncrises. Some of this work is\
      \ well underway. \nFor example, Michigan has been working with \nMichigan Blue\
      \ Cross, which provides coverage \nfor about 40 percent of Michiganders, to\
      \ define \nservice benefits and codes to support commercial \nreimbursement.\n\
      Medicaid\nAs one of the largest sources of funding for \nmental health and SUD\
      \ services, Medicaid \nhas a significant interest in ensuring access \nto emergency\
      \ and crisis stabilization. There \nare several authorities within Medicaid\
      \ \nthat can be used to provide services \nalong the crisis continuum. The Medicaid\
      \ \noption for providing enhanced payment for \nqualifying community-based mobile\
      \ crisis \nintervention services (PDF) is one example.191 \nSection 5124 of\
      \ the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2023 (CAA, 2023) requires the Secretary\
      \ \nof HHS, in coordination with CMS and the HHS \nAssistant Secretary for Mental\
      \ Health and \nSubstance Use, to issue guidance to states on \nthe continuum\
      \ of behavioral health crisis services \nand how states may support implementing\
      \ \nthis continuum through Medicaid and CHIP.192 \nThis guidance that is under\
      \ development and \nscheduled to be released in 2025 will provide \nmore detail\
      \ on opportunities to enhance crisis \nservice sustainability.\nMedicare\nStates\
      \ and communities can consider models \ndeveloped through CMS’ Center for Medicare\
      \ and \nMedicaid Innovation (Innovation Center). These \nmodels have been developed\
      \ and research-tested \nthrough demonstrations across the United States \nto\
      \ support healthcare system transformation. The \nMaryland Total Cost of Care\
      \ approach is one such \nmodel.193 This model has made a nearly $80M \ninvestment\
      \ in the state’s crisis services through \nthe Health Services Cost Review System\
      \ Regional \nPartnership Catalyst Grant Program. Building \non the Maryland\
      \ model, which has a focus on \nbehavioral health crisis care, the CMS Innovation\
      \ \nCenter launched the States Advancing All-Payer \nHealth Equity Approaches\
      \ and Development \n(AHEAD) Model to focus on multi-payer alignment \nfor state\
      \ and regional healthcare transformation \nwith the goal of improving the total\
      \ health of state \npopulations and lowering costs.194\nAdditionally, Medicare\
      \ has created new coding \nand payment for safety planning interventions for\
      \ \nindividuals at high risk for suicide or overdose, \nand also U.S. Food and\
      \ Drug Administration- \n(FDA) cleared digital mental health treatments, \n\
      which went into effect January 1, 2025. Starting \nJanuary 1, 2024, CMS is paying\
      \ for service \nperformed by peer support workers under \nthe supervision of\
      \ a billing practitioner (these \nservices are called principal illness navigation-\n\
      peer support). Additionally, CMS is now enrolling \nMarriage and Family Therapists\
      \ and Mental Health \nCounselors as Medicare providers, covering \nIntensive\
      \ Outpatient Program Services, and have \nexpanded billing for services, such\
      \ as behavioral \nhealth integration services.195\nOn January 18, 2024, CMS\
      \ announced the \nInnovation in Behavioral Health (IBH) Model. The \nIBH Model\

      \ by supporting \na long-term relationship between the beneficiary \nand a behavioral\
      \ health provider, and can be a \ncomponent of comprehensive crisis prevention\

      \ the model does not encompass \npayment for physical or behavioral health \n\
      procedures, tests, or other services, including \ncrisis services. States could\
      \ implement the IBH \nModel in a way that would support longitudinal care \n\
      for beneficiaries coming out of the crisis system. \nAdditionally, IBH Model\
      \ infrastructure funding \nwill allow practice participants to enhance their\
      \ \nsystems, which could allow for real-time tracking of \nbeneficiary involvement\

      \ \nopportunities through federal partners that they \ncan use to support BHCSCC\
      \ infrastructure, \nbuild service capacity, and enhance the crisis \ncontinuum\
      \ of care for communities. Federal \nprograms such as the Community Mental Health\
      \ \nServices Block Grant (including, but not limited \nto the five percent reserved\
      \ for crisis care \nservices), Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, \nand Recovery\
      \ Services Block Grant, CCBHC \nExpansion Grants, Community Crisis Response\
      \ \nPartnerships Cooperative Agreements, State \nOpioid Response (SOR) grants\
      \ for crisis services \nthat focus on opioids and/or stimulants and \nco-occurring\
      \ conditions, and Children’s Mental \nHealth Initiative Grants, can be used\
      \ as funding \nstrategies to support the BHCSCC. In addition, \nSAMHSA and other\
      \ federal agencies routinely \nprovide grant support to communities through\
      \ \nvarious programs. There are a range of resources \nacross federal partners,\
      \ including the Indian Health \nService Suicide Prevention and Care Program\
      \ \nand the Collaborative Crisis Response and \nIntervention Training Program\

      \ Crisis Guidelines\n**Document Pages:** 104 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 85]\nMaking\
      \ the Business Case for \na BHCSCC\nThere has been considerable debate on the\
      \ \nneed to demonstrate return on investment or cost \nsavings to justify the\
      \ costs of behavioral health \ncrisis services. SAMHSA’s vision is that emergency\
      \ \ncapable services should exist across the crisis \ncontinuum without the\
      \ need to demonstrate cost \nbenefit (similar to 911 and EDs). However, there\
      \ is \nbroad recognition that partners, including payers, \nstates, local governments,\
      \ tribes, territories, and \njurisdictions, can benefit from such business cases\
      \ \nwhen considering burden on plan participants and \ntaxpayers. It has been\
      \ posited that more effective \ncrisis care would have significant financial\
      \ benefits \nthat extend beyond the healthcare arena, including \ndecreased\
      \ disability, lower utilization of high-cost \nhealthcare services, and decreased\
      \ reliance on law \nenforcement and jails. Because costs and benefits \nare\
      \ applied in different sectors, it is challenging \nto make direct inferences\
      \ about cost savings. \nHowever, if a community has success strategically \n\
      engaging potential contributors and beneficiaries in \na collaborative process\
      \ of BHCSCC development, \ntwo things may become clear:\n1. The more contributors\
      \ there are, the less \nburdensome each required contribution will be \nto make\
      \ a successful BHCSCC.\n2. Each contributor, in a well-designed system, \nwill\
      \ gain value from their contribution. The value \nmay be different, and it may\
      \ or may not lead \nto a financial “profit,” but it will be valuable in \nother\
      \ ways. Insurers may reduce unnecessary \nhospitalizations and ED costs; hospital\
      \ systems \nmay reduce unnecessary burden on ED \nthroughput and volume; local\
      \ governments \nmay find reduction of costly inefficient utilization \nof limited\
      \ law enforcement resources; and \nfoundations and other community investors\
      \ \nmay benefit from reductions in negative \noutcomes and community struggles\
      \ that are \nassociated with the lack of effective BHCSCCs.\nBehavioral Health\
      \ Crisis Workforce Recruitment, \nRetention, and Support\nBehavioral health\
      \ crisis workforce shortages are \ncommon in communities across the United States\
      \ \nand are of particular concern with professions \nthat require a high level\
      \ of specialized training, \nincluding psychiatrists, addiction medicine \n\
      specialist physicians, and licensed clinical staff.200 \nThese shortages impact\
      \ BHCSCCs as well as the \nbroader specialty behavioral health system, and \n\
      they are expected to continue in the future.201 It \nis important to identify\
      \ and implement behavioral \nhealth crisis workforce strategies for recruitment,\
      \ \nretention, and support, including approaches for \ncertified peers, 988\
      \ and mobile crisis responders, \ncare coordinators, counselors, and other trained\
      \ \ncrisis professionals. Addressing crisis workforce \nconcerns and supporting\
      \ crisis teams that reflect \nthe communities they serve will help increase\
      \ \naccess, equity, and quality of crisis care for \nindividuals and families.\
      \ Improving BHCSCC \nworkforce support also will help address the fourth \n\
      goal of the quintuple aim to address worker well-\nbeing and improve the workforce\
      \ experience.202\nIn 2023, the Action Alliance convened the Crisis \nWorkforce\
      \ Task Force, a group comprised \nof national crisis workforce experts from\
      \ the \npublic and private sector to delineate the issues \naffecting the crisis\
      \ workforce and develop \nrecommendations for addressing them. In 2024, \n81\n\

      \ Crisis Guidelines\n**Document Pages:** 104 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 90]\nConclusion\n\
      The 2025 National Crisis Guidelines represents \na critical step in reimagining\
      \ how the United \nStates addresses behavioral health crises. By \nemphasizing\
      \ a comprehensive, integrated, and \nequitable approach, these guidelines lay\
      \ the \nfoundation for a system that ensures no individual \nfaces a behavioral\
      \ health crisis without access to \nappropriate support and resources.\nThrough\
      \ the development and strengthening of \ncrisis services such as the 988 Lifeline,\
      \ mobile \ncrisis and outreach services, and crisis stabilization \nservices,\
      \ the nation can move toward a future \nwhere timely, person-centered, recovery-oriented,\
      \ \nand quality care is the standard. This vision \nextends beyond immediate\
      \ crisis intervention, \naiming to address systemic inequities, reduce \nreliance\
      \ on emergency services, and promote \nwholistic health and resilience for individuals\
      \ \nand communities. The path forward requires the \ncontinued commitment of\
      \ federal, state, tribal, \nand local governments, alongside community \npartners,\
      \ service providers, and individuals with \nlived experiences. By working collaboratively,\
      \ these \npartners can transform behavioral health crisis \nresponse into a\
      \ system that is not only effective \nbut also compassionate and inclusive.\n\
      The guidelines are not an endpoint but a roadmap \nfor ongoing progress. They\
      \ provide a vision for the \nfuture—a future where behavioral health crises\
      \ are \nmet with understanding, support, and actionable \ncare, ensuring the\
      \ well-being and dignity of all \nindividuals. Together, we can build a crisis\
      \ care \nsystem that truly provides “Someone to Contact, \nSomeone to Respond,\
      \ and a Safe Place for Help” \nand serves “anyone, anywhere, at any time.”220\n\

      \ (SAMHSA) is the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services agency that\
      \ leads public health efforts to reduce the impact of substance \nabuse and\
      \ mental illness on America’s communities. An important component of SAMHSA’s\
      \ work is \nfocused on dissemination of evidence-based practices, and providing\
      \ training and technical assistance to \nhealthcare practitioners on implementation\
      \ of these best practices. \nThe Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) series\
      \ contributes to SAMHSA’s mission by providing \nscience-based, best-practice\
      \ guidance to the behavioral health field. TIPs reflect careful consideration\
      \ of \nall relevant clinical and health service research, demonstrated experience,\
      \ and implementation \nrequirements. Select nonfederal clinical researchers,\
      \ service providers, program administrators, and \npatient advocates comprising\
      \ each TIP’s consensus panel discuss these factors, offering input on the \n\
      TIP’s specific topics in their areas of expertise to reach consensus on best\
      \ practices. Field reviewers then \nassess draft content and the TIP is finalized.\
      \ \nThe talent, dedication, and hard work that TIP panelists and reviewers bring\
      \ to this highly participatory \nprocess have helped bridge the gap between\
      \ the promise of research and the needs of practicing \nclinicians and administrators\

      \ Summary \nThis Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) update is intended to\
      \ provide addiction counselors and \nother providers, supervisors, and administrators\
      \ with the latest science in the screening, assessment, \ndiagnosis, and management\
      \ of co-occurring disorders (CODs). For purposes of this TIP, CODs refer to\
      \ co-\noccurring substance use disorders (SUDs) and mental disorders. Clients\
      \ with CODs have one or more \ndisorders relating to the use of alcohol or other\
      \ substances with misuse potential as well as one or more \nmental disorders.\
      \ A diagnosis of CODs occurs when at least one disorder of each type can be\
      \ established \nindependent of the other and is not simply a cluster of symptoms\
      \ resulting from the one disorder. Many \nmay think of the typical person with\
      \ CODs as having a serious mental illness (SMI) combined with a \nsevere SUD,\
      \ such as schizophrenia combined with alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, counselors\
      \ \nworking in addiction agencies are more likely to see people with severe\
      \ addiction combined with mild- \nto moderate-severity mental disorders; an\
      \ example would be a person with AUD combined with \nattention deficit hyperactivity\
      \ disorder (ADHD) or an anxiety disorder. Efforts to provide treatment that\
      \ \nwill meet the unique needs of people with CODs have gained momentum over\
      \ the past two decades in \nboth SUD treatment and mental health services settings.\
      \ \nAn expert panel developed the TIP’s content based on a review of the most\
      \ up-to-date literature and on \ntheir extensive experience in the field of\
      \ SUD treatment. Other professionals also generously \ncontributed their time\
      \ and commitment to this publication.  \nThis TIP is organized to guide counselors\
      \ and other addiction professionals sequentially through the \nprimary components\
      \ of proper identification and management of CODs. The TIP is divided into chapters\
      \ \nso that readers can easily find the material they need. Following is a summary\
      \ of the TIP’s overall main \npoints and summaries of each of the eight TIP\
      \ chapters. \nThe primary focus of this TIP is co-occurring SUDs and mental\
      \ disorders, not physical disorders. People \nwith mental illness also frequently\
      \ develop physical conditions that, like SUDs, can exacerbate or induce \nsymptoms\
      \ (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus, hypothyroidism). However, physical conditions\
      \ are beyond the \nscope of this publication and are excluded. \nOverall Key\
      \ Messages \nPeople with SUDs are more likely than those without SUDs to have\
      \ co-occurring mental disorders. \nAddiction counselors encounter clients with\
      \ CODs as a rule, not an exception. Mental disorders likely \nto co-occur with\
      \ addiction include depressive disorders, bipolar I disorder, posttraumatic\
      \ stress disorder \n(PTSD), personality disorders (PDs), anxiety disorders,\
      \ schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, \nADHD, and eating and feeding\
      \ disorders. \nSerious gaps exist between the treatment and service needs of\
      \ people with CODs and the actual care \nthey receive. Many factors contribute\
      \ to the gap, such as lack of awareness about and training in CODs \nby addiction\
      \ counselors, as well as workforce factors, like labor shortages and professional\
      \ burnout. \nFailure to routinely screen clients receiving behavioral health\
      \ services for mental disorders and SUDs \ncreates a problematic domino effect.\
      \ A lack of screening begets a lack of assessment, which begets a \nlack of\
      \ diagnosis, which leads to a lack of treatment, which then reduces a person’s\
      \ chances of achieving \nlong-term recovery for either or both disorders. Counselors\
      \ and other providers can prevent this"

      \ and SUDs.  \nCODs are treatable conditions, and a range of treatment modalities\
      \ exists that can be implemented \nacross numerous inpatient and outpatient\
      \ settings. Counselors may need to adapt interventions based \non the treatment\
      \ setting as well as the unique needs and characteristics of clients, including\
      \ their \ngender, race/ethnicity, life circumstance (e.g., homelessness, involvement\
      \ in the criminal justice \nsystem), symptoms, functioning, stage of change,\
      \ risk of suicidality, and trauma history. \nPeople with CODs are at an elevated\
      \ risk for self-harm, especially if they have a history of trauma. \nCounselors,\
      \ other providers, supervisors, and administrators should make client safety\
      \ a priority and \nensure providers have the necessary training to detect and\
      \ respond to suicidal thoughts, gestures, and \nattempts in COD clientele. \n\
      Essential services for people with CODs are person centered, trauma informed,\
      \ culturally responsive, \nrecovery oriented, comprehensive, and continuously\
      \ offered across all levels of care and disease course. \nThere is no “wrong\
      \ door” by which people with CODs arrive at treatment. Counselors and programs\
      \ \nshould have a range of interventions and services in their “toolbox” with\
      \ which they can help all clients.  \nAdministrators and supervisors play a\
      \ critical role in responding to workforce challenges, such as \nunmet training\
      \ needs, low employee retention, staff burnout, and low competency in advanced\
      \ COD \nmanagement skills. Such workforce matters are directly tied to treatment\
      \ availability and quality, so \nthese challenges should be taken seriously\
      \ and addressed actively by all COD treatment programs. \nContent Overview \n\
      This TIP is divided into eight chapters designed to thoroughly cover all relevant\
      \ aspects of screening, \nassessment, diagnosis, treatment, and programming.\
      \ \nChapter 1: Introduction to SUD Treatment for People With CODs \nThis chapter\
      \ provides a broad introduction to CODs and to SUD treatment for people with\
      \ CODs. It \nserves as an outline of the main focus of this TIP. The intended\
      \ audiences are addiction counselors and \nother SUD treatment professionals\
      \ (e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers, \n\
      licensed marriage and family therapists, psychiatric and mental health nurses\
      \ [specialty practice \nregistered nurses]), supervisors, and administrators.\
      \ \nMental illness is highly comorbid in people with addiction and associated\
      \ with low rates of treatment \nengagement, retention, and completion. CODs\
      \ are linked to numerous negative health outcomes and \nlife circumstances,\
      \ like elevated risk of homelessness, trauma, and self-harm. To close treatment\
      \ gaps \nand ensure people with SUDs and mental disorders achieve long-lasting\
      \ recovery, educating counselors, \nsupervisors, and administrators about the\
      \ prevalence and seriousness of these conditions is essential. \nIn Chapter\
      \ 1, readers will learn about: \n• \nThe appropriate terminology surrounding\
      \ CODs and COD treatment approaches. \n• \nThe numerous factors that led to\
      \ the creation of this TIP update. \n• \nThe need for this TIP, which addresses\
      \ CODs and summarizes prevalence and treatment rates, \ntrends in programming,\
      \ and negative events associated with CODs (e.g., increased hospitalization)."

      \ SUDs that can make \ndiagnosing and treating these conditions difficult. \n\
      Chapter 2: Guiding Principles for Working With People Who Have CODs \nThis chapter\
      \ reviews strategies and recommended guidelines for effective COD services.\
      \ The intended \naudiences are counselors and other behavioral health service\
      \ providers, supervisors, and administrators. \nService provision guidelines\
      \ help safeguard the well-being of clients with CODs and ensure they receive\
      \ \nhigh-quality, evidence-based care. Counselors and other providers, supervisors,\
      \ and administrators can \ntake small but powerful steps to increase the likelihood\
      \ that clients with CODs get the services they \nneed, such as using person-centered\
      \ approaches, providing comprehensive care, and integrating \nresearch into\
      \ clinical services. These strategies can have a large impact in terms of generating\
      \ positive \ntreatment outcomes. \nIn Chapter 2, readers will learn that: \n\
      • \nEssential services for people with CODs must be recovery oriented, culturally\
      \ responsive, and \ninclusive of the client’s family or support system (including\
      \ mutual-aid and peer recovery supports). \n• \nCounselors should ensure they\
      \ are providing clients full access to treatments; routine screening and \n\
      complete assessments; services tailored to each client’s symptoms and stage\
      \ of change; and services \nthat are integrated, comprehensive, and continuous\
      \ across treatment settings and disease course. \n• \nAdministrators and supervisors\
      \ can increase the odds of clients achieving optimal recovery \noutcomes by\
      \ ensuring providers possess the appropriate basic, intermediate, and advanced\
      \ \ncompetencies and have access to training opportunities—both of which are\
      \ essential if counselors \nare to confidently and competently manage CODs.\
      \ \n• \nIntegrating evidence-based care into COD programming increases the chances\
      \ of clients receiving \neffective therapies that improve their odds of lifelong\
      \ recovery. \n• \nIn addition to establishing essential services (e.g., screening\
      \ and assessment, onsite prescribing, \npsychoeducation, mutual support), program\
      \ developers and administrators should engage in \nongoing assessment to ensure\
      \ their organization has the capacity to serve clients with CODs and is \nfaithfully\
      \ following service implementation guidelines. \nChapter 3: Screening and Assessment\
      \ of CODs \nThis chapter describes the screening and full assessment process\
      \ for identifying people with and at risk \nfor mental illnesses and SUDs. The\
      \ intended audiences are addiction counselors and other providers, \nsupervisors,\
      \ and administrators. \nTo reduce gaps in treatment access and provision, counselors\
      \ must appropriately engage in timely, \nevidence-based screening and assessment.\
      \ This multistep process is designed to help counselors \nthoroughly explore\
      \ all areas of clients’ history, symptoms, functioning, readiness for treatment,\
      \ and \nother service needs so that treatment decision making is fully informed\
      \ and tailored to each individual’s \nclinical situation. In short, without\
      \ fast and effective screening and assessment, the chances of clients \nreceiving\
      \ appropriate care decrease significantly.  \nIn Chapter 3, readers will learn\
      \ that: \n• \nAll SUD treatment clients should be routinely screened, at least\
      \ annually, for SUDs, mental \ndisorders, risk of harm to self and others, functional\
      \ impairment, and trauma."

      \ and family histories for indications \nof addiction, mental illness, or both.\
      \ \n• \nThere are numerous screening and assessment measures validated for use\
      \ with people who have \nmental disorders and SUDs to help counselors make diagnostic\
      \ determinations and inform the need \nfor referral for further evaluation (e.g.,\
      \ psychiatric, medical). \n• \nAssessment is more than just administering questionnaires;\
      \ it includes exploring clients’ risk of harm \nto self and others, trauma history,\
      \ strengths and supports, cultural needs, and readiness for change. \n• \nWhen\
      \ performed correctly, a full assessment should help build rapport between the\
      \ counselor and \nclient and foster shared decision making for treatment or\
      \ other services. \nChapter 4: Mental and Substance-Related Disorders: Diagnostic\
      \ and Cross-Cutting Topics \nThis chapter will help readers learn the DSM-5\
      \ diagnostic criteria for mental disorders that commonly \noccur alongside SUDs,\
      \ as well as symptoms of substance-related disorders. The intended audiences\
      \ are \naddiction counselors and other providers, supervisors, and administrators.\
      \ \nNot all addiction counselors are permitted to diagnose mental disorders\
      \ (regulations vary by state). \nHowever, all addiction counselors and other\
      \ providers should become familiar with the diagnostic \ncriteria for mental\
      \ illnesses that commonly co-occur with SUDs so that they can refer clients\
      \ for a full \npsychiatric evaluation (if needed) and tailor treatment and service\
      \ provision accordingly. In some \ninstances, treatment approaches for CODs\
      \ will differ slightly than if the person had only an SUD or only a \nmental\
      \ illness (but not both). It is imperative that counselors and other providers\
      \ understand how to \nrecognize signs of highly comorbid mental illnesses, know\
      \ how these disorders affect treatment decision \nmaking, and recognize the\
      \ risk of self-harm and trauma history associated with these disorders. Equally\
      \ \nimportant, clinicians should learn how to differentiate independent mental\
      \ disorders from substance-\ninduced mental disorders, as the latter are often\
      \ treated differently than the former (if they require \ntreatment at all, given\
      \ that many substance-induced conditions remit once substance use has ended).\
      \ \nIn Chapter 4, readers will learn that: \n• \nMental disorders that most\
      \ commonly co-occur with SUDs include major depressive disorder, \npersistent\
      \ depressive disorder (dysthymia), bipolar I disorder, PTSD, borderline and\
      \ antisocial PDs, \nschizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, generalized\
      \ anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety \ndisorder, ADHD, anorexia\
      \ nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder.  \n• \nAlthough less\
      \ common in the general population, all of these mental disorders are likely\
      \ to be seen \nby counselors working in SUD treatment settings. \n• \nCounselors\
      \ may need to treat SUDs in the presence of a mental disorder in slightly different\
      \ ways \nthan treating addiction without comorbid mental illness. The way in\
      \ which treatment proceeds can \nvary depending on the mental illness at hand.\
      \ \n• \nNearly all CODs carry an increased risk of suicide, and counselors are\
      \ obligated to thoroughly assess \nand respond to a current report or history\
      \ of self-harm in people with CODs. \n• \nTrauma is ubiquitous across CODs and\
      \ needs to be managed using trauma-informed techniques. \n• \nMany mental disorder\
      \ symptoms mimic symptoms of SUDs, and vice versa. Being able to \ndifferentiate\
      \ between the two is a core competency."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \n \nPage xv \n• \nSimilarly,\
      \ many mental disorders may appear in the context of substance intoxication\
      \ or withdrawal. \nTreatment approaches for these substance-induced disorders\
      \ can differ from the treatment of \nindependent mental disorders, so counselors\
      \ must recognize the difference between the two.  \nChapter 5: Strategies for\
      \ Working With People Who Have CODs \nThis chapter summarizes the importance\
      \ of establishing a therapeutic alliance with clients who have \nCODs and discusses\
      \ how providers can do so. The intended audiences are addiction counselors and\
      \ \nother providers, supervisors, and administrators. \nGood provider–client\
      \ rapport can enhance treatment outcomes and completion and is a cornerstone\
      \ of \nproviding high-quality care. When working with clients who have CODs,\
      \ counselors and other providers \nshould be aware of clinical factors and concerns,\
      \ like confidentiality matters, use of empathy, and \ndeveloping cultural responsiveness,\
      \ that can make the therapeutic relationship more successful and \nincrease\
      \ the chances that clients will achieve and maintain recovery.  \nFor co-occurring\
      \ mental disorders, like depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, and SMIs, specific\
      \ treatment \nstrategies (e.g., selecting appropriate therapeutic interventions;\
      \ structuring clinical sessions) can \nimprove client adherence and outcomes.\
      \ Counselors and other providers should learn these techniques \nand approaches\
      \ prior to treating individuals with CODs so that they will be prepared to best\
      \ respond to \nclients’ needs and can help establish good therapeutic alliance\
      \ from the outset.  \nIn Chapter 5, readers will learn that: \n• \nRapport building\
      \ is essential in helping clients achieve and sustain positive behavior change.\
      \ \n• \nWorking with people who have CODs can be challenging given clients’\
      \ feelings of mistrust or shame. \nCODs can be complex and lifelong, causing\
      \ a range of difficulties for people living with them. \n• \nA successful therapeutic\
      \ alliance is built on empathy and support and by providing services fully \n\
      responsive to all clients’ needs. \n• \nRelapse prevention and skill building\
      \ are critical components of comprehensive care. \n• \nCulturally sensitive\
      \ techniques can help build rapport and trust between counselors and clients\
      \ from \nvarious cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. \n• \nFor clients\
      \ with depression, cognitive–behavioral techniques, behavioral activation, and\
      \ medication \nevaluation are core services. \n• \nClients with anxiety may\
      \ need treatments tailored to their anxiety diagnosis, such as individual \n\
      therapy for a client with social anxiety and fear of group settings. \n• \n\
      Safety and trust are cornerstones of effective treatment for people with trauma\
      \ and PTSD. \n• \nPeople with SMI may have cognitive limitations that undermine\
      \ treatment participation and \nadherence and may need help with basic living\
      \ needs (e.g., housing, employment). \nChapter 6: CODs Among Special Populations\
      \ \nThis chapter discusses four populations with CODs who may be especially\
      \ susceptible to treatment \nchallenges and negative outcomes: people experiencing\
      \ homelessness, people involved in the criminal \njustice system, women, and\
      \ racial/ethnic minorities. The intended audiences are SUD counselors and \n\
      other providers, supervisors, and administrators. \nAlthough all people with\
      \ CODs are vulnerable to treatment difficulties and poor outcomes because of\
      \ \nthe complex and chronic nature of their illnesses, certain COD populations\
      \ are especially susceptible and"

      \ to specific \ntreatment needs of such populations and make adjustments in\
      \ their assessment, diagnosis, referral, and \nservice provision accordingly.\
      \ \nIn Chapter 6, readers will learn that: \n• \nCODs are highly prevalent in\
      \ people who are homeless, but several service models exist to help \ncounselors\
      \ address clients’ behavioral health concerns and their housing needs. \n• \n\
      People involved in the criminal justice system are at risk for CODs both during\
      \ incarceration and \nafter release into the community. \n• \nTreatment of CODs\
      \ among justice system–involved people is important because, if left untreated,\
      \ \nCODs can increase their risk of recidivism, rearrest, and reincarceration.\
      \ \n• \nWomen are a vulnerable population because of their increased odds of\
      \ trauma, which heightens the \noccurrence of CODs, and pregnancy/childcare-related\
      \ factors, which also can exacerbate CODs or \notherwise affect treatment provision\
      \ (such as pharmacotherapy). \n• \nAlthough research suggests that COD treatment\
      \ outcomes for men and women are generally \nequivalent, women may benefit from\
      \ gender-specific services in order to stay engaged in (and thus \nbenefit from)\
      \ interventions. \n• \nCompared with U.S. Whites, people from racial/ethnic\
      \ minorities face significantly greater mental \nhealth service and SUD treatment\
      \ access barriers and are likelier to have negative treatment \noutcomes.  \n\
      • \nCounselors and other providers should learn and be ready to provide culturally\
      \ responsive \nassessments and treatments or other services to meet the unique\
      \ needs facing clients of diverse \nracial/ethnic backgrounds who have CODs.\
      \ \nChapter 7: Treatment Models and Settings for People With CODs \nThis chapter\
      \ is an overview of treatment models and settings for clients with CODs. It\
      \ will help \ncounselors and administrators offer empirically supported care\
      \ for this population. The intended \naudiences are counselors and other providers,\
      \ supervisors, and administrators in addiction programs. \nCODs are complex\
      \ conditions, and clients can engage in services across a multitude of inpatient\
      \ and \noutpatient settings. Counselors and other providers have several empirically\
      \ validated treatment \napproaches at their disposal designed to address the\
      \ full scope of needs of people with CODs, including \nservices to reduce symptoms,\
      \ increase abstinence, achieve stable housing, and help clients make \nmeaningful\
      \ connections with resources and networks of support in the community. Although\
      \ not \nappropriate for all clients with CODs, pharmacotherapies are a treatment\
      \ option that, for certain \nconditions like AUD and opioid use disorder (OUD),\
      \ can not only improve functioning but reduce \nmortality and morbidity. Counselors\
      \ and other providers may not prescribe medication for clients with \nCODs but\
      \ should nonetheless be aware of their uses, side effects, and interactions/warnings\
      \ so that they \ncan help monitor clients for safety and offer referrals for\
      \ medication evaluation as needed. \nIn Chapter 7, readers will learn that:\
      \ \n• \nCOD treatment can be sequential, simultaneous (but in parallel), or\
      \ concurrent (and integrated).  \n• \nPeople with CODs face a multitude of individual,\
      \ logistic, socioeconomic, cultural, organizational, \nsystemic, and policy-related\
      \ barriers to accessing and utilizing SUD treatment and mental health \nservices.\
      \ Counselors and administrators play important roles in reducing these barriers\
      \ and helping \nclients overcome such challenges."

      Integrated care is recommended as a best practice for serving people with CODs.\
      \ \n• \nAssertive community outreach and intensive case management are multidisciplinary\
      \ approaches \nthat can be easily adapted to integrated settings and thus offer\
      \ clients comprehensive, continuous \ncare. They also can be adapted to populations\
      \ vulnerable to CODs and poor outcomes, like people \nwithout stable housing\
      \ and those involved in the criminal justice system. \n• \nMutual supports,\
      \ including from peer recovery support specialists, are critical because they\
      \ offer \nclients information and support from others with a lived experience\
      \ with mental illness, SUDs, or \nboth. Many COD-specific mutual support programs\
      \ are available, and counselors should keep \nreferral information on hand so\
      \ they can readily refer clients interested in these services. \n• \nProviders\
      \ can offer COD services in many different settings, including therapeutic communities,\
      \ \noutpatient addiction centers, residential treatment facilities, and acute\
      \ medical care facilities. \n• \nPharmacotherapy is often a core part of COD\
      \ treatment, especially for people with depression, \nbipolar I disorder, anxiety,\
      \ schizophrenia/psychotic disorders, AUD, or OUD. Counselors do not \nprescribe\
      \ medication, but they should understand what medications their clients are\
      \ likely to take \nand the side effects clients are likely to experience so\
      \ they can offer proper psychoeducation, help \nmonitor for unsafe side effects,\
      \ and refer clients to prescribers for medication management as \nneeded. \n\
      Chapter 8: Workforce and Administrative Concerns in Working With People Who\
      \ Have \nCODs \nThis chapter reviews major findings facing the mental health\
      \ service and SUD treatment labor force and \ndemonstrates how workforce matters\
      \ can negatively affect clients with CODs. The intended audiences \nare supervisors\
      \ and administrators in SUD treatment. \nProjections about the behavioral health\
      \ workforce suggest that serious gaps will only increase as the \nnumber of\
      \ people entering and staying in the profession is outmatched by the number\
      \ of people in need \nof those professionals’ services. This trend will continue\
      \ without interventions to support the growing \ncapacity and training needs\
      \ of the field. These gaps have resulted in people with CODs having fewer \n\
      opportunities to access high-quality, evidence-based care across a broad continuum\
      \ of settings and \nservices. Further, unmet training, education, and credentialing\
      \ needs in CODs means there is an \ninsufficient number of counselors and supervisors\
      \ who understand the treatment needs of this \npopulation and how best to manage\
      \ these conditions. Ensuring better recruitment and retention of \nwell-trained\
      \ behavioral health professionals is paramount and will help broaden and strengthen\
      \ the SUD \ntreatment and mental health service systems. \nIn Chapter 8, readers\
      \ will learn that: \n• \nThere is a major shortage of mental health and addiction\
      \ professionals in this country, and that \nshortage will only continue to grow\
      \ unless the field uses strategies to increase the size of the \nworkforce and\
      \ retain current professionals. Workforce shortages are in part why people with\
      \ CODs \nface challenges in accessing, engaging in, adhering to, and benefitting\
      \ from services. \n• \nRecruitment, hiring, and retention techniques can help\
      \ programs attract and keep the right \ncandidates while reducing turnover.\
      \ \n• \nBurnout is a major component of turnover and is prominent in these fields\
      \ because of the complex \nand challenging nature of the client population."

      \ to Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People With Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \  \n \n \nPage 1 \n \nChapter 1—Introduction to Substance Use Disorder \nTreatment\
      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders  \n(For Counselors, Other Treatment/Service\
      \ Providers, \nSupervisors, and Administrators) \nWhat is health? The World\
      \ Health Organization (WHO) considers healthy states as ones characterized by\
      \ \n“complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence\
      \ of disease or infirmity” \n(WHO, n.d.). The Department of Health and Human\
      \ Services’ (HHS) Healthy People 2020 initiative also \nsupports a broad definition\
      \ of optimal health, reflected by its overarching goals of (Centers for Disease\
      \ \nControl and Prevention [CDC], 2014): \n• \nHelping people achieve high‑quality,\
      \ long lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and \npremature\
      \ death. \n• \nEstablishing health equity, eliminating disparities, and improving\
      \ the health of all groups. \n• \nPromoting quality of life, healthy development,\
      \ and healthy behaviors across all life stages.  \nThe concept of “well-being”\
      \ extends beyond one’s physical condition and includes equally important \n\
      areas of functioning and quality of life, such as mental illness and SUDs. Healthy\
      \ People 2020 policy \nand prevention goals include reducing substance use among\
      \ all Americans (especially children) and \ndecreasing the prevalence of mental\
      \ disorders (particularly suicidality and depression) while increasing \ntreatment\
      \ access (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2019).  \nSUDs\
      \ and mental disorders are detrimental to the health of individuals and to society\
      \ as a whole. The \ntendency of these disorders to co-occur can make the damage\
      \ they cause more extensive and complex. \nAs knowledge of CODs continues to\
      \ evolve, new challenges have arisen: What is the best way to manage \nCODs\
      \ and reduce lags in treatment? How do we manage especially vulnerable populations\
      \ with CODs, \nsuch as people experiencing homelessness and those in our criminal\
      \ justice system? What about people \nwith addiction and serious mental illness\
      \ (SMI), such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia? What are the \nbest treatment\
      \ environments and modalities? How can we build an integrated system of care?\
      \  \nKey Messages \nPeople with mental illness are likely to have comorbid substance\
      \ use disorders (SUDs) and vice versa. Addiction \ncounselors should expect\
      \ to encounter mental illness in their client population.  \nCo-occurring disorders\
      \ (CODs) are burdensome conditions that exact significant physical, emotional,\
      \ functional, \nsocial, and economic consequences on to the people who live\
      \ with these disorders, their loved ones, and \nsociety as a whole.  \nOver\
      \ the past two decades, the behavioral health field’s knowledge of the prevalence,\
      \ outcomes, service needs, \nand treatment approaches for individuals with CODs\
      \ has expanded considerably. But gaps remain in ready \naccess to services and\
      \ the provision of timely, appropriate, effective, evidence-based care for people\
      \ with CODs. \nCODs are complex and bidirectional. They can wax and wane over\
      \ time. Providers, supervisors, and \nadministrators should be mindful of this\
      \ when helping clients make decisions about treatment and level of care."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 1—Introduction\
      \ to Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People With Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \  \n \n \nPage 2 \n \nThe main purpose of this Treatment Improvement Protocol\
      \ (TIP) is to attempt to answer these and \nrelated questions by providing current,\
      \ evidence-based, practice-informed knowledge about the \nrapidly advancing\
      \ field of COD research. This TIP is primarily for SUD treatment and mental\
      \ health \nservice providers, clinical supervisors, and program administrators.\
      \ \nThis chapter describes the scope of this TIP (both what is included and\
      \ what is excluded by design), its \nintended audience, and the basic approach\
      \ that has guided the selection of strategies, techniques, and \nmodels highlighted\
      \ in the text. Next, a section on terminology, including a box of key terms,\
      \ will help \nprovide a common language and facilitate readers’ understanding\
      \ of core concepts in this TIP. \nFurthermore, the chapter addresses the developments\
      \ that led to this TIP revision as well as the \nunderlying rationale for developing\
      \ a publication on CODs specifically.  \nScope of This TIP \nThe TIP summarizes\
      \ state-of-the-art diagnosis, treatment, and service delivery for CODs in the\
      \ addiction \nand mental health fields. It contains chapters on screening and\
      \ assessment, diagnosis, and treatment \nsettings and models, as well as recommendations\
      \ to address workforce and administration needs. It is \nnot intended for trainees\
      \ or junior professionals lacking a basic background in mental health and \n\
      addiction (see the “Audience” section that follows). It therefore excludes generic,\
      \ introductory \ninformation about mental disorders and SUDs. Of note: \n• \n\
      The primary concern of this TIP is co-occurring SUDs and mental disorders, even\
      \ though it is \nrecognized that this vulnerable population also is subject\
      \ to many other physical conditions. As such, \nco-occurring physical disorders\
      \ common in individuals with SUDs, mental disorders, or both (e.g., \nHIV, hepatitis\
      \ C virus) are beyond the scope of this publication and excluded.  \n• \nNicotine\
      \ dependency, which was treated in the original TIP as an important cross-cutting\
      \ issue, is \nomitted from this update. Since the original development of this\
      \ TIP, considerable and \ncomprehensive treatment resources have become available\
      \ specific to nicotine cessation.  \n• \nPathological gambling, which the Diagnostic\
      \ and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition \n(DSM-5) classifies\
      \ along with other SUDs and which was included in the original TIP, is not addressed\
      \ \nin this update because behavioral addictions are outside its scope.  \n\
      • \nAlthough the TIP addresses several specific populations (i.e., people experiencing\
      \ homelessness; \npeople involved in the criminal justice system; people from\
      \ diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural \nbackgrounds; women; active duty and\
      \ veteran military personnel), it does so briefly. It also omits \ncontent specifically\
      \ for adolescents. The authors fully recognize, and the TIP states repeatedly,\
      \ that \nall COD treatment must be culturally responsive. \nAudience \nThe primary\
      \ audience for this TIP is SUD treatment providers. It is meant to meet the\
      \ needs of those \nwith basic education/experience as well as the differing\
      \ needs of those with intermediate or \nadvanced education. SUD treatment providers\
      \ include drug and alcohol counselors, licensed clinical \nsocial workers and\
      \ psychologists who specialize in addiction treatment, and specialty practice\
      \ registered \nnurses [psychiatric and mental health nurses]). Many such providers\
      \ have addiction counseling \ncertification or related professional licenses.\
      \ Some may have credentials in the treatment of mental \ndisorders or in criminal\
      \ justice services."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 1—Introduction\
      \ to Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People With Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \  \n \n \nPage 3 \n \nOther main audiences for this TIP are mental health practitioners,\
      \ as well as primary care providers \n(e.g., general practitioners, internal\
      \ medicine specialists, family physicians, and nurse practitioners), who \n\
      may encounter patients with CODs in their clinics, private practices, or emergency\
      \ medicine settings.  \nSecondary audiences include administrators, supervisors,\
      \ educators, researchers, criminal justice staff, \nand other healthcare and\
      \ social service providers who work with people who have CODs. \nApproach \n\
      The TIP uses three criteria for inclusion of a particular strategy, technique,\
      \ or model:  \n1. Definitive research (i.e., evidence-based treatments) \n2.\
      \ Well-articulated approaches with empirical support \n3. Consensus panel agreement\
      \ about established clinical practice  \nThe information in this TIP derives\
      \ from a variety of sources, including the research literature, \nconceptual\
      \ writings, descriptions of established program models, accumulated clinical\
      \ experience and \nexpertise, government reports, and other available empirical\
      \ evidence. It reflects the current state of \nclinical wisdom regarding the\
      \ treatment of clients with CODs. \nGuidance for the Reader \nThis TIP is a\
      \ resource document and a guide on CODs. It contains up-to-date knowledge and\
      \ instructive \nmaterial, reviews selected literature, summarizes many COD treatment\
      \ approaches, and covers some \nempirical information. The scope of CODs generated\
      \ a complex and extensive TIP that is probably best \nread by chapter or section.\
      \ It contains text boxes, case histories, illustrations, and summaries to \n\
      synthesize knowledge that is grounded in the practical realities of clinical\
      \ cases and real situations.  \nA special feature throughout the TIP—“Advice\
      \ to the Counselor” boxes—provide direct and accessible \nguidance for the counselor.\
      \ Readers can study these boxes to obtain concise practical guidance. Advice\
      \ \nto the Counselor boxes distill what the counselor needs to know and what\
      \ steps to take; they are \nenriched by more detailed reading of the relevant\
      \ material in each section or chapter. \nThe chair and co-chair of the TIP consensus\
      \ panel encourage collaboration among providers and \ntreatment agencies to\
      \ translate the concepts and methods of this TIP into other useable tools \n\
      specifically shaped to the needs and resources of each agency and situation.\
      \ It is the hope of the \nconsensus panel that the reader will gain from this\
      \ TIP increased knowledge, encouragement, and \nresources for the important\
      \ work of treating people with CODs. \nTerminology in This TIP \nExhibit 1.1\
      \ defines key terms that appear in this TIP. \nExhibit 1.1. Key Terms \n• Addiction*:\
      \ The most severe form of SUD, associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use\
      \ of one or more \nsubstances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has\
      \ the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and \nrecovery. \n• Binge drinking*:\
      \ Binge drinking for men is drinking 5 or more standard alcoholic drinks, and\
      \ for women, 4 or \nmore standard alcoholic drinks on the same occasion on at\
      \ least 1 day in the past 30 days."

      • Heavy drinking*: Defined by the CDC as consuming 8 or more drinks per week\
      \ for women and 15 or more \ndrinks per week for men, and by the Substance Abuse\
      \ and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), \nfor research purposes,\
      \ as binge drinking on 5 or more days in the past 30 days. \n• Integrated interventions:\
      \ Specific treatment strategies or therapeutic techniques in which interventions\
      \ for \nthe SUD and mental disorder are combined in one session or in a series\
      \ of interactions or multiple sessions. \n• Mutual support programs: Mutual\
      \ support programs consist of groups of people who work together to \nachieve\
      \ and maintain recovery. Unlike peer support (e.g., use of recovery coaches),\
      \ mutual support groups \nconsist only of people who volunteer their time and\
      \ typically have no official connection to treatment \nprograms. Most are self-supporting.\
      \ Although 12-Step groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics \nAnonymous\
      \ are the most widespread and well researched type of mutual support groups,\
      \ other groups may \nbe available in some areas. They range from groups affiliated\
      \ with a religion or church (e.g., Celebrate \nRecovery, Millati Islami) to\
      \ purely secular groups (e.g., SMART Recovery, Women for Sobriety). \n• Peer\
      \ recovery support services: The entire range of SUD treatment and mental health\
      \ services that help \nsupport individuals’ recovery and that are provided by\
      \ peers. The peers who provide these services are called \npeer recovery support\
      \ specialists (“peer specialists” for brevity), peer providers, or recovery\
      \ coaches. \n• Relapse*: A return to substance use after a significant period\
      \ of abstinence. \n• Recovery*: A process of change through which individuals\
      \ improve their health and wellness, live a self-\ndirected life, and strive\
      \ to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs\
      \ can, with \nhelp, overcome their SUD and regain health and social function.\
      \ This is called remission. When those positive \nchanges and values become\
      \ part of a voluntarily adopted lifestyle, that is called “being in recovery.”\
      \ \nAlthough abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a\
      \ recovery lifestyle, it is not the only \nhealthy, pro-social feature. \n•\
      \ Standard drink*: Based on the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (HHS,\
      \ U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, 2015) one standard drink contains 14 grams\
      \ (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol:  \n \n• Substance*: A psychoactive compound\
      \ with the potential to cause health and social problems, including \nSUDs (and\
      \ their most severe manifestation, addiction). The insert at the bottom of this\
      \ exhibit lists common \nexamples of such substances."

      \ situation, amount, or frequency that can cause \nharm to users or to those\
      \ around them. For some substances or individuals, any use would constitute\
      \ misuse \n(e.g., underage drinking, injection drug use). \n• Substance use*:\
      \ The use—even one time—of any of the substances listed in the insert.  \n•\
      \ Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a\
      \ substance or substances. \nAccording to the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association\
      \ [APA], 2013), SUDs are characterized by clinically \nsignificant impairments\
      \ in health, social function, and impaired control over substance use and are\
      \ diagnosed \nthrough assessing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms.\
      \ SUDs range from mild to severe and \nfrom temporary to chronic. They typically\
      \ develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to \nchanges in\
      \ brain circuits governing incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated\
      \ cues to trigger \nsubstance seeking), reward, stress, and executive functions\
      \ like decision making and self-control. Multiple \nfactors influence whether\
      \ and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance\
      \ \nitself; the genetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency,\
      \ and duration of the misuse. Note: A \nsevere SUD is commonly called an addiction.\

      \  \n \n \nPage 6 \n \ndepicting substance types and categories come from the\
      \ same source, which is in the public domain. This \nresource provides a great\
      \ deal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public\
      \ \nhealth. The report is available online (https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-\n\
      generals-report.pdf).  \nThe behavioral health field has used many terms to\
      \ describe the group of individuals who have CODs. \nSome of these do not appear\
      \ in this TIP, which attempts to reflect a “person-first” approach (see the\
      \ \n“Person-Centered Terminology” section). It is important for providers and\
      \ other professionals working \nwith people who have CODs to understand that\
      \ some terms that have been commonly related to CODs \nmay now be outdated and,\
      \ in certain cases, pejorative. Such terms include: \n• \nDual diagnosis. \n\
      • \nDually diagnosed. \n• \nDually disordered. \n• \nMentally ill chemical abuser.\
      \ \n• \nMentally ill chemically dependent. \n• \nMentally ill substance abuser.\
      \ \n• \nMentally ill substance using. \n• \nChemically abusing mentally ill.\
      \ \n• \nChemically addicted and mentally ill. \n• \nSubstance abusing mentally\
      \ ill. \nAll of these terms have their uses, but many have connotations that\
      \ are unhelpful or too broad or varied \nin interpretation to be useful. For\
      \ example, “dual diagnosis” also can mean having both mental and \ndevelopmental\
      \ disorders. Outside of this TIP, readers should not assume these terms all\
      \ have the same \nmeaning as CODs and should clarify the client characteristics\
      \ associated with a particular term. Readers \nalso should realize that the\
      \ term “co-occurring disorder” is not always precise. As with other terms, it\
      \ \nmay become distorted over time by common use and come to refer to other\
      \ conditions; after all, clients \nand consumers may have a number of health\
      \ conditions that “co-occur,” including physical illness. \nNevertheless, for\
      \ the purpose of this TIP, CODs refers only to SUDs and mental disorders. \n\
      Some clients’ mental illness symptoms may not fully meet strict definitions\
      \ of co-occurring SUDs and \nmental disorders or criteria for diagnoses in DSM-5\
      \ categories. However, many of the relevant principles \nthat apply to the treatment\
      \ of CODs also will apply to these individuals. Careful assessment and \ntreatment\
      \ planning to take each disorder into account will still be important.  \nPerson-Centered\
      \ Terminology \nThis TIP uses only person-first language—such as “person with\
      \ CODs.” In recent years, consumer \nadvocacy groups have expressed concerns\
      \ related to how clients are classified. Many take exception to \nterminology\
      \ that seems to put them in a “box” with a label that follows them through life,\
      \ that does not \ncapture the fullness of their identities. A person with CODs\
      \ also may be a mother, a plumber, a pianist, a \nstudent, or a person with\
      \ diabetes, to cite just a few examples. Referring to an individual as a person\
      \ \nwho has a specific disorder—a person with depression rather than “a depressive,”\
      \ a person with \nschizophrenia rather than “a schizophrenic,” or a person who\
      \ uses heroin rather than “a heroin \naddict”—is more acceptable to many clients\
      \ because it implies that they have many characteristics \nbeyond a stigmatized\
      \ illness, and therefore they are not defined by this illness."

      \  \n \n \nPage 7 \n \nBecause this TIP’s primary audience is counselors in\
      \ the addiction and mental health fields, this publication uses \nthe term client,\
      \ rather than patient or consumer. \nImportant Developments That Led to This\
      \ TIP Update  \nImportant developments in a number of areas pointed to the need\
      \ for a revised TIP on CODs:  \n• \nOne of the primary factors that led to this\
      \ revised document is the revisions to the diagnostic \nclassification of and\
      \ diagnostic criteria for mental disorders as reflected in DSM-5 (APA, 2013).\
      \ See \nChapter 4 for an indepth discussion of DSM-5 diagnoses. \n• \nThis update\
      \ to TIP 42 offers a greater emphasis on integrated care or concurrent treatment\
      \ (e.g., \ntreating a client’s alcohol use disorder [AUD] at the same time that\
      \ you treat his or her \nposttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), as this is a\
      \ larger focus of the research and clinical field today \nthan when this TIP\
      \ was originally published. More information about treatment approaches are\
      \ in \nChapter 7. \n• \nThis update reflects a wealth of new data about effective\
      \ treatment options for people with CODs, \nincluding those with severe mental\
      \ disorders (see especially Chapter 7). \nWhy Do We Need a TIP on CODs? \nEmpirical\
      \ evidence confirms that CODs are serious problems in need of better management.\
      \ Treatment \nrates are markedly low and outcomes often suboptimal, underscoring\
      \ the importance of advancing the \nfield’s knowledge about and use of appropriate\
      \ yet specialized techniques for screening, assessment, \ndiagnosis, and coordinated\
      \ care of this population. Findings from four key areas are borne out by \n\
      prevalence statistics and other nationally representative survey data and reveal\
      \ the stark reality of \nunderservice in this population. \n“Comorbidity is\
      \ important because it is the rule rather than the exception with mental health\
      \ disorders.” (Lai, \nCleary, Sitharthan, & Hunt, 2015; p. 8) \n1. Prevalence\
      \ and Treatment Need of CODs \nNational surveys suggest mental illness (and\
      \ SMI in particular) commonly co-occurs with substance \nmisuse in the general\
      \ adult population, and many individuals with CODs go untreated. The National\
      \ \nSurvey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), based on a sample of more than 67,700\
      \ U.S. civilians ages 12 \nor older in noninstitutionalized settings (Center\
      \ for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality [CBHSQ], \n2019), offers revealing\
      \ insights. Notable statistics from the latest survey include (CBHSQ, 2019):\
      \  \n• \nIn 2018, 47.6 million (19.1 percent of all adults) adults ages 18 and\
      \ older had any mental illness \nduring the previous year, including 11.4 million\
      \ (4.6 percent of all adults) with SMI. \n−  Among these 47.6 million adults\
      \ with any past-year mental disorder, 9.2 million (19.3 percent) \nalso had\
      \ an SUD, but only 5 percent of adults without any mental illness in the past\
      \ year had an \nSUD.  \n−  Of the 11.4 million adults with an SMI in the previous\
      \ year, approximately 28 percent also had an \nSUD.\n\n[Page 36]\nTIP 42, Substance\
      \ Use Disorder Treatment for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020\
      \ \nChapter 1—Introduction to Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People With\
      \ Co-Occurring Disorders  \n \n \nPage 8 \n \nExhibit 1.2. Co-Occurring Substance\
      \ Misuse in Adults Ages 18 and Older With and \nWithout any Mental Illness and\
      \ SMI (in 2018) \n \nSource: McCance-Katz (2019). Adapted from material in the\
      \ public domain.  \n• \nSMI is highly correlated with substance misuse (Exhibit\
      \ 1.2; McCance-Katz, 2019). Adults ages 18 and \nolder with any past-year mental\
      \ illness were more likely than those without to use illicit drugs or \nmisuse\
      \ prescription medication. This pattern was even more pronounced among people\
      \ with SMI. \nOf the 47.6 million adults with any past-year mental illness,\
      \ more than half (56.7 percent) received \nno treatment, and over one-third\
      \ (35.9 percent) of adults with an SMI in the past year received no \ntreatment.\
      \ Further, nearly all (more than 90 percent) of the 9.2 million adults with\
      \ both a past-\nyear mental illness and SUD did not receive services for both\
      \ conditions (McCance-Katz, 2019). \n• \nAbout 14.2 million adults (about 5.7\
      \ percent of all adults) saw themselves as needing mental health \nservices\
      \ at some point in the previous year but did not receive it (CBHSQ, 2019): \
      \ \n− Of adults with any mental disorder, 11.2 million (almost 24 percent),\
      \ or nearly 1 in 4 adults with \nany mental illness, had a perceived unmet need\
      \ for mental health services in the past year.  \n− Of adults with an SMI, 5.1\
      \ million (about 45 percent), or more than 2 out of every 5 adults with \nSMI,\
      \ had a perceived unmet need for mental health services in the previous year.\
      \ \n• \nMore than 18 million people ages 12 and older needed but did not receive\
      \ SUD treatment in the \nprevious year (e.g., they had an SUD or problems related\
      \ to substance use). Most of those \nindividuals did not see themselves as needing\
      \ treatment (only 5 percent thought they needed it). \n• \nAlmost half (48.6\
      \ percent) of adults ages 18 and older with any mental illness and co-occurring\
      \ \nSUD received no treatment at all in 2018. About 41 percent received mental\
      \ health services only, \n3.3 percent received SUD treatment only, and 7 percent\
      \ received both.  \n• \nOf adults with SMI and co-occurring SUDs, 30.5 percent\
      \ received no treatment. About 56 received \nmental health services only; almost\
      \ 3 percent, SUD treatment only; and about 11 percent received \nboth. \nOther\
      \ nationally representative survey datasets confirm the high rate of comorbidity\
      \ and treatment \nneed for mental disorders and SUDs in the general adult population.\
      \ An analysis of Wave 3 of the \nNational Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and\
      \ Related Conditions (NESARC-III; Grant et al., 2015) \nrevealed an increased\
      \ risk of comorbid mental illness among people with 12-month and lifetime AUD."

      \  \n \n \nPage 9 \n \nSpecifically, the odds of having major depression, bipolar\
      \ disorder, antisocial personality disorder (PD), \nborderline PD (BPD), panic\
      \ disorder, specific phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) ranged from\
      \ \n1.2 to 6.4. Only 20 percent of people with lifetime AUD and 8 percent of\
      \ people with 12-month AUD \nreceived treatment. \nFrom the same survey, any\
      \ 12-month drug use disorder (i.e., SUD not involving alcohol) was associated\
      \ \nwith significantly increased odds of also having a co-occurring mental disorder,\
      \ including 1.3 times the \nodds of having major depressive disorder (MDD),\
      \ 1.5 odds of dysthymia, 1.5 odds of bipolar I disorder, \n1.6 odds of PTSD,\
      \ 1.4 odds of antisocial PD, and 1.8 odds of BPD (Grant et al., 2016). Lifetime\
      \ drug use \ndisorder had similar comorbidities but also was associated with\
      \ a 1.3 increase in odds of also having \nGAD, panic disorder, and social phobia,\
      \ each. Only 13.5 percent of people with a 12-month drug use \ndisorder and\
      \ about a quarter of people with any lifetime drug use disorder received treatment\
      \ in the \npast year.   \nOpioid Use Disorder and the Problem of CODs \nOpioid\
      \ addiction and overdose are a public health crisis and the target of numerous\
      \ federal prevention and \ntreatment campaigns. Among the causes for concern\
      \ is the high rate of CODs among people with opioid use \ndisorder (OUD). Of\
      \ 2 million U.S. adults with OUD in the 2015 to 2017 NSDUH (Jones & McCance-Katz,\
      \ 2019):  \n• 77 percent also had another SUD or nicotine dependence in the\
      \ past year. \n• 64 percent also had any co-occurring mental illness in the\
      \ past year. \n• 27 percent had a past-year comorbid SMI. \nIn terms of service\
      \ provision, 38 percent of people with OUD and any past-year mental illness\
      \ or SMI received \nSUD treatment in the previous year. Mental health services\
      \ were more common, with 55 percent of people with \nOUD and any mental illness\
      \ and 65 percent of those with OUD and SMI receiving care in the previous year.\
      \ \nHowever, comprehensive treatment for both disorders was low and reported\
      \ by only one-quarter of people \nwith OUD and any mental illness and 30 percent\
      \ of people with OUD and SMI. \n2. CODs and Hospitalizations  \nCompared with\
      \ people with mental disorders or SUDs alone, people with CODs are more likely\
      \ to be \nhospitalized. Some evidence suggests that the hospitalization rate\
      \ for people with CODs is increasing.  \nSince the 1960s, treatment for mental\
      \ disorders and SUDs in the United States has shifted away from \nstate-owned\
      \ facilities to psychiatric units in general hospitals and private psychiatric\
      \ hospitals (Parks & \nRadke, 2014). Psychiatric bed capacity has continued\
      \ to shrink over the past few decades in the United \nStates and elsewhere (Allison,\
      \ & Bastiampillai, 2017; Lutterman, Shaw, Fisher, & Manderscheid, 2017; \nTyrer,\
      \ Sharfstein, O'Reilly), despite an upsurge in mental disorder/SUD-related hospitalizations:\
      \  \n• \nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that from 2005\
      \ to 2014, the number of \nhospital inpatient stays for people with mental disorders\
      \ or SUDs increased by 12 percent, and the \nproportion of total inpatient stays\
      \ accounted for by mental disorders or SUDs also increased, by 20 \npercent\
      \ (McDermott, Elixhauser, & Sun, 2017).  \n• \nCODs are also linked to rehospitalizations\
      \ for non-behavioral-health reasons (i.e., for physical health \nconditions).\
      \ Among a large sample of Florida Medicaid recipients (Becker, Boaz, Andel,\
      \ & Hafner, \n2017), 28 percent of people with SMI and an SUD were rehospitalized\
      \ within 30 days of discharge, \nwhereas rehospitalization occurred in only\
      \ 17 percent of people with neither disorder, 22 percent of \npeople with SMI\
      \ only, 27 percent with a drug use disorder, and 24 percent with AUD."

      \  \n \n \nPage 10 \n \n• \nIn the 2000 to 2012 Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS),\
      \ SUD treatment-related admissions of adults \nages 55 and older (Chhatre, Cook,\
      \ Mallik, & Jayadevappa, 2017) that also involved co-occurring \npsychiatric\
      \ problems nearly doubled, from 17 percent to 32 percent.  \n• \nAs reported\
      \ in the 2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (Heslin, Elixhauser, &\
      \ Steiner, 2015), \nalmost 6 percent of all inpatient hospitalizations in the\
      \ United States involved a COD, 21 percent a \nmental health diagnosis only,\
      \ and about 6 percent an SUD only. Of inpatient stays involving a \nprimary\
      \ diagnosis of mental illness or SUD, 46 percent were because of a COD, whereas\
      \ 40 percent \nof inpatient stays only involved a mental disorder and 15 percent\
      \ only an SUD (Heslin et al., 2015). \nHospitalizations and early readmissions\
      \ are costly, potentially preventable occurrences. Identifying \nindividuals\
      \ at risk for either or both (such as individuals with CODs) could inform more\
      \ effective \ndischarge planning and wraparound services. \n3. Trends in COD\
      \ Programming \nSome evidence supports an increased prevalence of people with\
      \ CODs in treatment settings and of \nmore programs for people with CODs. However,\
      \ treatment gaps remain. \nData from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the\
      \ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (Zhu & Wu, \n2018) found that the\
      \ number of people ages 12 and older hospitalized for inpatient detoxification\
      \ who \nhad a co-occurring mental disorder diagnosis increased significantly\
      \ from 43 percent in 2003 to almost \n59 percent in 2011. This included a significant\
      \ rise in co-occurring anxiety disorders (8 percent vs. 17 \npercent) and nonsignificant\
      \ but notable increases in mood disorders (35 percent vs. 46 percent) and \n\
      schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders (3 percent vs. 5 percent). Recent\
      \ survey data (SAMHSA, \n2018e) revealed a significant increase in the proportion\
      \ of clients with CODs in SUD treatment facilities \nfrom 2007 (37 percent)\
      \ to 2017 (50 percent).  \nCOD programming has not kept pace with the increase\
      \ in clients needing such services. In 2018, most \nSUD treatment facilities\
      \ surveyed through the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services\
      \ \n(99.8 percent) reported having clients in treatment with a diagnosed COD\
      \ (SAMHSA, 2019b). However, \nonly 50 percent of the facilities indicated that\
      \ they provided specifically tailored programs or group \ntreatments for clients\
      \ with CODs. The 2018 National Mental Health Services Survey (SAMHSA, 2019c)\
      \ \nreported similar findings: only 46 percent of mental health service facilities\
      \ offered COD-specific \nprogramming. Facilities most likely to offer COD programming\
      \ were private psychiatric hospitals (65 \npercent), Veterans Administration\
      \ medical centers (56 percent), and multisetting mental health facilities \n\
      (59 percent), and community mental health centers (54 percent); among those\
      \ least likely to offer COD \nprograms were partial hospitalization/day treatment\
      \ facilities (37 percent) and general hospitals (40 \npercent). A national survey\
      \ of 256 SUD treatment and mental health service programs (McGovern, \nLambert-Harris,\
      \ Gotham, Claus, & Xie, 2014) found only 18 percent of addiction programs and\
      \ 9 \npercent of mental health programs were rated as COD “capable” (in terms\
      \ of their capacity to \nadequately deliver COD services).  \nThe types of assessment\
      \ and pretreatment services at SUD treatment facilities varied in 2018 (SAMHSA,\
      \ \n2019b), with 96 percent providing screening for substance misuse, 93 percent\
      \ providing comprehensive \nsubstance misuse assessment or SUD diagnosis, 75\
      \ percent screening for mental disorders, and 53 \npercent providing comprehensive\
      \ psychiatric assessment or diagnosis."

      \  \n \n \nPage 11 \n \n4. Complications of CODs \nCODs can complicate treatment\
      \ and, if poorly managed, can hinder recovery. Further, rates of mental \ndisorders\
      \ appear to increase as the number of SUDs increases, meaning people with polysubstance\
      \ \nuse are especially vulnerable to CODs.  \nEpidemiologists have observed\
      \ increasing rates of SUD treatment admissions among people with \nmultiple\
      \ SUDs. Analyses of TEDS (SAMHSA, 2019a) reveal that in 2017, more than 25 percent\
      \ of people \nages 12 and older admitted for SUD treatment reported both alcohol\
      \ and other substance misuse. This \ncould partially account for the increase\
      \ in clients with CODs in SUD treatment settings, as it appears that \nhaving\
      \ multiple mental disorders increases the odds of having multiple SUDs or vice\
      \ versa. In the \nNESARC-III (McCabe, West, Jutkiewicz, & Boyd, 2017), people\
      \ with one lifetime mental disorder had \nmore than three times the odds of\
      \ having multiple past-year SUDs compared with people with no \nlifetime mental\
      \ disorders. But people with multiple mental disorders (particularly mood disorders,\
      \ \nPDs, and PTSD) are nearly nine times more likely to have multiple past-year\
      \ SUDs. Individuals with \nmultiple previous SUDs also were less likely to experience\
      \ remission from substance misuse than people \nwith a single SUD.  \nSUD treatment\
      \ facilities are increasingly seeing nonalcohol substances as the primary substance\
      \ of \nmisuse among people entering treatment. For instance, from 2005 to 2015,\
      \ the proportion of alcohol \nadmissions decreased from about 40 percent to\
      \ 34 percent and opiate admissions increased from 18 \npercent to 34 percent\
      \ (with opiates other than heroin increasing from 4 percent to 8 percent) (SAMHSA,\
      \ \n2017). This and the trend of increased polysubstance misuse are worrisome,\
      \ as NESARC-III data clearly \ndemonstrate both drug use disorders and AUD each\
      \ independently confer an exaggerated risk of co-\noccurring mental disorders\
      \ (Grant et al., 2015; Grant et al., 2016).  \nCODs can be an obstacle to addiction\
      \ recovery, especially when untreated. Data from the 2009 to 2011 \nTEDS-Discharges\
      \ show that, of people admitted to SUD treatment, 28 percent had a co-occurring\
      \ \npsychiatric condition (Krawczyk et al., 2017). Prevalence rates of CODs\
      \ varied across individual states \nand ranged from 8 percent to 62 percent.\
      \ People with a psychiatric comorbidity were significantly more \nlikely than\
      \ those without a psychiatric comorbidity to report using three or more substances\
      \ (27 percent \nvs. 17 percent). Of people who did not complete treatment, 42\
      \ percent had a COD, versus 36 percent \nwithout. This translated to about a\
      \ 1.3 increase in odds of not completing treatment and a 1.1 increase \nin odds\
      \ of earlier time to attrition for people with CODs compared with those with\
      \ an SUD only. \nCODs are strongly associated with socioeconomic and health\
      \ factors that can challenge recovery, such \nas unemployment, homelessness,\
      \ incarceration/criminal justice system involvement, and suicide.  \n• \nAccording\
      \ to SAMHSA’s Mental Health Annual Report, in 2017, 29 percent of people with\
      \ CODs \nwere unemployed and 50 percent were not in the labor force (e.g., disabled,\
      \ retired, student) \n(SAMHSA, 2019e). The current national unemployment rate\
      \ at the time of this publication is 3.5 \npercent (Bureau of Labor Statistics,\
      \ October 10, 2019).  \n• \nOf people 12 and older with CODs, 7.5 percent experience\
      \ homelessness, including 8.3 percent of \npeople with an SUD and schizophrenia\
      \ or other psychotic disorder, 6.9 percent with an SUD and \nbipolar disorders,\
      \ and 7.8 percent with an SUD and depressive disorders (SAMHSA, 2019e). Rates\
      \ of \nlifetime and past-year homelessness in the general community per NESARC-III\
      \ (Tsai, 2018) are about \n4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. The 2017\
      \ Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress \n(Henry, Watt, Rosenthal, &\
      \ Shivji, 2017) found that almost 23 percent of adults in permanent \nsupportive\
      \ housing programs had transferred from an SUD treatment center; 15 percent,\
      \ from a \nmental health services facility. Furthermore, of the 552,830 total\
      \ individuals experiencing"

      \  \n \n \nPage 12 \n \nhomelessness, about 20 percent (111,122) had an SMI\
      \ and about 16 percent (86,647) had a chronic \nSUD (U.S. Department of Housing\
      \ and Urban Development, 2018).  \n• \nOf people incarcerated in U.S. state\
      \ prisons (Al-Rousan, Rubenstein, Sieleni, Deol, & Wallace, 2017), \nabout 48\
      \ percent have a history of mental illness (of whom 29 percent had an SMI);\
      \ 26 percent, a \nhistory of an SUD. Of those with mental illness, 49 percent\
      \ also have a co-occurring SUD.  \n• \nMental disorders that commonly co-occur\
      \ with SUDs are highly prevalent in people who have \ncompleted suicide, including\
      \ depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and \nPTSD\
      \ (Stone, Chen, Daumit, Linden, & McGinty, 2019). Suicide is also a well-known\
      \ risk factor in \nSUDs and a leading cause of death for people with addiction\
      \ (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment \n[CSAT], 2009; Yuodelis-Flores & Ries,\
      \ 2015). In CDC’s National Vital Statistics System dataset (Stone \net al.,\
      \ 2019), 46 percent of all individuals in the United States who died by suicide\
      \ between 2014 and \n2016 had a known mental condition, and 28 percent had problematic\
      \ substance use—of which \nalmost one-third (32 percent) also had a known mental\
      \ health issue.  \nThese figures reflect the need for specifically tailored\
      \ COD assessments, interventions, treatment \napproaches, and clinical considerations\
      \ (e.g., COD programming specific to people without stable \nhousing; COD interventions\
      \ designed for implementation in criminal justice settings). More information\
      \ \nabout how these variables factor into service provision and outcomes can\
      \ be found in Chapters 4 and 6. \nThe Complex, Unstable, and Bidirectional Nature\
      \ of CODs \nCounselors working with clients who have CODs often want to know\
      \ which disorder developed first; the \nanswer to this is not always clear because\
      \ the temporal nature of CODs can be inconsistent and \nnuanced. In some cases,\
      \ it may be obvious that a mental disorder led to the development of an SUD—\n\
      such as someone with long-standing MDD who starts using alcohol excessively\
      \ to cope and develops \nAUD. In other instances, it may be clear that substance\
      \ use precipitated the mental disorder—such as \nsomeone with a cocaine-induced\
      \ psychotic disorder. In many cases, it will be uncertain which disorder \n\
      occurred first.  \nFurthermore, CODs can be bidirectional. For some clients,\
      \ there may be a third condition that is \ninfluencing both or either of the\
      \ two comorbid disorders (e.g., HIV, chronic pain). Environmental factors, \n\
      like homelessness or extreme stress, can also affect one or both disorders.\
      \ Thus, even when it is clear \nwhich disorder developed first, the causal relationship\
      \ may be unknown. Irrespective of the temporal-\ncausal relationship between\
      \ a client’s SUD and mental illness, the two are likely to affect, and possibly\
      \ \nexacerbate, one another. This means that both need to be treated with equal\
      \ seriousness. \nIn addition to inducing a mental disorder, substance misuse\
      \ can sometimes mimic a mental disorder. Thus, it is \nimportant to use thorough\
      \ screening and assessment approaches to help disentangle all symptoms and \n\
      accurately make a diagnosis. Learn more about screening and assessment for CODs\
      \ in Chapter 3. \nCODs are not necessarily equal in severity. Often, one disorder\
      \ is more severe, distressing, or impairing \nthan the other. Recognizing this\
      \ is important for treatment planning and requires a person-centered \nrather\
      \ than cookie-cutter approach to determining diagnosis, comorbidities, functioning,\
      \ treatment and \nreferral needs, and stage of change. There are models to help\
      \ counselors make such decisions based on \nthe severity and impact of each\
      \ disorder. For instance, the Four Quadrants Model (National Association \n\
      of State Mental Health Program Directors & National Association of State Alcohol\
      \ and Drug Abuse \nDirectors, 1999) classifies clients in four basic groups\
      \ based on relative symptom severity, not diagnosis: \n• \nCategory I: Less\
      \ severe mental disorder/less severe substance disorder"

      \ and treatment decision-making processes, see Chapter 3. \nSUDs, Mental Illness,\
      \ and “Self-Medicating” \nThe notion that SUDs are caused, in whole or part,\
      \ by one’s attempts to “self­medicate” symptoms with \nalcohol or illicit drugs\
      \ has been a source of debate. The consensus panel cautions that the term \n\
      “self­medication” should not be used, as it equates drugs of misuse (which usually\
      \ worsen health) with \ntrue medications (which are designed to improve health).\
      \ Although it is true that some people with \nmental conditions may misuse substances\
      \ to alleviate their symptoms or otherwise cope (Sarvet et al., \n2018; Simpson,\
      \ Stappenbeck, Luterek, Lehavot, & Kaysen, 2014), this is not always the case.\
      \ Counselors \nshould not assume self-medication is the causal link between\
      \ a client’s mental disorder and SUD. \nConclusion \nThe COD recovery trajectory\
      \ often has pitfalls, but our understanding of CODs and COD-specific service\
      \ \ndelivery has improved over the past 20 years. Despite these advances, significant\
      \ gaps remain in the \naccurate and timely assessment, diagnosis, and treatment\
      \ of people with CODs. To achieve lower-cost \nmental health services and SUD\
      \ treatment, better client outcomes, and a more positive treatment \nexperience,\
      \ providers and administrators must collectively place more focus on CODs in\
      \ their work. By \nbetter understanding the risks and responding to the service\
      \ needs of people with CODs, behavioral \nhealth service providers can help\
      \ make long-term recovery an attainable goal for all clients with CODs.\n\n\

      \ for Working \nWith People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders  \n(For Counselors,\
      \ Other Treatment/Service Providers, \nSupervisors, and Administrators)  \n\
      Many treatment providers and agencies recognize the need to provide quality\
      \ care to people with CODs \nbut see it as a daunting challenge beyond their\
      \ resources. Programs that already have incorporated \nsome elements of integrated\
      \ services and want to do more may lack a clear framework for determining \n\
      priorities. Addiction counselors might recognize the need to be able to effectively\
      \ treat clients with \nCODs but not fully understand the best approaches to\
      \ doing so. As counselors and programs look to \nimprove their effectiveness\
      \ in treating this population, what should they consider? How could the \nexperience\
      \ of other agencies or counselors inform their planning process? Are resources\
      \ available that \ncould help turn such a vision into reality? This chapter\
      \ is designed to help both providers and agencies \nthat want to improve services\
      \ for their clients with CODs, whether that means establishing services \nwhere\
      \ there currently are none or learning to improve existing ones. \nThe chapter\
      \ begins with a review of general guiding principles derived from proven models,\
      \ clinical \nexperience, and the growing base of empirical evidence. Building\
      \ on these guiding principles, the \nchapter turns to the specific core components\
      \ for effective service delivery for addiction counselors and \nother providers\
      \ and for administrators and supervisors, respectively. For providers, this\
      \ includes \naddressing in concrete terms the challenges of providing access,\
      \ screening and assessment, appropriate \nlevel of care, integrated treatment,\
      \ comprehensive services, and continuity of care. For supervisors and \nadministrators,\
      \ effective service delivery requires staff to develop essential core competencies\
      \ and take \nadvantage of opportunities for professional development. Achieving\
      \ optimal COD programming means \nintegrating research into clinical services\
      \ to ensure practices are evidence based; establishing essential \nservices\
      \ to meet the varied needs of people with CODs; and conducting program assessments\
      \ to gauge \nwhether services adequately fulfill clients’ access and treatment\
      \ needs. \nKey Points \nGeneral guiding principles of good care for people with\
      \ co-occurring disorders (CODs) ensure counselors, \nadministrators, supervisors,\
      \ and other providers fully meet clients’ comprehensive needs—effectively and\
      \ \nethically. \nCounselors should offer clients full access to a range of integrated\
      \ services through the continuum of recovery. \nAdministrators and supervisors\
      \ are responsible for the training, professional development, recruitment, and\
      \ \nretention of qualified counselors and other professional staff working with\
      \ people who have CODs. Failure to \nattend to these workforce matters will\
      \ only further inhibit client access to care.  \nSeveral core essential services\
      \ exist for clients with comorbid conditions, and supervisors and administrators\
      \ \nshould regularly evaluate their program’s capacity and performance to monitor\
      \ their effectiveness in providing \nthese services and correct course when\
      \ needed."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 2—Guiding Principles\
      \ for Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders  \n \nPage 15 \nGeneral\
      \ Guiding Principles \nThe consensus panel developed a list of guiding principles\
      \ to serve as fundamental building blocks for \nworking with clients who have\
      \ CODs (Exhibit 2.1). These principles are derived from a variety of sources:\
      \ \nconceptual writings, well-articulated program models, a growing understanding\
      \ of the essential features \nof CODs, elements common to separate treatment\
      \ models, clinical experience, and available empirical \nevidence. These principles\
      \ may be applied at both a program level (e.g., providing literature for people\
      \ \nwith cognitive impairments) or at the individual level (e.g., addressing\
      \ the client’s basic needs). \nThe following section discusses the six principles\
      \ and the related field experience underlying each one. \nUse a Recovery Perspective\
      \ \nThere are two main features of the recovery perspective: It acknowledges\
      \ that recovery is a long-term \nprocess of internal change, and it recognizes\
      \ that these internal changes proceed through various \nstages. (See De Leon\
      \ [1996] and Prochaska, DiClemente, & Norcross [1992] for a detailed description.\
      \ \nAlso see Chapter 5 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) for a discussion\
      \ of the recovery \nperspective as a guideline for establishing therapeutic\
      \ alliance.) \nThe recovery perspective applies to clients with CODs and generates\
      \ two main practice principles: \n• \nDevelop a treatment plan that provides\
      \ for continuity of care over time. In preparing this plan, the \nprovider should\
      \ recognize that treatment may occur in different settings over time (i.e.,\
      \ residential, \noutpatient) and that much of the recovery process typically\
      \ occurs outside of or following treatment \n(e.g., through participation in\
      \ mutual support programs and through family, peer, and community \nsupport,\
      \ including the faith community). It is important to reinforce long-term participation\
      \ in these \ncontinuous care settings. \n• \nDevise treatment interventions\
      \ that are specific to the tasks and challenges faced at each stage of \nthe\
      \ COD recovery process. Whether within the substance use disorder (SUD) treatment\
      \ or mental \nhealth services system, the provider is advised to use sensible\
      \ stepwise approaches in developing \nand using treatment protocols. In addition,\
      \ markers that are unique to individuals—such as those \nrelated to their cultural,\
      \ social, or spiritual context—should be considered. It is important to engage\
      \ \nthe client in defining markers of progress meaningful to the individual\
      \ and to each stage of recovery. \nAdopt a Multiproblem Viewpoint \nPeople with\
      \ CODs generally have an array of mental, medical, substance use, family, and\
      \ social \nproblems. Most are in need of substantial rehabilitation and habilitation\
      \ (i.e., initial learning and \nacquisition of skills). Treatment should address\
      \ immediate and long-term needs for housing, work, \nhealth care, and a supportive\
      \ network. Therefore, services should be comprehensive to meet the \nmultidimensional\
      \ problems typically presented by clients with CODs. \nExhibit 2.1. Six Guiding\
      \ Principles in Treating Clients With CODs \n1. Use a recovery perspective.\
      \ \n2. Adopt a multiproblem viewpoint.  \n3. Develop a phased approach to treatment.\
      \  \n4. Address specific real-life problems early in treatment.  \n5. Plan for\
      \ the client’s cognitive and functional impairments.  \n6. Use support systems\
      \ to maintain and extend treatment effectiveness."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 2—Guiding Principles\
      \ for Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders  \n \nPage 16 \nDevelop\
      \ a Phased Approach to Treatment \nUsing a staged or phased approach to COD\
      \ treatment helps counselors optimize comprehensive, \nappropriate, and effective\
      \ care for all client needs. Generally, three to five phases are identified,\
      \ \nincluding engagement, stabilization/persuasion, active treatment, and continuing\
      \ care or continuing \ncare/relapse prevention (Mueser & Gingerich, 2013; Substance\
      \ Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration [SAMHSA], 2009a). These\
      \ phases are consistent with, and parallel to, stages identified in \nthe recovery\
      \ perspective. The use of these phases enables the provider (whether within\
      \ the SUD \ntreatment or mental health services system) to develop and use effective,\
      \ stage-appropriate treatment \nprotocols. (See the revised TIP 35, Enhancing\
      \ Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder \nTreatment [SAMHSA, 2019d]).\
      \ \nAddress Specific Real-Life Problems Early in Treatment \nGrowing recognition\
      \ that CODs arise in a context of personal and social problems, with disruption\
      \ of \npersonal and social life, has prompted approaches that address specific\
      \ life problems early in treatment. \nThese approaches may incorporate case\
      \ management and intensive case management to help clients \nfind housing or\
      \ handle legal and family matters. Specialized interventions that target important\
      \ areas of \nclient need, such as housing-related support services (Clark, Guenther,\
      \ & Mitchell, 2016), can also help. \nVocational services help clients with\
      \ CODs make concrete improvements in career goal-setting, job seeking, \nwork\
      \ attainment, and earned wages (Luciano & Carpenter-Song, 2014; Mueser, Campbell,\
      \ & Drake, 2011).  \nFor people in recovery from mental disorders or SUDs, workforce\
      \ participation is not only valuable \nbecause of its economic contributions;\
      \ it also can enhance individual self-efficacy, improve self-\nidentity (e.g.,\
      \ helping people feel “normal” as opposed to “like a patient”), offer a sense\
      \ of belonging \nwith society at large, provide a way for people to build relationships\
      \ with others, and improve quality of \nlife (Charzyńska, Kucharska, & Mortimer,\
      \ 2015; Walsh & Tickle, 2013). A review of the effects of \nemployment interventions\
      \ for people with SUDs found that employment was associated with reduced \n\
      substance use and more stable housing (Walton & Hall, 2016). \nSolving financial,\
      \ housing, occupational, and other problems of everyday living often is an important\
      \ first \nstep toward achieving client engagement in continuing treatment. Engagement\
      \ is a critical part of SUD \ntreatment generally and of treatment for CODs\
      \ specifically, because remaining in treatment for an \nadequate length of time\
      \ is essential to achieving behavioral change. \nPlan for Clients’ Cognitive\
      \ and Functional Impairments  \nServices for clients with CODs, especially those\
      \ with more serious mental disorders, must be tailored to \nindividual needs\
      \ and functioning. Clients with CODs often display cognitive and other functional\
      \ \nimpairments that affect their ability to comprehend information or complete\
      \ tasks (Duijkers, Vissers, & \nEgger, 2016). The manner in which interventions\
      \ are presented must be compatible with client needs \nand functioning. Such\
      \ impairments frequently call for relatively short, highly structured treatment\
      \ \nsessions that are focused on practical life problems. Gradual pacing, visual\
      \ aids, and repetition often are \nhelpful. Even impairments that are comparatively\
      \ subtle (e.g., certain learning disabilities) may still have \nsignificant\
      \ impact on treatment success. Careful assessment of such impairments and a\
      \ treatment plan \nconsistent with the assessment are therefore essential."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 2—Guiding Principles\
      \ for Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders  \n \nPage 17 \nUse\
      \ Support Systems To Maintain and Extend Treatment Effectiveness  \nThe mutual\
      \ support movement, the family, peer providers, the faith community, and other\
      \ resources \nthat exist within the client’s community can play an invaluable\
      \ role in recovery. This can be particularly \ntrue for the client with CODs,\
      \ as many clients with CODs have not enjoyed a consistently supportive \nenvironment\
      \ for decades. In some cultures, the stigma surrounding SUDs or mental disorders\
      \ is so great \nthat the client and even the entire family may be ostracized\
      \ by the immediate community. For instance, \nsome mutual-aid support programs\
      \ are not very accepting of members with CODs who take psychiatric \nmedication.\
      \ Furthermore, the behaviors associated with active substance use may have alienated\
      \ the \nclient’s family and community. The provider plays a role in ensuring\
      \ that the client is aware of available \nsupport systems and motivated to use\
      \ them effectively.  \nMutual Support \nBased on the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\
      \ model, the mutual support movement has grown to \nencompass a wide variety\
      \ of addictions. AA and Narcotics Anonymous are two of the largest mutual \n\
      support organizations for SUDs; Dual Recovery Anonymous is most known for CODs.\
      \ Personal \nresponsibility, self-management, and helping one another are the\
      \ basic tenets of mutual support \napproaches. Such programs apply a broad spectrum\
      \ of personal responsibility and peer support \nprinciples. However, in the\
      \ past, clients with CODs felt that either their mental or their substance use\
      \ \nproblems could not be addressed in a single-themed mutual support program;\
      \ that has changed.  \nMutual support principles, highly valued in the SUD treatment\
      \ field, are now widely recognized as \nimportant components in the treatment\
      \ of CODs. Mutual support can be used as an adjunct to primary \ntreatment,\
      \ as a continuing feature of treatment in the community, or both. These programs\
      \ not only \nprovide a vital means of support during outpatient treatment but\
      \ also are commonly used in residential \nprograms such as therapeutic communities\
      \ (TCs). As clients gain employment, travel, or relocate, mutual \nsupport can\
      \ become the most easily accessible means of providing continuity of care. For\
      \ a more \nextensive discussion of dual recovery mutual support programs applicable\
      \ to people with CODs, \nincluding those structured around peer-recovery support\
      \ services, see Chapter 7.  \nBuilding Community  \nThe need to build an enduring\
      \ community arises from three interrelated factors: the persistent nature of\
      \ \nCODs, the recognized effectiveness of mutual support principles, and the\
      \ importance of client \nempowerment. The TC, modified mutual programs for CODs\
      \ (e.g., Double Trouble in Recovery), and the \nclient consumer movement all\
      \ reflect an understanding of the critical role clients play in their own \n\
      recovery, as well as the recognition that support from other clients with similar\
      \ problems promotes and \nsustains change. \nReintegration With Family and Community\
      \ \nThe client with CODs who successfully completes treatment must face the\
      \ fragility of recovery, the \npotential toxicity of the past or current environment,\
      \ and the negative impact of previous associates \nwho might encourage substance\
      \ use and illicit or maladaptive behaviors. Groups and activities that \nsupport\
      \ change are needed. In this context, clients should receive support from family\
      \ and significant \nothers where that support is available or can be developed.\
      \ Clients also need help reintegrating into the \ncommunity through such resources\
      \ as spiritual, recreational, and social organizations."

      \ Services \nPeer recovery support services typically refers to services provided\
      \ by people with a lived experience \nwith substance misuse, mental disorders,\
      \ or both (or, in the case of family peer services, people who \nhave a lived\
      \ experience of having a loved one with substance misuse, mental disorders,\
      \ or both). Peer \nrecovery support specialists are nonclinical professionals\
      \ who help individuals both initiate and maintain \nlong-term recovery by offering\
      \ support, education, and linkage to resources. Peers also serve as role \n\
      models for successful recovery and healthy living.  \nFor more information on\
      \ peer recovery support services for CODs and the potential role of peer support\
      \ \nspecialists in promoting and maintaining recovery, see Chapter 7.  \nGuidelines\
      \ for Counselors and Other Providers \nThe general guiding principles described\
      \ previously serve as the fundamental building blocks for \neffective treatment,\
      \ but ensuring effective treatment requires counselors and other providers to\
      \ attend \nto other variables. This section discusses six core components that\
      \ form the ideal delivery of addiction \ncounseling services for clients with\
      \ CODs. These include: \n1. Providing access. \n2. Completing a full assessment.\
      \ \n3. Providing an appropriate level of care. \n4. Achieving integrated treatment.\
      \ \n5. Providing comprehensive services. \n6. Ensuring continuity of care. \n\
      Providing Access \n“Access” refers to the process by which a person with CODs\
      \ makes initial contact with the service \nsystem, receives an initial evaluation,\
      \ and is welcomed into services that are appropriate for his or her \nneeds.\
      \ Access occurs in four main ways: \n1. Routine access for individuals seeking\
      \ services who are not in crisis \n2. Crisis access for individuals requiring\
      \ immediate services because of an emergency \n3. Outreach, in which agencies\
      \ target individuals in great need (e.g., people experiencing \nhomelessness)\
      \ who are not seeking services or cannot access ordinary routine or crisis services\
      \ \n4. Access that is involuntary, coerced, or mandated by the criminal justice\
      \ system, employers, or the \nchild welfare system \nTreatment access may be\
      \ complicated by clients’ criminal justice involvement, homelessness, or health\
      \ \nstatus. A “no wrong door” policy should be applied to the full range of\
      \ clients with CODs, and counselors \n(as well as programs) should address obstacles\
      \ that bar entry to treatment for those with either a \nmental disorder or an\
      \ SUD. (See Chapter 7 for recommendations on removing systemic barriers to care\
      \ \nand Exhibit 2.2 for more on the “no wrong door” approach to behavioral health\
      \ services.) \nExhibit 2.2. Making “No Wrong Door” a Reality \nThe consensus\
      \ panel endorses a “no wrong door” policy that effective systems must ensure\
      \ that an individual \nneeding treatment will be identified and assessed and\
      \ will receive treatment, either directly or through"

      \ referral, no matter where he or she enters the realm of services (Center for\
      \ Substance Abuse \nTreatment [CSAT], 2000a). The consensus panel strongly endorses\
      \ this policy.  \nThe focus of the “no wrong door” imperative is on constructing\
      \ the healthcare delivery system so that \ntreatment access is available at\
      \ any point of entry. A client with CODs needing treatment might enter the \n\
      service system by means of a primary care facility, homeless shelter, social\
      \ service agency, emergency room, or \ncriminal justice setting. Some clients\
      \ require creation of a “right door” to enter treatment. For example, mobile\
      \ \noutreach teams can access clients with CODs who are otherwise unlikely to\
      \ seek treatment on their own.  \nThe “no wrong door” approach has five major\
      \ implications for service planning:  \n1. Assessment, referral, and treatment\
      \ planning across settings is consistent with a “no wrong door” policy.  \n\
      2. Creative outreach strategies are available to encourage some people to engage\
      \ in treatment.  \n3. Programs and staff can change expectations and program\
      \ requirements to engage reluctant and \n“unmotivated” clients.  \n4. Treatment\
      \ plans are based on clients’ needs and respond to changes as they progress\
      \ through stages of \ntreatment.  \n5. The overall system of care is seamless,\
      \ providing continuity of care across service systems. This is only \npossible\
      \ via established patterns of interagency cooperation or clear willingness to\
      \ attain that cooperation.  \nSource: CSAT (2000a). \nCompleting a Full Assessment\
      \ \nWhereas Chapter 3 provides a complete description of the assessment process,\
      \ this section highlights \nseveral important features of assessment that support\
      \ effective service delivery. Assessment of \nindividuals with CODs involves\
      \ a combination of: \n• \nScreening to detect the presence of CODs in the setting\
      \ where the client is first seen for treatment. \n• \nEvaluation of background\
      \ factors (e.g., family history, trauma history, marital status, health, \n\
      education, and work history), mental disorders, SUDs, and related medical and\
      \ psychosocial \nproblems (e.g., living circumstances, employment) that are\
      \ critical to address in treatment planning. \n• \nDiagnosing the type and severity\
      \ of SUDs and mental disorders. \n• \nInitial matching of individual client\
      \ to services (often, this must be done before a full assessment is \ncompleted\
      \ and diagnoses clarified; also, the client’s motivation to change with regard\

      \ existing social and community support systems. \n• \nConducting continuous\
      \ evaluation (that is, reevaluation over time as needs and symptoms change \n\
      and as more information becomes available). \nThe challenge of assessment for\
      \ individuals with CODs in any system involves maximizing the likelihood \n\
      of the identification of CODs, immediately facilitating accurate treatment planning,\
      \ and revising \ntreatment over time as the client’s needs change. \nProviding\
      \ an Appropriate Level of Care \nClients enter the treatment system at various\
      \ levels of need and encounter agencies with varying \ncapacity to meet those\
      \ needs. Ideally, clients should be placed in the level of care appropriate\
      \ to the \nseverity of both their SUD and mental illness. \nThe American Association\
      \ of Community Psychiatry’s Level of Care Utilization System (LOCUS) is one\
      \ \nstandard way of identifying appropriate levels of care and service intensity.\
      \ The LOCUS describes six \nlevels of care sequentially increasing in intensity,\
      \ based on the client’s individually assessed needs across"

      \ services,” \n“dual diagnosis capable,” and “dual diagnosis enhanced” is another\
      \ useful perspective in care \ndetermination and decision-making (Chapter 3\
      \ discusses tools to help with treatment placement). \nSeverity and Levels of\
      \ Care \nThere are models to help counselors make treatment and referral decisions\
      \ based on the severity and \nimpact of each disorder. For instance, the quadrants\
      \ of care (also called the Four Quadrants Model) is a \nconceptual framework\
      \ that classifies clients in four basic groups based on relative symptom severity,\
      \ not \ndiagnosis (Exhibit 2.3). The quadrants of care were derived from a conference,\
      \ the National Dialogue on \nCo-Occurring Mental Health and Substance Abuse\
      \ Disorders, which was supported by SAMHSA and two \nof its centers—CSAT and\
      \ the Center for Mental Health Services—and co-sponsored by the National \n\
      Association of State Mental Health Program Directors and the National Association\
      \ of State Alcohol and \nDrug Abuse Directors. The quadrants of care is a model\
      \ originally developed by Ries (1993).  \nExhibit 2.3. The Four Quadrants Model\
      \ \nIII—Less severe mental disorder/more severe SUD \nIV—More severe mental\
      \ disorder/more severe SUD \nI—Less severe mental disorder/less severe SUD \n\
      II—More severe mental disorder/less severe SUD \nChapter 3 offers more detail\
      \ about the four quadrants and their use in comprehensive assessment. \nAchieving\
      \ Integrated Treatment \nThe seminal concept of integrated treatment for people\
      \ with severe mental disorders and SUDs, as \narticulated by Minkoff (1989),\
      \ emphasized the need for correlation between the treatment models for \nmental\
      \ health services and SUD treatment in a residential setting. Minkoff’s model\
      \ stressed the \nimportance of well-coordinated, stage-specific treatment (i.e.,\
      \ engagement, primary treatment, \ncontinuing care) of SUDs and mental disorders,\
      \ with emphasis on dual recovery goals as well as the use \neffective treatment\
      \ strategies from mental health and SUD treatment fields. \nDuring the last\
      \ decade, integrated treatment continued to evolve. Several models have shown\
      \ success in \ncommunity addiction treatment and mental health service programs\
      \ (Chow, Wieman, Cichocki, \nQvicklund, & Hiersteiner, 2013; Kelly & Daley,\
      \ 2013; McGovern et al., 2014), including programs in which \nCOD services were\
      \ combined with supportive housing services (Pringle, Grasso, & Lederer, 2017);\
      \ \nprograms serving people in the criminal justice system (Peters, Young, Rojas,\
      \ & Gorey, 2017); programs \nin outpatient and residential settings (Hunt, Siegfried,\
      \ Morley, Sitharthan, & Cleary, 2014; Morse & \nBride, 2017); TCs (Dye, Roman,\
      \ Knudsen, & Johnson, 2012); and opioid treatment programs (Brooner et \nal.,\
      \ 2013; Kidorf et al., 2013).  \nThe literature from addiction and mental health\
      \ fields has evolved to describe integrated treatment as a \nunified treatment\
      \ approach to meet clients’ addiction, mental disorder, and related needs (Exhibit\
      \ 2.4). \nIt is the preferred model of treatment. Chapter 7 further discusses\
      \ integrated treatment models. \nExhibit 2.4. SAMHSA Practice Principles of\
      \ Integrated Treatment for CODs \n• Mental illness and SUDs are both treated\
      \ concurrently to meet the full range of clients’ symptoms equally. \n• Providers\
      \ of integrated care receive training in the treatment of both SUDs and mental\
      \ disorders. \n• CODs are treated with a stage-wise approach that is tailored\
      \ to the client’s stage of readiness for treatment \n(e.g., engagement, persuasion,\
      \ active treatment, relapse prevention)."

      \ Motivational techniques (e.g., motivational interviewing (MI), motivational\
      \ counseling) are integrated into \ncare to help clients reach their goals—and\
      \ particularly at the engagement stage of treatment. \n• Addiction counseling\
      \ is used to help clients develop healthier, more adaptive thoughts and behaviors\
      \ in \nsupport of long-term recovery. \n• Clients are offered multiple treatment\
      \ formats, including individual, group, family, and peer support, as they \n\
      move through the various stages of treatment. \n• Pharmacotherapy is discussed\
      \ in multidisciplinary teams, offered to clients as appropriate, and monitored\
      \ for \nsafety (e.g., interactions), adherence, and response. \nSource: SAMHSA\
      \ (2009a). \nProviding Comprehensive Services \nPeople with CODs have a range\
      \ of medical and social problems—multidimensional problems that \nrequire comprehensive\
      \ services. In addition to treatment for SUDs and mental disorders, these clients\
      \ \noften require various other services to address social problems and stabilize\
      \ living conditions. Treatment \nproviders should prepare to help clients access\
      \ an array of services, including life skills development, \nEnglish as a second\
      \ language, parenting, nutrition, and employment assistance. Two areas of particular\
      \ \nvalue are housing and work. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion about people\
      \ with CODs experiencing \nhomelessness and Chapter 7 for further information\
      \ about vocational services as a part of treatment.) \nEnsuring Continuity of\
      \ Care \nContinuity of care implies coordination of care as clients move across\
      \ different service systems (Puntis, \nRugkåsa, Forrest, Mitchell, & Burns,\
      \ 2015; Weaver, Coffey, & Hewitt, 2017). Both SUDs and mental \ndisorders frequently\
      \ are long-term conditions, so treatment for people with CODs should take into\
      \ \nconsideration rehabilitation and recovery over a significant period of time.\
      \ Therefore, to be effective, \ntreatment must address the three features that\
      \ characterize continuity of care: \n• \nConsistency between primary treatment\
      \ and ancillary services \n• \nSeamlessness as clients move across levels of\
      \ care (e.g., from residential to outpatient treatment) \n• \nCoordination of\
      \ present and past treatment episodes \nIt is important to set up systems that\
      \ prevent gaps between service system levels and between clinic-\nbased services\
      \ and those outside the clinic. The ideal is to include outreach, employment,\
      \ housing, \nhealth care and medication, financial supports, recreational activities,\
      \ and social networks in a \ncomprehensive and integrated service delivery system.\
      \ \nContinuity of Care and Outpatient Treatment Settings \nContinuing care and\
      \ relapse prevention are especially important with this population given that\
      \ mental \ndisorders are often cyclical, recurring illnesses and substance misuse\
      \ is likewise a chronic condition \nsubject to periods of relapse and remission.\
      \ Clients with CODs often require long-term continuity of care \nthat supports\
      \ their progress, monitors their condition, and can respond to a return to substance\
      \ use or a \nreturn of symptoms of mental disorder. Continuing care is both\
      \ a process of posttreatment monitoring \nand a form of treatment itself. (In\
      \ the present context, the term “continuing care” is used to describe \nthe\
      \ treatment options available to a client after leaving one program for another,\
      \ less intense, program.) \nThe relative seriousness of a client’s mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs may be very different at the time he or \nshe leaves a primary treatment\
      \ provider; thus, different levels of intervention will be appropriate. After\
      \ \nleaving an outpatient program, some clients with CODs may need to continue\
      \ intensive mental health"

      \ but can manage their SUD through mutual support group participation. Others\
      \ may need \nminimal mental health services but require continued formal SUD\
      \ treatment. For people with serious \nmental illness (SMI), continued treatment\
      \ often is warranted. A treatment program can provide these \nclients with structure\
      \ and varied services not usually available from mutual support groups. \nUpon\
      \ leaving a program, encourage clients with CODs to return if they need assistance\
      \ with either \ndisorder. The status of these individuals can be fragile; they\
      \ need quick access to help in times of crisis. \nRegular informal check-ins\
      \ with clients also can help alleviate potential problems before they become\
      \ \nserious enough to threaten recovery. A good continuing care plan will include\
      \ steps for when and how \nto reconnect with services. The plan and provision\
      \ of these services also makes readmission easier for \nclients with CODs who\
      \ need to come back. The client with CODs should maintain contact post-discharge\
      \ \n(even if only by telephone or informal gatherings). Increasingly, addiction\
      \ programs are using follow-up \ncontacts and periodic group meetings to monitor\
      \ client progress and assess the need for further service. \nContinuity of Care\
      \ and Residential Treatment Settings \nReturning to life in the community after\
      \ residential placement is a major undertaking for clients with \nCODs, with\
      \ relapse an ever-present danger. The goals of continuing care programming are:\
      \ \n• \nSustaining abstinence. \n• \nContinuing recovery. \n• \nMastering community\
      \ living. \n• \nDeveloping vocational skills. \n• \nObtaining gainful employment.\
      \ \n• \nDeepening psychological understanding. \n• \nIncreasing assumption of\
      \ responsibility. \n• \nResolving family difficulties. \n• \nConsolidating changes\
      \ in values and identity. \nThe key services are life skills education, relapse\
      \ prevention, mutual support programs, case \nmanagement (especially for housing),\
      \ and vocational training and employment. \nEmpirical Evidence Related to Continuity\
      \ of Care \nA systematic review (McCallum, Mikocka-Walus, Turnbull, & Andrews,\
      \ 2015) investigating the effects of \ncontinuity of care on treatment outcomes\
      \ for people with CODs had mixed results. Operationalization of \ncontinuity\
      \ of care has generally involved linkage of clients from one level of care to\
      \ another and \nprovision of multidimensional services. Positive associations\
      \ reported by some studies included better \ntreatment commitment, reduced violent\
      \ behavior, improved service satisfaction, better generic and \ndisease-specific\
      \ quality of life, and enhanced community functioning. However, there was no\
      \ consistent \nevidence that continuity of care was associated with abstinence.\
      \ \nThe belief that continuous care benefits people with CODs is also informed\
      \ by positive research findings \non continuity of care for addiction populations\
      \ and SMI populations separately. A meta-analysis of \nstudies exploring continuing\
      \ care among people with substance misuse found a small but positive effect\
      \ \non substance-related outcomes (Blodgett, Maisel, Fuh, Wilbourne, & Finney,\
      \ 2014). Continuity of care \nfollowing residential detoxification is associated\
      \ with decreased rates of readmission for detoxification \n(Lee et al., 2014).\
      \ More recently, a continuing care intervention for people in the first year\
      \ of SUD \nrecovery (McKay, Knepper, Deneke, O’Reilly, & DuPont, 2016) found\
      \ a 70-percent adherence rate over 1 \nyear for providing urine samples and\
      \ a mere 4-percent positive urine sample rate (for drugs or alcohol)."

      \ review of international studies examining continuity of care and patient outcomes\
      \ in mental health \nfound wide variability in the research methodology and\
      \ outcomes (Puntis et al., 2015). Of studies \nconducted in the United States,\
      \ continuity of care (in some but not all of the U.S. studies) was associated\
      \ \nwith reduced psychiatric symptom severity, lower risk of rehospitalization,\
      \ improved functioning, \nreduced Medicaid expenditures, and fewer violent behaviors.\
      \ \nGuidelines for Administrators and Supervisors \nThis section focuses on\
      \ some key matters administrators and supervisors face in developing a workforce\
      \ \nable to meet the needs of clients with CODs. Guidelines to address these\
      \ core topics include: \n1. Identifying and providing to counselors the essential\
      \ competencies (basic, intermediate, and \nadvanced), values, and attitudes\
      \ to be successful in COD service delivery. \n2. Offering opportunities for\
      \ professional development, including staff training and education. \n3. Using\
      \ effective burnout and turnover reduction techniques, as these are common problems\
      \ for any \nSUD treatment provider, but particularly so for those who work with\
      \ clients who have CODs. \nCritical challenges face SUD treatment systems and\
      \ programs that aim to improve care for clients with \nCODs. This section addresses\
      \ these challenges by discussing how supervisors and administrators can \nfoster\
      \ more effective COD programming, such as: \n1. Integrating research and practice\
      \ into programming. \n2. Establishing essential services for people with CODs.\
      \ \n3. Assessing agency potential to serve clients with CODs via adequate and\
      \ responsive programming. \nThis section only briefly addresses guidelines for\
      \ administrators and supervisors. More detailed \ndiscussions about workforce\
      \ improvement and administrative matters, including descriptions of \nprovider\
      \ competencies, supervision, staff training, hiring, turnover, and retention,\
      \ are in Chapter 8. \nProviders’ Competencies \nProvider competencies are measurable\
      \ skills and specific attitudes, and values counselors must possess. \nAttitudes\
      \ and values guide how providers meet client needs and affect overall treatment\
      \ climate. They \nare particularly important in working with clients who have\
      \ CODs because the counselor is confronted \nwith two disorders that require\
      \ complex interventions. Essential values and attitudes that inform \neffective\
      \ care for clients with CODs include a desire and willingness to work with populations\
      \ with CODs, \nan appreciation for the complexity of CODs, and an awareness\
      \ of one’s own personal feelings and \nreactions to working with people who\
      \ have CODs. These are discussed primarily in Chapter 8. \nBasic competencies\
      \ include rudimentary, introductory skills all counselors should possess, such\
      \ as: \n• \nPerforming a basic screening and assessment to determine whether\
      \ CODs might exist and, if \nneeded, referring for more thorough and formal\
      \ diagnostic testing.  \n• \nConducting a preliminary screening to determine\
      \ whether a client poses an immediate danger to \nself or others and coordinating\
      \ any subsequent assessment with appropriate staff or consultants.  \n• \nReferring\
      \ a client to the appropriate mental health services or SUD treatment and following\
      \ up to \nensure the client receives needed care. \n• \nCoordinating care with\
      \ a mental health counselor serving the same client to ensure that the \ninteraction\
      \ of the client’s disorders is well understood and that treatment plans are\
      \ coordinated. \nIntermediate competencies encompass skills such as:"

      Advanced competencies go beyond an awareness of the addiction and mental health\

      \ how CODs interact in an individual. This can include: \n• \nUnderstanding\

      Using integrated models of assessment, intervention, and recovery for people\

      \ urgent \nneeds, considering the stage of recovery and level of engagement.\
      \ \n• \nInvolving the person, family members, and other supports and service\
      \ providers (including peer supports \nand those in the natural support system)\
      \ in establishing, monitoring, and refining the treatment plan. \nContinuing\
      \ Professional Development \nGiven the complexity of CODs and lagging treatment\
      \ rates, there is a pressing need for professionals to \ndevelop the necessary\
      \ skills in accurately identifying and managing these conditions. This TIP makes\
      \ an \neffort to integrate available information on continuing professional\
      \ development. Counselors reading \nthis TIP can review their own knowledge\
      \ and determine what they need to continue their professional \ndevelopment.\
      \ More information can also be found in Chapter 8. \nEducation and Training\
      \ \nEducation and training are critical to ensuring professional development\
      \ and competency of providers \nand should take place throughout the continuum\
      \ of one’s formal education and career. Various forms of \neducation and training\
      \ are central to evidence-based, high-quality care for people with CODs, including:\
      \  \n• \nStaff education and training are fundamental to all SUD treatment programs.\
      \ Although there have \nbeen improvements in the past decade, there are still\

      \  \n• \nMany SUD treatment counselors learn through continuing education and\
      \ facility-sponsored \ntraining. Continuing education is useful because it can\
      \ respond rapidly to the needs of a workforce \nthat has diverse educational\
      \ backgrounds and experience. To have practical utility, competency \ntraining\
      \ must address the day-to-day concerns that counselors face in working with\
      \ clients who have \nCODs. The educational context must be rich with information,\
      \ culturally sensitive, designed for adult \nstudents, and must include examples\
      \ and role models. It is optimal if the instructors have extensive \nexperience\
      \ as practitioners in the field. Continuing education is also essential for\
      \ effective provision \nof services to people with CODs, but it is not sufficient\
      \ in and of itself. Counselors must have \nongoing support, supervision, and\
      \ opportunity to practice new skills if they are to truly integrate \nCOD content\
      \ into their practice. \n• \nCross-training is simultaneous provision of material\
      \ and training in more than one discipline (e.g., \naddiction and social work\
      \ counselors; addiction counselors and corrections officers). Counselors \n\

      \ counselors of either field receive at least basic level cross-training in\
      \ the other field to better \nassess, refer, understand, and work effectively\
      \ with the large number of clients with CODs.  \nProgram Orientation and Ongoing\
      \ Supervision \nStaff education and training have two additional components:\
      \ (1) a statement of program orientation \nthat clearly presents the mission,\
      \ values, and aims of service delivery, and (2) strong, ongoing \nsupervision.\
      \ The orientation can use evidence-based initiatives as well as promising practices.\
      \ Successful \nprogram orientation for working with clients who have CODs will\
      \ equip staff members with skills and \ndecision-making tools that will enable\
      \ them to provide optimal services in real-world environments. \nSkills best\
      \ learned through direct supervision and modeling include active listening,\
      \ interviewing \ntechniques, the ability to summarize, and the capacity to provide\
      \ feedback. Strong, active supervision of \nongoing cases is a key element in\
      \ assisting staff to develop, maintain, and enhance relational skills. \nAvoiding\
      \ Burnout and Reducing Staff Turnover \nBurnout \nAssisting clients who have\
      \ CODs is difficult and emotionally taxing; the danger of burnout is \nconsiderable.\
      \ Relatedly, among mental health and SUD clinicians, the effects of working\
      \ with clients \nwith trauma can lead to compassion fatigue, vicarious traumatization,\
      \ or secondary traumatic stress \n(Huggard, Law, & Newcombe, 2017; Newell, Nelson-Gardell,\
      \ & MacNeil, 2016). If untreated, these can \nhave profound negative effects\
      \ on a clinician’s ability to function at work effectively, care for clients,\
      \ and \ncare for oneself (Baum, 2016).  \nIt is especially important that program\
      \ administrators stay aware of burnout and the benefits of \nreducing turnover.\
      \ It is vital that staff feel that program administrators are interested in\
      \ their well-being \nin order to sustain morale and esprit de corp. Most important,\
      \ supervision should be supportive, \nproviding guidance and technical knowledge.\
      \ Programs can proactively address burnout by placing high \nvalue on staff\
      \ well-being; routinely discussing well-being; providing activities such as\
      \ retreats, weekend \nactivities, yoga, and other healing activities at the\
      \ work site; and creating a network of ongoing support. \nTurnover \nThe issue\
      \ of staff turnover is especially important for staff working with clients who\
      \ have CODs because \nof the limited workforce pool and the high investment\
      \ of time and effort involved in developing a \ntrained workforce. Rapid turnover\
      \ disrupts the context in which recovery occurs. Clients in such \nagencies\
      \ may become discouraged about the possibility of being helped by others. Ways\
      \ to reduce staff \nturnover in programs for clients with CODs can include:\
      \ \n• \nHiring staff members familiar with both SUD and mental disorders who\
      \ have a positive regard for \nclients with either or both disorders. \n• \n\
      Ensuring staff have realistic expectations for the progress of clients with\
      \ CODs. \n• \nEnsuring supervisory staff members are supportive and knowledgeable\
      \ about problems and \nconcerns specific to clients with CODs. \n• \nProviding\
      \ and supporting opportunities for further education and training. \n• \nOffering\
      \ a desirable work environment through:  \n− Adequate compensation. \n− Salary\
      \ incentives for COD expertise."

      \ Opportunities for training and for career advancement. \n− Involvement in\
      \ quality improvement or clinical research activities. \n− Efforts to adjust\
      \ workloads. \nIntegrating Research and Practice \nTo be effective, resources\
      \ must be used to implement the evidence-based practices most appropriate to\
      \ \nthe client population and the program needs. The importance of the transfer\
      \ of knowledge and \ntechnology has come to be well understood. Conferences\
      \ to explore “bridging the gap” between \nresearch and field practice are now\
      \ common. Although not specific to CODs, these efforts have clear \nimplications\
      \ for our attempts to share knowledge of what is working for clients with CODs.\
      \ For instance, \nsince 2007, the National Institutes of Health has cosponsored\
      \ the Annual Conference on the Science of \nDissemination and Implementation\
      \ in Health, designed to foster better integration of healthcare \nresearch\
      \ into practice and policy. CODs have been an underrepresented topic at these\
      \ gatherings, but \npresentations on implementation studies in addiction and\
      \ in mental health, separately, likely will still be \ninformative for enhancing\
      \ the use and measurement of research-based practices for CODs.  \nIn the SUD\
      \ treatment field, implementation research has accelerated in response to evidence\
      \ suggesting \nthat the uptake of empirical findings into actual practice is\
      \ lagging (McGovern, Saunders, & Kim, 2013). \nThis lag has persisted despite\
      \ the availability of research supporting the efficacy and effectiveness of\
      \ \nSUD treatment, including pharmacotherapies and psychosocial interventions.\
      \ In mental health, \nsignificant efforts over the previous two decades have\
      \ led to increased utilization of evidence-based \npractices and program evaluation\
      \ strategies to monitor fidelity and outcomes (Stirman, Gutner, \nLangdon, &\
      \ Graham, 2016). But more research–practice partnerships in mental health are\
      \ needed, as \nmany clients still cannot access or do not receive evidence-based\
      \ care. Similarly, within COD treatment \nsettings, more work is needed to provide\
      \ research-based services that are feasible, acceptable, \neffective, and sustainable.\
      \ SAMHSA (2009a) developed an evidence-based practice toolkit to help SUD \n\
      and mental disorder treatment programs incorporate empirically supported policies\
      \ and practices into \ntheir organizations, with the aim of giving clients the\
      \ best chances at achieving long-term abstinence by \ntranslating COD knowledge\
      \ into practice. \nEstablishing Essential Services for People With CODs \nIndividuals\
      \ with CODs are found in all SUD treatment settings, at every level of care.\
      \ Although some of \nthese individuals have SMI or disabilities, many have disorders\
      \ of mild to moderate severity. As SUD \ntreatment programs serve the increasing\
      \ number of clients with CODs, the essential program elements \nrequired to\
      \ meet their needs must be defined clearly and set in place. \nProgram components\
      \ this section describes should inform any SUD treatment program seeking to\
      \ \nprovide integrated addiction and mental health services to clients with\
      \ CODs. These elements reflect a \nvariety of strategies, approaches, and models\
      \ that the consensus panel discussed and that often appear \nin current clinical\
      \ programming. The consensus panel believes these elements constitute the best\
      \ \npractices for designing COD programs in SUD treatment agencies. What follows\
      \ are program \nconsiderations for implementing these essential components.\
      \ Information about designing residential \nand outpatient treatment services\
      \ can be found in Chapter 7."

      \ to Administrators: Recommendations for Providing Essential Services for \n\
      People With CODs \nDevelop a COD program with these components:  \n1. Screening,\
      \ assessment, and referral for people \nwith CODs  \n2. Physical and mental\
      \ health consultation  \n3. Prescribing onsite psychiatrist  \n4. Psychoeducational\
      \ classes \n5. Relapse prevention  \n6. Case management \n7. COD-specific treatment\
      \ components \n8. Continuing care services \n9. Double trouble groups (onsite)\
      \  \n10. Dual recovery mutual-help groups (offsite) \nScreening, Assessment,\
      \ and Referral for People With CODs \nAll SUD treatment programs should have\
      \ appropriate procedures for screening, assessing, and referring \nclients with\
      \ CODs. Each provider must be able to identify clients with both mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs \nand ensure their access to the care needed for each disorder. For\
      \ a detailed discussion, see Chapter 3.  \nIf the screening and assessment process\
      \ establishes an SUD or mental disorder beyond the capacity and \nresources\
      \ of the agency, referral should be made to a suitable residential or mental\
      \ health facility, or \nother community resource. Mechanisms for ongoing consultation\
      \ and collaboration are needed to \nensure that the referral is suitable to\
      \ the treatment needs of people with CODs. \nPhysical and Mental Health Consultation\
      \ \nAny SUD treatment program that serves a significant number of clients with\
      \ CODs would do well to \nexpand standard staffing to include mental health\
      \ specialists and to incorporate consultation (for \nassessment, diagnosis,\
      \ and medication) into treatment services. \nAdding a master’s level clinical\
      \ specialist with strong diagnostic skills and expertise in working with \n\
      clients who have CODs can strengthen an agency’s ability to provide services\
      \ for these clients. These \nstaff members could function as consultants to\
      \ the rest of the team on matters related to mental \ndisorders, in addition\
      \ to being the liaison for a mental health consultant and provision of direct\
      \ services.  \nA psychiatrist provides services crucial to sustaining recovery\
      \ and stable functioning for people with \nCODs: assessment, diagnosis, periodic\
      \ reassessment, medication, and rapid response to crises. If lack of \nfunding\
      \ prevents the SUD treatment agency from hiring a consultant psychiatrist, the\
      \ agency could \nestablish a collaborative relationship with a mental health\
      \ agency to provide those services. A \nmemorandum of agreement formalizes this\
      \ arrangement and ensures the availability of a \ncomprehensive service package\
      \ for clients with CODs.  \nPrescribing Onsite Psychiatrist \nAn onsite psychiatrist\
      \ brings diagnostic, prescribing, and mental health counseling services directly\
      \ to \nthe location at which clients receive most of their treatment. An onsite\
      \ psychiatrist can reduce barriers \npresented by offsite referral, including\
      \ distance and travel limitations, the inconvenience of enrolling in \nanother\
      \ agency, separation of clinical services (more “red tape”), fears of being\
      \ seen as “mentally ill” (if \nreferred to a mental health agency), cost, and\
      \ difficulty getting comfortable with different staff. \nThe consensus panel\
      \ is aware that the cost of an onsite psychiatrist is a concern for many programs.\
      \ \nMany agencies that use the onsite psychiatrist model find that they can\
      \ afford to hire a psychiatrist part \ntime, even 4 to 16 hours per week, and\
      \ that a significant number of clients can be seen that way. A \ncertain amount\
      \ of that cost can be billed to Medicaid, Medicare, insurance agencies, or other\
      \ funders."

      \ for Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders  \n \nPage 28 \nFor\
      \ larger agencies, the psychiatrist may be full time or share a full-time position\
      \ with a nurse \npractitioner. The psychiatrist also can be employed concurrently\
      \ by the local mental health program, an \narrangement that helps to facilitate\
      \ access to other mental health services such as intensive outpatient \ntreatment,\
      \ psychosocial programs, and even inpatient psychiatric care if needed. \nIdeally,\
      \ SUD treatment agencies should hire a psychiatrist with SUD treatment expertise\
      \ to work onsite. \nFinding psychiatrists with this background may present a\
      \ challenge. Psychiatrists certified by ASAM, the \nAmerican Society of Addiction\
      \ Medicine, or the American Osteopathic Association (for osteopathic \nphysicians)\
      \ can provide leadership, advocacy, development, and consultation for SUD treatment\
      \ staff.  \nMedication and medication monitoring \nMany clients with CODs require\
      \ medication to control their psychiatric symptoms and to stabilize their \n\
      mental status. The importance of stabilizing clients with CODs on psychiatric\
      \ medication when indicated \nis now well established in the SUD treatment field.\
      \ (Chapter 7 covers the role of medication in treating \nCODs in more depth.)\
      \ One important role of psychiatrists in SUD treatment settings is to provide\
      \ \nmedication based on the assessment and diagnosis of the client, with subsequent\
      \ regular contact and \nreview of medication. These activities include careful\
      \ monitoring and review of medication adherence. \nPsychoeducational Classes\
      \ \nPsychoeducational classes on mental disorders and SUDs are important elements\
      \ in basic COD \nprograms. These classes typically focus on the signs and symptoms\
      \ of mental disorders, medication, and \nthe effects of mental disorders on\
      \ substance misuse. Psychoeducational classes of this kind increase \nclient\
      \ awareness of their specific problems and do so in a safe and positive context.\
      \ Most important, \nhowever, is that education about mental disorders be open\
      \ and generally available within SUD \ntreatment programs. Information should\
      \ be presented in a factual manner. Some mental health clinics \nhave prepared\
      \ synopses of mental illnesses for clients in terms that are factual but unlikely\
      \ to cause \ndistress. A range of literature written for the layperson also\
      \ is available through government agencies \nand advocacy groups (see Appendix\
      \ B). This material provides useful background information for the \nSUD treatment\
      \ counselor as well as for the client. \nRelapse Prevention \nPrograms can adopt\
      \ strategies to help clients become aware of cues or “triggers” that make them\
      \ more \nlikely to misuse substances and help them develop alternative coping\
      \ responses to those cues. Some \nproviders use “mood logs” to increase clients’\
      \ consciousness of situational factors that underlie urges to \nuse substances.\
      \ These logs help answer the question, “When I have an urge to drink or use,\
      \ what is \nhappening?” Basic treatment programs can train clients to recognize\
      \ cues for the return of psychiatric \nsymptoms, to manage emotions, and to\
      \ identify, contain, and express feelings appropriately. (For more \ninformation\
      \ about relapse prevention and COD services, turn to Chapter 5.) \nCase Management\
      \ \nCODs are complex conditions that affect many areas of a person’s life, including\
      \ his or her physical and \nemotional functioning, vocation/education, social\
      \ and family relationships, and daily functioning. Case \nmanagement is needed\
      \ to ensure clients receive a continuum of support services at the intensity\
      \ and \nlevel needed to meet their service needs and readiness for change. Administrators\
      \ should ensure staff \ncase managers are service providers and advocates for\
      \ the specific needs of clients with CODs. \nAdditionally, programs should offer\
      \ case management that facilitates client transitions from one level of \ncare\
      \ to the next and that is responsive to all recovery-related needs."

      \ Treatment Components \nPeople with CODs face unique challenges compared with\
      \ individuals who have only a mental illness or \nan SUD. For instance, their\
      \ risk of homelessness, incarceration, and recovery relapse are particularly\
      \ \nhigh. Further, symptoms of one condition can exacerbate the other (especially\
      \ if untreated), and \ntreatment components should comprehensively address all\
      \ diagnoses and symptoms. Administrators \nshould ensure program elements speak\
      \ directly to CODs by hiring staff with COD training and experience \nand implementing\
      \ programs adapted to the particular needs of COD populations. (See Chapter\
      \ 7 for \nguidance on adapting various treatment models for CODs.) \nContinuing\
      \ Care Services \nLong-term follow-up is critical to recovery. SUDs and mental\
      \ illness are chronic diseases, and clients will \nlikely face struggles (including\
      \ relapse) long after they leave treatment. Programs have many options for \n\
      providing continuing care, including mutual support and peer recovery support\
      \ programs, relapse \nprevention groups, ongoing individual or group counseling,\
      \ and mental health services (e.g., medication \nchecks). For inpatient settings,\
      \ long-term follow-up should be discussed collaboratively as part of clients’\
      \ \ndischarge plan so clients are fully aware of the supports and services in\
      \ place to help them succeed. \n(Also see the section “Ensuring Continuity of\
      \ Care.”) \nDouble Trouble Groups (Onsite) \nOnsite groups such as “Double Trouble”\
      \ provide a forum for discussion of the interrelated problems of \nmental disorders\
      \ and SUDs, helping participants to identify triggers for relapse. Clients describe\
      \ their \npsychiatric symptoms (e.g., hearing voices) and their urges to use\
      \ drugs. They are encouraged to discuss, \nrather than to act on, these impulses.\
      \ Double Trouble groups also can be used to monitor medication \nadherence,\
      \ psychiatric symptoms, substance use, and adherence to scheduled activities.\
      \ Double Trouble \nprovides a constant framework for assessment, analysis, and\
      \ planning. Through participation, the \nindividual with CODs develops perspective\
      \ on the interrelated nature of mental disorders and SUDs and \nbecomes better\
      \ able to view his or her behavior within this framework. \nDual Recovery Mutual\
      \ Support Groups (Offsite) \nVarious dual recovery mutual support groups exist\
      \ in many communities. SUD treatment programs can \nrefer clients to dual recovery\
      \ mutual support group tailored to the special needs of people with CODs. \n\
      These groups provide a safe forum for discussion about medication, mental health,\
      \ and substance \nmisuse problems in an understanding, supportive environment\
      \ where coping skills can be shared. \nChapter 7 contains a more comprehensive\
      \ description of this approach. \n12-Step Facilitation and CODs \n12-Step facilitation\
      \ (TSF) is a treatment engagement strategy designed to move clients toward participation\
      \ in \nmutual support as a part of their plan for achieving and sustaining long-term\
      \ recovery. Compared with the \naddiction literature, less research has been\
      \ conducted on TSF for COD populations, but early findings suggest \nthat it\
      \ may be helpful in teaching clients with CODs about their illnesses and about\
      \ the benefits of mutual \nsupport program participation (Hagler et al., 2015).\
      \  \nIn one randomized, controlled trial (Bogenschutz et al., 2014b), people\
      \ with alcohol use disorder and SMI were \nexposed to 12 weeks of TSF adapted\
      \ for CODs. Compared with treatment as usual, those in the TSF condition \n\
      were more than twice as likely to participate in 12-Step groups (65.8 percent\
      \ vs. 29.4 percent) and, on average, \nattended more meetings. Although there\
      \ were no differences in substance use between the two conditions, 12-\nStep\
      \ participation was a significant predictor of future proportion of days abstinent\
      \ and drinking intensity (i.e., \nnumber of drinks per drinking day)."

      \ for Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders  \n \nPage 30 \nAssessing\
      \ the Agency’s Capacity To Serve Clients With CODs \nEvery agency that already\
      \ is treating or planning to treat clients with CODs should assess the current\
      \ \nprofile of its clients, as well as the estimated number and type of potential\
      \ new clients in the \ncommunity. It also must consider its current capabilities,\
      \ its resources and limitations, and the services it \nwants to provide in the\
      \ future. Organizational tasks to determine service capacity include: \n• \n\
      Conducting a needs assessment to determine the prevalence of CODs in their client\
      \ population, the \ndemographics of those clients, and the nature of the disorders\
      \ and accompanying problems they \npresent. Data gathered can be used to support\
      \ grant proposals for increasing service capacity. \n• \nDetermining what changes\
      \ need to be made in staff, training, accreditation, and other factors to \n\
      provide effective services for clients with CODs.  \n• \nAssessing community\
      \ capacity to understand what resources and services are already available \n\
      within their local and state systems of care before deciding what services to\
      \ provide. \n• \nIdentifying missing levels of care/gaps in services to help\
      \ programs better respond to client needs.  \nSAMHSA’s Dual Diagnosis Capability\
      \ in Addiction Treatment (DDCAT) Toolkit (SAMHSA, 2011b) helps \nSUD treatment\
      \ systems and programs assess and enhance their capacity to effectively serve\
      \ clients with \nCODs. The toolkit features an assessment measure (the DDCAT\
      \ Index) that provides feedback on \nnumerous program elements critical to implementation\
      \ and maintenance of competent service delivery \nfor CODs. To clarify the guiding\
      \ principles and approaches that optimize COD programming success, \nthese elements\
      \ are further classified into seven dimensions: \n1. A structure that offers\
      \ unrestricted, integrated, collaborative services to clients with CODs \n2.\
      \ A culture that is welcoming to clients with CODs and readily offers education\
      \ about CODs \n3. Use of routine screening, assessment, and diagnosis (or referral\
      \ to diagnosis, if needed) for clients \nwith CODs that takes into account each\
      \ client’s severity and persistence of symptoms \n4. A clinical process that\
      \ includes stage-wise treatment planning; ongoing assessment and monitoring\
      \ \nof symptoms of both disorders throughout the course of care; and numerous\
      \ approaches to \ninterventions, such as pharmacotherapy management, psychoeducation\
      \ and support (for the client \nand for family), specialized interventions in\
      \ behavioral health, and peer-based services \n5. Provision of continuous care\
      \ through collaborative approaches, recovery maintenance strategies, \nand follow-up\
      \ services (including community-based and peer-based services) \n6. Attention\
      \ to staffing needs, such as the inclusion of prescribers; ensuring clinicians\
      \ possess required \nlicensure, competency, and experience; and implementation\
      \ of supervision or other professional \nconsultation processes (like case reviews\
      \ or other formal approaches to staff monitoring and \nsupport) to ensure ethical,\
      \ evidence-based care \n7. Staff training on CODs, including training that imparts\
      \ basic skills and knowledge (e.g., screening \nand assessment, symptoms, prevalence\
      \ rates) as well as advanced training (e.g., specific \ninterventions, including\
      \ basic understanding of pharmacotherapies) \nTrauma-informed care should be\
      \ the standard among all programs providing COD services. Trauma is \nexceedingly\
      \ common among people with co-occurring mental and SUDs and, if untreated, can\
      \ make recovery \nvery challenging. For more information about integrating trauma-informed\
      \ services, like assessments and \ntreatments, into COD programming, see TIP\
      \ 57, Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA, \n2014b),\
      \ as well as Parts 3 and 6 of this TIP."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 2—Guiding Principles\
      \ for Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders  \n \nPage 31 \nThe\
      \ consensus panel suggests the following classification system: basic, intermediate,\
      \ advanced or fully \nintegrated. As conceived by the consensus panel: \n• \n\
      A basic program has the capacity to provide treatment for one disorder but also\
      \ screens for the \nother disorder and can access necessary consultations. \n\
      • \nA program with an intermediate level of capacity tends to focus primarily\
      \ on one disorder without \nsubstantial modification to its usual treatment,\
      \ but also explicitly addresses some specific needs of \nthe other disorder.\
      \ For example, an SUD treatment program may recognize the importance of \ncontinued\
      \ use of psychiatric medications in recovery, or a psychiatrist could provide\
      \ MI regarding \nsubstance use while prescribing medication for mental disorders.\
      \ \n• \nA program with advanced capacity provides integrated SUD treatment and\
      \ mental health services \nfor clients with CODs. Chapter 7 describes several\
      \ such program models. These programs address \nCODs from integrated perspective\
      \ and provide services for both disorders. For some programs, this \nmeans strengthening\
      \ SUD treatment in the mental health setting by adding interventions that target\
      \ \nspecific COD symptoms or disorders and relapse prevention strategies that\
      \ intertwine identification \nof cues, warning signs, and coping skills for\
      \ both disorders. For other programs, it means adding \nmental health services,\
      \ such as psychoeducational classes on mental disorder symptoms and groups \n\
      for medication monitoring, in SUD treatment settings. Collaboration with other\
      \ agencies can aid \ncomprehensiveness of services. A fully integrated program\
      \ actively combines SUD and mental \nillness interventions to treat disorders,\
      \ related problems, and the whole person more effectively. \nThe suggested classification\
      \ has several advantages. For one, it avoids use of the term “dual diagnosis”\
      \ \nand allows a more general, flexible approach to describing capacity without\
      \ specific criteria. In addition, \nthe classification system reflects a bidirectionality\
      \ of movement wherein either addiction or mental \nhealth agencies can advance\
      \ toward more integrated care for clients with CODs, as shown in Exhibit 2.5.\
      \ \nExhibit 2.5. Levels of Program Capacity in CODs \nConclusion \nCo-occurring\
      \ mental disorders and SUDs are complex. They present significant clinical,\
      \ functional, social, \nand economic challenges for people living with them\
      \ as well as for the counselors, administrators, \nsupervisors, and programs\
      \ who treat them. To help address the full range of symptoms clients \nexperience\
      \ and optimize outcomes, providers and programs must understand the components\
      \ of \ncomprehensive, high-quality care for CODs and have plans in place to\
      \ implement core strategies, skills, \nand services. By using treatment frameworks,\
      \ philosophies, and approaches empirically shown to net \nthe best outcomes\
      \ for people living with CODs, the SUD treatment and mental health service fields\
      \ can \nclose gaps in access and treatment so that people with CODs can live\
      \ healthier, more functional lives.\n\n[Page 60]\nPage 32 \n \n \n \n \n \n\

      \ and Assessment of  \nCo-Occurring Disorders  \n(For Counselors, Other Treatment/Service\
      \ Providers, \nSupervisors, and Administrators) \nA serious treatment gap exists\
      \ between the mental disorder and addiction needs of people with CODs \nand\
      \ the number of people who actually receive services. According to the 2018\
      \ National Survey on Drug \nUse and Health, of the 9.1 million U.S. adults ages\
      \ 18 and older who had CODs in the past year, more \nthan 90 percent did not\
      \ receive treatment for both disorders, and approximately 49 percent received\
      \ no \ntreatment at all (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality,\
      \ 2019). Underlying these statistics is \nthe failure of addiction and mental\
      \ health professionals to adequately recognize CODs. \nScreening and assessment\
      \ are critical components of establishing diagnosis and getting people on the\
      \ \nright path to treatment or other needed services. This chapter offers guidance\
      \ to help addiction \ncounselors understand the purpose and process for effective\
      \ screening and assessment of clients for \npossible CODs. It has three parts:\
      \ \n1. An overview of the basic screening and assessment approach that should\
      \ be a part of any program \nfor clients with CODs \n2. An outline of the 12\
      \ steps to an ideal complete screening and assessment, including some \ninstruments\
      \ that can be used in assessing CODs (see Appendix C for select screening tools)\
      \  \n3. A discussion of key considerations in treatment matching  \nIdeally,\
      \ information needs to be collected continually and assessments revised and\
      \ monitored as the \nclient moves through recovery. A comprehensive assessment,\
      \ as described in the main section of this \nchapter, leads to improved treatment\
      \ planning, and it is the intent of this chapter to provide a model of \nKey\
      \ Points \nScreening and assessment are imperative to identifying and treating\
      \ clients with co-occurring disorders (CODs) \nin a manner that is timely, effective,\
      \ and tailored to all of their needs. The assessment process helps fulfill a\
      \ \ncritical need, as most people with CODs receive either treatment for only\
      \ one disorder or no treatment at all. \nMost counseling professionals can initiate\
      \ the screening process, but understanding why, who, and when to \nscreen and\
      \ which validated tools to use are the keys to success. \nThe assessment process\
      \ is a multifactor, biopsychosocial approach to determining which symptoms and\
      \ \ndiagnoses might be present and how to tailor decisions about treatment and\
      \ follow-up care based on \nassessment results.  \nThe 12 steps of assessment\
      \ are designed to foster a thorough investigation of pertinent biopsychosocial\
      \ factors \ncontributing to, exacerbating, and mitigating the client’s current\
      \ symptomatology and functional status. At its \ncore is the client’s chronological\
      \ history of past symptoms of substance use disorders (SUDs) or mental illness,\
      \ \nas well as diagnosis, treatment, and impairment related to these issues.\
      \ Counselors should get a detailed \ndescription of current strengths, supports,\
      \ limitations, skill deficits, and cultural barriers. Identification of \nclients’\
      \ stage of change and readiness to engage in services will inform treatment\
      \ planning and optimize \nadherence and outcomes."

      \ this \nideal. Nonetheless, the panel recognizes that not all agencies and\
      \ providers have the resources to \nconduct immediate and thorough screenings.\
      \ Therefore, the chapter provides a description of the initial \nscreening and\
      \ the basic or minimal assessment of CODs necessary for the initial treatment\
      \ planning.  \nNote that medical problems (including physical disability and\
      \ sexually transmitted diseases), cultural \ntopics, gender-specific and sexual\
      \ orientation matters, and legal concerns always must be addressed, \nwhether\
      \ basic or more comprehensive assessment is performed. The consensus panel assumes\
      \ that \nappropriate procedures are in place to address these and other important\
      \ areas that must be included \nin treatment planning. However, the focus of\
      \ this chapter, in keeping with the purpose of this Treatment \nImprovement\
      \ Protocol (TIP), is on screening and assessment related to CODs. \nScreening\
      \ and Basic Assessment for CODs \nThis section provides an overview of the screening\
      \ and basic assessment process for CODs. A basic \nassessment covers the key\
      \ information required for treatment matching and treatment planning. \nSpecifically,\
      \ the basic assessment offers a structure with which to obtain:  \n• \nDemographic\
      \ and historical information; established or probable diagnoses and associated\
      \ impairments. \n• \nGeneral strengths and problem areas.  \n• \nStage of change\
      \ or level of service needed for both substance misuse and mental illness. \
      \ \n• \nPreliminary determination of the severity of CODs as a guide to final\
      \ level of care determination.  \nIn carrying out these processes, counselors\
      \ should understand the limitations of their licensure or \ncertification authority\
      \ to diagnose or assess mental disorders. Generally, however, collecting screening\
      \ \nand assessment information is a legitimate and legal activity even for unlicensed\
      \ providers, provided \nthat they do not use diagnostic labels as conclusions\
      \ or opinions about the client. Information gathered \nin this way is needed\
      \ to ensure the client is placed in the most appropriate treatment setting (see\
      \ the \nsection “Step 5: Determine the Level of Care”) and to assist in providing\
      \ mental disorder and addiction \ncare that addresses each disorder. \nIn addition,\
      \ there are a number of circumstances that can affect validity and test responses\
      \ that may not \nbe obvious to the beginning counselor, such as the manner in\
      \ which instructions are given to the client, \nthe setting where the screening\
      \ or assessment takes place, privacy (or the lack thereof), and trust and \n\
      rapport between the client and counselor. Throughout the process it is important\
      \ to be sensitive to \ncultural context and to the different presentations of\
      \ both SUDs and mental disorders that may occur in \nvarious cultures (see Chapter\
      \ 5 of this TIP for more information about culturally sensitive care for clients\
      \ \nwith CODs). Detailed discussions of these important screening/assessment\
      \ and cultural matters are \nbeyond the scope of this TIP. For more information\
      \ on screening and assessment for CODs, see \nScreening and Assessment of Co-Occurring\
      \ Disorders in the Justice System (Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services\
      \ Administration [SAMHSA], 2015b). For information on cultural topics, see TIP\
      \ 59, \nImproving Cultural Competence (SAMHSA, 2014a)."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 35 \n \nScreening \nScreening\
      \ is a formal process of testing to determine whether a client does or does\
      \ not warrant further \nattention at the current time in regard to a particular\
      \ disorder and, in this context, the possibility of a co-\noccurring SUD or\
      \ mental disorder. The screening process for CODs seeks to answer a “yes” or\
      \ “no” \nquestion: Does the substance misuse (or mental health) client being\
      \ screened show signs of a possible \nmental (or substance misuse) problem?\
      \  \nAlthough both screening and assessment are ways of gathering information\
      \ about the client in order to \nbetter treat him or her, assessment differs\
      \ from screening in that screening is a process for evaluating \nthe possible\
      \ presence of a particular problem whereas assessment is a process for defining\
      \ the nature of \nthat problem and developing specific treatment recommendations\
      \ for addressing the problem. Thus, \nassessment is a more thorough and comprehensive\
      \ process than screening. \nThe consensus panel recommends SUD treatment and\
      \ mental health counselors screen all clients \npresenting for SUD treatment,\
      \ mental health services, or both for past and present substance misuse \nand\
      \ mental disorders routinely—at least annually. They should also screen clients\
      \ who report \nexperiencing or otherwise show signs or symptoms of an SUD or\
      \ a mental disorder.  \nAdvice to the Counselor: Dos and Don’ts of Assessment\
      \ for CODs \n• Do keep in mind that assessment is about getting to know a person\
      \ with complex and individual needs. Do \nnot rely on tools alone for a comprehensive\
      \ assessment. \n• Do always make every effort to contact all involved parties,\
      \ including family members, people who have \ntreated the client previously,\
      \ and probation officers, as quickly as possible in the assessment process.\
      \ (These \nother sources of information will henceforth be referred to as collaterals.)\
      \ \n• Don’t allow preconceptions about addiction to interfere with learning\
      \ about what the client really needs. \nCODs are as likely to be underrecognized\
      \ as overrecognized. Assume initially that an established diagnosis \nand treatment\
      \ regimen for mental illness is correct, and advise clients to continue with\
      \ those \nrecommendations until careful reevaluation has taken place. \n• Do\
      \ become familiar with the diagnostic criteria for common mental disorders,\
      \ including serious mental \nillness (SMI) (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,\
      \ other psychotic disorders). Also become familiar with the \nnames and indications\
      \ of common psychiatric medications and with the criteria in your own state\
      \ for \ndetermining who is a mental disorder priority client. Know the process\
      \ for referring clients for mental illness \ncase management services or for\
      \ collaborating with mental health services providers. \n• Don’t assume there\
      \ is one correct treatment approach or program for any type of COD. The purpose\
      \ of \nassessment is to collect information on multiple variables, enabling\
      \ individualized treatment matching. \nAssess stage of change for each problem\
      \ and clients’ level of ability to follow treatment recommendations. \n• Do\
      \ get familiar with the specific role your program plays in delivering services\
      \ related to CODs in the wider \ncontext of the system of care. This allows\
      \ you to have a clearer idea of what clients your program will best \nserve\
      \ and helps you to facilitate access to other settings for clients who might\
      \ be better served elsewhere. \n• Don’t be afraid to admit when you don’t know,\
      \ either to the client or yourself. If you do not understand what \nis going\
      \ on with a client, acknowledge that to the client, indicate that you will work\
      \ with the client to find the \nanswers, and then ask for help. Identify at\
      \ least one supervisor who is knowledgeable about CODs as a \nresource for asking\
      \ questions. \n• Most important, do remember that empathy and hope are the most\
      \ valuable components of your work with \na client. When in doubt about how\
      \ to manage a client with COD, stay connected, be empathic and hopeful, \nand\
      \ work with the client and the treatment team to try to figure out the best\
      \ approach over time."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 36 \nIf properly designed,\
      \ counselors can conduct screening processes using their basic counseling skills.\
      \ All \ncounselors can be trained to screen for COD. There are seldom any legal\
      \ or professional restraints on \nwho can be trained to conduct a screening.\
      \ Counselors should work with their program administrators \nto determine how\
      \ often to screen, which tools to use, and who will perform the screening. \n\
      Advice to the Counselor: Know the Basics of Screening \n• What is screening?\
      \ Screening is a simple process of determining whether more indepth assessment\
      \ is \nneeded, often consisting of asking the client basic “yes” or “no” questions.\
      \ \n• Who should conduct screening? Nearly any counselor can screen. Generally,\
      \ no special training is required. \n• When does screening take place? The consensus\
      \ panel recommends all SUD treatment clients and mental \ndisorder treatment\
      \ clients be screened for CODs at least annually. Screening is also needed when\
      \ clients \nreport or exhibit symptoms suggesting another disorder may be present.\
      \ \n• Where does screening occur? Screening can happen anywhere that services\
      \ are offered. \n• Why screen? Screening is a necessary first step to ensure\
      \ clients receive the right diagnosis and treatment. \n• How should screening\
      \ be performed? A variety of easy-to-administer screening tools are available\
      \ and are \nlocated or linked to throughout this chapter as well as in Appendix\
      \ C. \nThe purpose of screening is not necessarily to identify what kind of\
      \ problem the person might have or \nhow serious it might be. Rather, it determines\
      \ whether or not further assessment is warranted. \nScreening processes always\
      \ should define a protocol for determining which clients screen positive and\
      \ \nfor ensuring that those clients receive a thorough assessment. That is,\
      \ a professionally designed \nscreening process establishes precisely how any\
      \ screening tools or questions are to be scored and \nindicates what constitutes\
      \ scoring positive for a particular possible problem (often called “establishing\
      \ \ncutoff scores”). The screening protocol details exactly what takes place\
      \ after a client scores in the \npositive range and provides the necessary standard\
      \ forms to be used to document both the results of all \nlater assessments and\
      \ that each staff member has carried out his or her responsibilities in the\
      \ process. \nSo, what can an SUD treatment or mental health counselor do to\
      \ screen clients? Screening often entails \nhaving a client respond to a specific\
      \ set of questions, scoring those questions according to the \ncounselor’s training,\
      \ and then taking the next “yes” or “no” step in the process depending on the\
      \ results \nand the design of the screening process. In SUD treatment or mental\
      \ health service settings, every \ncounselor or clinician who conducts intake\
      \ or assessment should be able to screen for the most common \nCODs and know\
      \ the protocol for obtaining COD assessment information and recommendations.\
      \ For SUD \ntreatment agencies instituting mental health screening or mental\
      \ health service programs instituting \nsubstance misuse screening, see the\
      \ section, “Assessment Step 3: Screen for and Detect COD.” Selected \ninstruments\
      \ from that section appear in this chapter and in Appendix C.  \nBasic Assessment\
      \ \nA basic assessment consists of gathering key information and engaging clients\
      \ in a process that enables \ncounselors to understand clients’ readiness for\
      \ change, problem areas, COD diagnoses, disabilities, and \nstrengths. An assessment\
      \ typically involves a clinical examination of the functioning and well-being\
      \ of \nthe client and includes a number of tests and written and oral exercises.\
      \ The COD diagnosis is \nestablished by referral to a psychiatrist, clinical\
      \ psychologist, or other qualified healthcare professional. \nAssessment of\
      \ the client with CODs is an ongoing process that should be repeated over time\
      \ to capture \nthe changing nature of the client’s status. Intake information\
      \ consists of, but is not limited to:"

      \ a \nvictim), marital status, legal involvement and financial situation, health,\
      \ education, housing status, \nstrengths and resources, and employment. \n•\
      \ \nSubstance use—age of first use, primary substance(s) used (including alcohol,\
      \ patterns of substance \nuse, and treatment episodes), and family history of\
      \ substance use problems. \n• \nMental illness—family history of mental illness;\
      \ client history of mental illness including diagnosis, \nhospitalization and\
      \ other treatment; current symptoms and mental status; and medications, and\
      \ \nmedication adherence. \nIn addition, the basic information can be augmented\
      \ by some objective measurement (see “Step 3: \nScreen for and Detect COD” and\
      \ Appendix C). It is essential for treatment planning that the counselor \n\
      organize the collected information in a way that helps identify established\
      \ mental disorder diagnoses \nand current treatment. The following text box\
      \ highlights the role of instruments in assessment. \nCareful attention to the\
      \ characteristics of past episodes of substance misuse and abstinence with regard\
      \ \nto mental disorder symptoms, impairments, diagnoses, and treatments can\
      \ illuminate the role of \nsubstance misuse in maintaining, worsening, and interfering\
      \ with the treatment of any mental disorder. \nUnderstanding a client’s mental\
      \ illness symptoms and impairments that persist during periods of \nabstinence\
      \ of 30 days or more can be useful, particularly in understanding what the client\
      \ copes with \neven when the acute effects of substance misuse are not present.\
      \ For any period of abstinence that lasts \na month or longer, ask the client\
      \ about mental health services, SUD treatment, or both.  \nIf mental disorder\
      \ symptoms (even suicidality or hallucinations) occur within 30 days of intoxication\
      \ or \nwithdrawal from the substance, symptoms may be substance induced. The\
      \ best way to manage them is \nby maintaining abstinence from substances. Even\
      \ if symptoms are substance induced, formal treatment \nstrategies should be\
      \ applied to help the client newly in recovery best manage the symptoms.  \n\
      The Role of Assessment Tools \nA frequent question asked by providers is, what\
      \ is the best assessment tool for COD? The answer is, there is no \nsingle gold\
      \ standard assessment tool for COD. \n• Many traditional clinical tools focus\
      \ narrowly on a specific problem, such as the Beck Depression Inventory \n(Beck\
      \ & Steer, 1987), a list of 21 questions about mood and other symptoms of feeling\
      \ depressed. \n• Other tools have a broader focus and organize a range of information\
      \ so that the collection of such \ninformation is done in a standard, regular\
      \ way by all counselors. The Addiction Severity Index (ASI), which is \nnot\
      \ a comprehensive assessment tool but a measure of addiction severity in multiple\
      \ problem domains, is an \nexample of this type of tool (McLellan et al., 1992).\
      \ Not only does a tool such as the ASI help a counselor, \nthrough repetition,\
      \ become adept at collecting the information, it also helps the counselor refine\
      \ his or her \nsense of similarities and differences among clients.  \n• Knowing\
      \ the appropriateness of a tool is also critical. Has the assessment been well\
      \ studied? Is it considered \nvalid and reliable? Is it validated for use in\
      \ the same population as the client? If the answer to any of these \nquestions\
      \ is “no,” that might mean that the results from the assessment are not reliable,\
      \ valid, interpretable, \napplicable to the client, or some combination thereof.\
      \ This is especially true with clients from diverse \npopulations. Race/ethnicity,\
      \ educational background, age, gender—all of these factors affect life experiences\
      \ \nand can affect the answers a person gives to a questionnaire. Wherever possible,\
      \ be sure to use tools that \nare appropriately matched to the client.  \n•\
      \ A standard mental status examination can also collect information on current\
      \ mental health. There are some \nvery good tools, but no one tool stands in\
      \ for comprehensive clinical assessment."

      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 38 \nProvider and client\
      \ together should try to understand the specific effects that substances have\
      \ had on \nmental disorder symptoms, including possible triggering of psychiatric\
      \ symptoms through substance \nuse. The consensus panel notes that many individuals\
      \ with CODs have well-established diagnoses when \nthey enter SUD treatment\
      \ and encourages counselors to find out about any known diagnoses. \nAs part\
      \ of basic assessment, assess clients’ mental health and SUD history by asking\
      \ questions like: \n• \n“Tell me about your mental ‘ups and downs’. What is\
      \ it like for you when things are worse? What is \nit like when things are better\
      \ or stable?” \n• \n“How do you notice using alcohol (or whatever substance\
      \ the client is misusing) affects your \ndepression (or whichever mental disorder\
      \ symptom the client is experiencing)?” \n• \n“What mental disorders have you\
      \ been diagnosed with in the past? When was that, and what \nhappened after\
      \ you received the diagnosis?” \n• \n“What (mental disorder or substance misuse)\
      \ treatment seemed to work best for you?” \n• \n“What treatment did you like\
      \ or dislike? Why?” \nThe Complete Screening and Assessment Process \nThis chapter\
      \ is organized around 12 specific steps in the assessment process. Through these\
      \ steps, the \ncounselor seeks to accomplish the following aims: \n• \nGet a\
      \ more detailed chronological history of mental symptoms, diagnosis, treatment,\
      \ and \nimpairment, particularly preceding substance misuse and during periods\
      \ of extended abstinence. \n• \nGet a more detailed description of current strengths,\
      \ supports, limitations, skill deficits, and \ncultural barriers related to\
      \ following a recommended treatment regimen for a disorder or problem. \n• \n\
      To determine stage of change for each problem and identify external contingencies\
      \ that might help \npromote treatment adherence. \nAdvice to the Counselor:\
      \ How To Make the Assessment Process a Success \nThere are basic steps counselors\
      \ can take to increase the chances of a successful assessment process by helping\
      \ \nclients feel relaxed and open.  \n• First, create a welcoming environment\
      \ by taking an open, nonjudgmental attitude.  \n− SUDs and mental disorders\
      \ each carry their own stigma, and people who have both disorders may feel \n\
      even more marginalized, leading to underreporting or denial of symptoms and\
      \ treatment needs.  \n− Research suggests that some mental health professionals\
      \ possess especially negative attitudes and beliefs \nabout individuals with\
      \ SMI, like psychotic disorders, and SUDs (Avery, Zerbo, & Ross, 2016).  \n\
      − By being aware of personal biases and taking steps to create a warm and open\
      \ environment, counselors \ncan increase the likelihood that clients will feel\
      \ comfortable discussing distressing symptoms and \ndysfunctions, which can\
      \ better inform treatment needs. \n• Use open-ended rather than just “yes or\
      \ no” questions. The former will allow counselors to solicit a greater \ndepth\
      \ of information and will feel more conversational in tone to the client; the\
      \ latter can feel more \njudgmental and detached. Open-ended questions are also\
      \ more thought provoking and can lead the client to \ngreater self-exploration\
      \ and self-awareness. \n• Furthermore, be sure to address motivation by talking\
      \ with clients about their ambivalence toward engaging \nin services. More information\
      \ about motivational interviewing techniques can be found in the update of TIP\
      \ \n35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder Treatment\
      \ (SAMHSA, 2019d)."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 39 \nAssessment steps appear\
      \ sequential, but some can occur simultaneously or in a different order, \n\
      depending on the situation. Providers should identify and attend to acute safety\
      \ needs, which often \nmust be addressed before a more comprehensive assessment\
      \ process can occur. Sometimes, however, \ncomponents of the assessment process\
      \ are essential to address the client’s specific safety needs. \nFurthermore,\
      \ counselors should recognize that although the assessment seeks to identify\
      \ individual \nneeds and vulnerabilities as quickly as possible to initiate\
      \ appropriate treatment, assessment is an \nongoing process. As treatment proceeds\
      \ and as other changes occur in the client’s life and mental \nstatus, counselors\
      \ must actively seek current information rather than proceed on assumptions\
      \ that \nmight be no longer valid. Exhibit 3.1 lists general considerations\
      \ for the assessment of clients with CODs. \nThe following section discusses\
      \ the availability and utility of validated assessment tools to assist \ncounselors\
      \ in this process. A number of tools are required by various states for use\
      \ in their SUD \ntreatment systems (e.g., ASI, [McLellan et al., 1992]; American\
      \ Association of Community Psychiatry – \nLevel of Care Utilization System [LOCUS]).\
      \ Particular attention will be given to the role of these tools in \nthe COD\
      \ assessment process, suggesting strategies to reduce duplication of effort\
      \ when possible. It is \nbeyond the scope of this TIP to provide detailed instructions\
      \ for administering the tools mentioned in \nthis TIP, but select information\
      \ about cutoff scores is included in this chapter (and select measures are \n\
      included in Appendix C). Basic information about each instrument also is given\
      \ in this chapter, and \nreaders can obtain more detailed information regarding\
      \ administration and interpretation from the \nsources given for obtaining these\
      \ instruments. \nThis discussion is directed toward providers working in SUD\
      \ treatment settings, although many of the \nsteps apply equally well to mental\
      \ health clinicians in mental health settings. At certain key points in the\
      \ \ndiscussion, particular information relevant to mental health clinicians\
      \ is identified and described. \nUsing a Biopsychosocial Approach \nBecause\
      \ addictions and mental disorders are complex conditions with multiple contributing\
      \ factors, \nclinicians should conduct assessments using a biopsychosocial approach\
      \ that thoroughly investigates the \nclient’s history and current status in\
      \ a holistic manner. “Biopsychosocial” in this context refers to a \nclinical\
      \ philosophy and approach to care that seeks to understand clients and their\
      \ experience through a \nmedical, psychological, emotional, sociocultural, and\
      \ socioeconomic lens. This is particularly important \nExhibit 3.1. Assessment\
      \ Considerations for Clients With CODs \n• Providers should maintain a nonjudgmental\
      \ attitude while taking a matter-of-fact approach to asking about \npast and\
      \ current substance misuse and mental illness. \n• First asking about past substance\
      \ misuse and mental illness could help clients feel more open and amenable \n\
      to discussing current problems, which people sometimes minimize. \n• Counselors\
      \ should explain to clients why they are asking about substance misuse and mental\
      \ illness and role \nof such information in treatment planning. \n• Self-report\
      \ assessments can be informative, but counselors should gather laboratory data\
      \ and collateral \ninformation from family and friends as needed. \n• Counselors\
      \ should be able to recognize the common demographic correlates of COD, such\
      \ as gender, \nyounger age, lower educational attainment, and single marital\
      \ status. These give counselors an idea of which \nclients may be more vulnerable\
      \ to these disorders and potentially in need of screening and assessment. \n\
      However, these factors should not be used to justify not screening or assessing\
      \ certain people. Screen all \nclients for substance misuse and mental illness\
      \ routinely, as least once per year. All clients who screen \npositive for symptoms,\
      \ functional impairment, or other service needs should be fully assessed. \n\

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 41 \nAssessment Step 1:\
      \ Engage the Client \nThe first step in the assessment process is to engage\
      \ the client in an empathic, welcoming manner and \nbuild a rapport to facilitate\
      \ open disclosure of information regarding mental illness, SUDs, and related\
      \ \nconcerns. The aim is to create a safe and nonjudgmental environment in which\
      \ sensitive personal \ninformation may be discussed. Counselors should recognize\
      \ that cultural matters, including the use of \nthe client’s preferred language,\
      \ play a role in creating a sense of safety and promote accurate \nunderstanding\
      \ of the client’s situation and options. Such topics therefore must be addressed\
      \ sensitively \nat the outset and throughout the assessment process. \nThe consensus\
      \ panel identified five key concepts that underlie effective engagement during\
      \ initial \nclinical contact:  \n1. Universal access (“no wrong door”) \n2.\
      \ Empathic detachment \n3. Person-centered assessment \n4. Cultural sensitivity\
      \ \n5. Trauma-informed services \nAll staff, including SUD treatment providers\
      \ and mental health clinicians, in any service setting need to \ndevelop competency\
      \ in engaging and welcoming individuals with COD. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion\
      \ of \nworking successfully with people who have CODs and establishing a therapeutic\
      \ alliance.) Whereas \nengagement is presented here as the first necessary step\
      \ for assessment to take place, in a larger sense \nengagement represents an\
      \ ongoing concern of the counselor—to understand the client’s experience \n\
      and to keep him or her positive and engaged relative to the prospect of better\
      \ health and recovery. \nNo Wrong Door \n“No wrong door” refers to formal recognition\
      \ by a service system that individuals with CODs may enter a \nrange of community\
      \ service sites; that they are a high priority for engagement in treatment;\
      \ and that \nproactive efforts are necessary to welcome them into treatment\
      \ and prevent them from falling through \nthe cracks. Addiction and mental health\
      \ counselors are encouraged to identify individuals with CODs, \nwelcome them\
      \ into the service system, and initiate proactive efforts to help them access\
      \ appropriate \ntreatment in the system, regardless of their initial site of\
      \ presentation. The recommended attitude \ncounselors should embody is, “The\
      \ purpose of this assessment is not just to determine whether the \nclient fits\
      \ in my program but to help the client figure out where he or she fits in the\
      \ system of care and \nto help him or her get there.” \nStep 4: Determine quadrant\
      \ and locus of responsibility.  \nStep 5: Determine level of care.  \nStep 6:\
      \ Determine diagnosis.  \nStep 7: Determine disability and functional impairment.\
      \  \nStep 8: Identify strengths and supports.  \nStep 9: Identify cultural and\
      \ linguistic needs and supports.  \nStep 10: Identify problem domains.  \nStep\
      \ 11: Determine stage of change.  \nStep 12: Plan treatment."

      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 42 \nEmpathic Detachment\
      \ \nEmpathic detachment requires the assessing clinician to: \n• \nAcknowledge\
      \ that the provider and client are working together to make decisions to support\
      \ the \nclient’s best interest. \n• \nRecognize that the provider cannot transform\
      \ the client into a different person but can only support \nchange that he or\
      \ she is already making. \n• \nMaintain an empathic connection even if the client\
      \ does not seem to fit into the provider’s \nexpectations, treatment categories,\
      \ or preferred methods of working. \nProviders should be prepared to demonstrate\
      \ responsiveness to the requirements of treating clients \nwith CODs. Counselors\
      \ should be careful not to label mental condition symptoms immediately as caused\
      \ \nby addiction but instead should be comfortable with the strong possibility\
      \ that a mental-health \ncondition may be present independently and encourage\
      \ disclosure of information that will help clarify \nthe meaning of any CODs\
      \ for that client. (See Chapter 4 for guidance on distinguishing independent\
      \ \nmental disorders from substance-induced mental disorders.) \nPerson-Centered\
      \ Assessments \nPerson-centered assessment emphasizes that the focus of initial\
      \ contact is not on filling out a form, \nanswering several questions, or establishing\
      \ program fit, but rather on finding out what the client wants, \nin terms of\
      \ his or her perception of the problem, what he or she wants to change, and\
      \ how he or she \nthinks that change will occur.  \nEwing, Austin, Diffin, and\
      \ Grande (2015) developed an evidence-based practice tool for conducting \n\
      person-centered assessment and planning with caregivers of palliative care patients.\
      \ The framework and \nkey approaches they propose could be generalized to other\
      \ health issues—including mental illness and \nsubstance misuse—and offer useful\
      \ guidance for ensuring assessment processes are focused on the \nclient and\
      \ his or her problems, goals, and needs. However, research is needed studying\
      \ the use of their \nframework in people with CODs.  \nSensitivity to Culture,\
      \ Gender, and Sexual Orientation \nAn important component of a person-centered\
      \ assessment is continually recognizing the significant role \nof culture on\
      \ a client’s view of problems and treatments. Cultures differ significantly\
      \ in their views of \nSUDs and mental disorders, which may affect how a client\
      \ presents. Clients may participate in treatment \ncultures (mutual support\
      \ programs, Dual Recovery Self-Help, psychiatric rehabilitation) that also affect\
      \ \ntheir view of treatment. Cultural sensitivity requires recognition of one’s\
      \ own cultural perspective and a \ngenuine spirit of inquiry into how cultural\
      \ factors influence the client’s request for help.  \nDuring the assessment\
      \ process, it is important to ascertain the individual’s sexual orientation\
      \ and any \ngender identity matters as part of the counselor’s appreciation\
      \ for the client’s personal identity, living \nsituation, and relationships.\
      \ Counselors also should be aware that clients often have family-related and\
      \ \nother concerns that must be addressed to engage them in treatment, such\
      \ as the need for child care.  \nFor more information about culturally competent\
      \ treatment, see Chapters 5 and 6 of this TIP as well as \nTIP 59, Improving\
      \ Cultural Competence (SAMHSA, 2014a) and TIP 51, Substance Abuse Treatment:\
      \ \nAddressing the Specific Needs of Women (SAMHSA, 2009c)."

      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 43 \nTrauma-Informed Care\
      \ \nThe high prevalence of trauma in individuals with CODs requires that the\
      \ clinician consider the \npossibility of a trauma history even before the assessment\
      \ begins. Trauma may include early childhood \nphysical, sexual, or emotional\
      \ abuse; experiences of rape or interpersonal violence as an adult; and \ntraumatic\
      \ experiences associated with political oppression, as might be the case in\
      \ refugee or other \nimmigrant populations. The approach to the client must\
      \ be sensitive to the possibility that the client has \nsuffered previous traumatic\
      \ experiences that may interfere with his or her ability to be trusting of the\
      \ \ncounselor. Clinicians who observe guardedness on the part of the client\
      \ should consider the possibility \nof trauma and try to promote safety in the\
      \ interview by providing support and gentleness, rather than \ntrying to “break\
      \ through” evasiveness that might look like resistance or denial. All questioning\
      \ should \navoid “retraumatizing” the client. \nSee Chapter 4 for information\
      \ about trauma-informed care, Chapter 6 for information on women’s \nconcerns\
      \ in CODs, and TIP 57, Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA,\
      \ 2014b). \nAssessment Step 2: Identify and Contact Collaterals (Family, Friends,\
      \ Other Providers) \nTo Gather Additional Information \nClients presenting for\
      \ SUD treatment, particularly those who have current or past mental disorder\
      \ \nsymptoms, may be unable or unwilling to report past or present circumstances\
      \ accurately. For this \nreason, it is recommended that all assessments include\
      \ routine procedures for identifying and \ncontacting family and other collaterals\
      \ (with clients’ permission) who may have useful information.  \nInformation\
      \ from collaterals is valuable as a supplement to the client’s own report in\
      \ all of the \nassessment steps listed in the remainder of this chapter. It\
      \ is valuable particularly in evaluating the \nnature and severity of mental\
      \ disorder symptoms when the client may be so impaired that he or she is \n\
      unable to provide that information accurately. Note, however, that the process\
      \ of seeking such \ninformation must be carried out strictly in accordance with\
      \ applicable guidelines and laws regarding \nconfidentiality1 and with the client’s\
      \ permission. \nAssessment Step 3: Screen for and Detect CODs \nBecause of the\
      \ high prevalence of co-occurring mental disorders in SUD treatment settings,\
      \ and because \ntreatment outcomes for individuals with multiple problems improve\
      \ if each problem is addressed \nspecifically, the consensus panel recommends\
      \ that providers: \n• \nScreen all individuals presenting for SUD treatment\
      \ routinely for co-occurring mental disorders. \n• \nScreen all individuals\
      \ presenting for mental health services routinely for any substance misuse.\
      \ \nScreening content will vary by setting. Substance misuse screening in mental\
      \ health settings should: \n• \nScreen for acute safety risk related to serious\
      \ intoxication or withdrawal. \n• \nScreen for past and present substance use,\
      \ substance-related problems, and substance-related \ndisorders (i.e., SUDs\
      \ and substance-induced mental disorders). \nMental health screening has four\
      \ major components in SUD treatment settings: \n• \nScreen for acute safety\
      \ risk, including for:  \n \n1 Confidentiality is governed by the federal “Confidentiality\

      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 45 \nSafety Screening \n\
      Safety screening requires that, early in the interview, the provider specifically\
      \ ask the client if he or she \nhas any immediate impulse to engage in violent\
      \ or self-injurious behavior, or if the client is in any \nimmediate danger\
      \ from others. These questions should be asked directly of the client and of\
      \ anyone \nelse who is providing information. If the answer is yes, the provider\
      \ should obtain more detailed \ninformation about the nature and severity of\
      \ the danger, the client’s ability to avoid the danger, the \nimmediacy of the\
      \ danger, what the client needs to do to be safe and feel safe, and any other\
      \ \ninformation relevant to safety. Additional information can be gathered depending\
      \ on counselor/staff \ntraining for crisis/emergency situations and the interventions\
      \ appropriate to the treatment provider’s \nparticular setting and circumstances.\
      \ Once this information is gathered, if it appears that the client is at \n\
      immediate risk, the provider should arrange for a more indepth risk assessment\
      \ by a mental-health–\ntrained clinician, and the client should not be left\
      \ alone or unsupervised. \nScreening for Risk of Suicide or Self-Harm  \nA variety\
      \ of validated tools are available for screening for risk of suicide or other\
      \ self-harm: \n• \nC-SSRS is a commonly used, well-supported tool to quickly\
      \ assess suicidal ideation, behavior, and \nlethality in adult and adolescent\
      \ populations (Posner et al., 2011). It is available in over 100 \nlanguages\
      \ and has been used in many settings that serve people with CODs, including\
      \ primary care, \nmilitary hospitals, and the criminal justice system. Screeners\
      \ can be selected based on the setting in \nwhich they are being used, the population\
      \ being screened, and the language needed. Columbia \nUniversity maintains versions\
      \ of the C-SSRS at http://cssrs.columbia.edu/the-columbia-scale-c-\nssrs/cssrs-for-communities-and-healthcare/#filter=.general-use.english.\
      \  \n• \nSBQ-R (Osman et al., 2001) has demonstrated good reliability and validity\
      \ in measuring past suicide \nattempts, frequency of suicidal ideation, previous\
      \ suicidal communication, and likelihood of future \nsuicide attempt in adults\
      \ in inpatient and community settings (Batterham et al., 2015). It is \nsupported\
      \ by SAMHSA as an effective tool for suicide screening and assessment (SAMHSA,\
      \ 2017). \nFor the full instrument with an overview and scoring instructions,\
      \ See Exhibits 3.4 through 3.6, \nbeginning on page 46. \n• \nSome systems use\
      \ the LOCUS (Sowers, 2016) to determine level of care for both mental disorders\
      \ \nand addiction. One dimension of LOCUS specifically provides guidance for\
      \ scoring severity of risk of \nharm.\n\n[Page 74]\nTIP 42, Substance Use Disorder\

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 49 \nFor more indepth discussion\
      \ of how to manage suicidal ideation and behaviors in clients seeking \ntreatment\
      \ for substance misuse, see Chapter 4 of this TIP as well as TIP 50, Addressing\
      \ Suicidal Thoughts \nand Behaviors in Substance Abuse Treatment (Center for\
      \ Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT], 2009). \nNo tool is definitive for safety\
      \ screening. Providers and programs should use one of these tools only as \n\
      a starting point, and then use more detailed questions to get all relevant information.\
      \ \nProviders should not underestimate risk because the client is using substances\
      \ actively. For example, \nalthough people who are intoxicated might only seem\
      \ to be making threats of self-harm (e.g., “I’m just \ngoing to go home and\
      \ blow my head off if nobody around here can help me”), all statements about\
      \ \nharming oneself or others must be taken seriously. Individuals who have\
      \ suicidal or aggressive impulses \nwhen intoxicated may act on those impulses;\
      \ remember, alcohol and drug misuse are among the highest \npredictors of dangerousness\
      \ to self or others—even without any co-occurring mental disorder. \nDetermining\
      \ whether and to what extent an intoxicated client may be suicidal requires\
      \ a skilled mental \nhealth assessment, plus information from collaterals who\
      \ know the client best. (See Chapter 4 for a \nmore detailed discussion of suicidality\
      \ in people with CODs.) In addition, it is important to remember \nthat the\
      \ vast majority of people who are misusing substances will experience at least\
      \ transient \nsymptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental symptoms. Moreover,\
      \ it may not be possible, even \nwith a skilled clinician, to determine whether\
      \ an intoxicated suicidal patient is making a serious threat of \nself-harm;\
      \ however, safety is a critical and paramount concern.   \nPositive Suicide\
      \ Screens \nIf a client screens positive for suicide risk, counselors should\
      \ conduct a suicide risk assessment to \nmore thoroughly determine the client’s\
      \ potential for self-harm. No generally accepted and \nstandardized suicide\
      \ assessment has been shown to be reliable and valid, but most established suicide\
      \ \nassessments contain similar elements. To summarize, assessment should include\
      \ the following: \n• \nAsk questions about the client’s feelings about living,\
      \ such as:  \n− “Do you ever wish you weren’t alive?” \n− “Have you ever felt\
      \ that your life wasn’t worth living any longer?” \n• \nAsk questions about\
      \ specific thoughts of suicide, like:  \n− “Have you ever thought about killing\
      \ yourself?” \n− “Have you been thinking about suicide lately?” \n• \nFor people\
      \ who endorse thoughts of suicide or self-harm questions, ask questions like:\
      \ \n− “Tell me more about the thoughts you’ve been having. What do you think\
      \ about and how often?” \n− “Does anyone else know that you have been having\
      \ these thoughts?” \n−  “Do you have a plan for how you would kill yourself?”\
      \ \n− “What do you think would happen if you decided to kill yourself? How would\
      \ your family and \nfriends react? What might happen to them?” \n− “What things\
      \ in life make you want to kill yourself? What things make you want to keep\
      \ living?” \n• \nFor people who have attempted suicide in the past, ask:  \n\
      − “What were the circumstances of your suicide attempt? What did you do? Was\
      \ anyone with you? \nWhere were you?” \n− “What happened after you attempted\
      \ to kill yourself?” \n− “What were your thoughts leading up to and during the\
      \ attempt?” \n− “How did you feel afterwards?”"

      • \nAlso be sure to ask about risk of harm to others, such as: \n− “Are you\
      \ having any thoughts about hurting anyone else?” \n− “Are there people you\
      \ would want to die with you if you decided to kill yourself?” \nThe provider\
      \ needs to determine, based on the client’s assessment responses, whether the\
      \ risk of \nimminent suicide is mild, moderate, or high. The provider must also\
      \ determine to what degree the client \nis willing and able to follow through\
      \ with a set of interventions to keep safe. Screening personnel should \nalso\
      \ assess whether suicidal feelings are transitory or reflect a chronic condition.\
      \ Factors that may \npredispose a client toward suicide also should be considered\
      \ in client evaluation. Vulnerable \npopulations include (Department of Health\
      \ and Human Services, 2012): \n• \nAmerican Indians/Alaska Natives. \n• \nIndividuals\
      \ who have lost a loved one to suicide. \n• \nIndividuals involved in the criminal\
      \ justice system or child welfare system. \n• \nIndividuals who engage in nonsuicidal\
      \ self-injury (see Section III of DSM-5). \n• \nIndividuals with a history of\
      \ previous suicide attempts. \n• \nIndividuals with physical health conditions.\
      \ \n• \nIndividuals with mental disorders, SUDs, or both. \n• \nIndividuals\
      \ in the lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender/questioning community. \n• \nMembers\
      \ of the armed forces and veterans. \n• \nMiddle-aged and older men. \nAsking\
      \ people about thoughts of suicide does not make them more likely to try to\
      \ kill themselves. On the \ncontrary, asking about suicide displays a level\
      \ of care and concern that can help people with suicidal thoughts \nand intentions\
      \ open up and feel more receptive to help. Counselors should not avoid asking\
      \ such questions out \nof fear that it will “put the idea” of suicide into their\
      \ clients’ minds; this is simply not true. \nCounselors should also be prepared\
      \ to probe the client’s likelihood of inflicting harm on another person. \n\
      Specifically, counselors should ask questions that establish whether homicidal\
      \ ideation, plans, means, \naccess, and protective factors are present. Also\
      \ ask about past experiences and future expectations. \nQuestions can include\
      \ the following: \n• \n“Have you had any thoughts of harming others?” \n• \n\
      “Have you had any thoughts of harming anyone specific? Who?” \n• \n“If you decided\
      \ to harm (name of person), how would you do it?” \n• \n “On a scale of 0 to\
      \ 10, with 0 meaning ‘not likely at all’, how likely are you to harm this person\
      \ in \nthe next week?” \n• \n“What reasons do you have to not harm this person?\
      \ What might stop you from harming him/her?” \n• \n“What else could you do to\
      \ deal with your anger (or name whatever other feelings the client reports \n\
      feeling) instead of harming this person?” \n• \n“In the past, have you had thoughts\
      \ of harming someone that you acted on? What happened?” \n• \n“How might your\
      \ life change if you do harm this person? What might happen to you or to your\
      \ \nfamily? What might happen to this person’s family?” \n• \n“Would you be\
      \ willing to agree to tell someone before you do this?”"

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 51 \n• \n“How confident\

      \ the \nchances you will remain sober? (e.g., use of 12­Step meetings, supports,\
      \ or treatment).” \nScreening for Risk of Violence \nThe U.S. Preventive Services\
      \ Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that providers routinely screen all \nwomen\
      \ of childbearing age for risk of intimate partner violence (USPSTF, 2016).\
      \ Similarly, addiction \ncounselors and mental health counselors should be vigilant\
      \ for risk of victimization among female \nclients, although men too can and\
      \ do experience intimate partner violence and should be screened if \nthe counselor\
      \ suspects victimization. The screener recommended for high sensitivity and\
      \ specificity \n(Arkins, Begley, & Higgins, 2016; USPSTF, 2016) is called Humiliation,\
      \ Afraid, Rape and Kick. This four-\nquestion tool (which has been validated\
      \ only for women) screens for emotional, physical, and sexual \nviolence (Sohal,\
      \ Eldridge, & Feder, 2007). See Appendix C for the tool. \nScreening for Past\
      \ and Present Mental Disorders \nScreening for past and present mental disorders\
      \ accomplishes three goals: \n1. To understand a client’s history and, if the\
      \ history is positive for a mental disorder, to alert the \ncounselor and treatment\
      \ team to the types of symptoms that may reappear so that the counselor, \n\
      client, and staff can be vigilant about the emergence of any such symptoms.\
      \ \n2. To identify clients who may have a current mental disorder and need assessment\
      \ to determine the \nnature of the disorder and an evaluation to plan for its\
      \ treatment. \n3. To determine the nature of the symptoms that may wax and wane\
      \ to help clients with current \nCODs monitor their symptoms—especially how\
      \ the symptoms improve or worsen in response to \nmedications, “slips” (i.e.,\
      \ substance use), and treatment interventions. For example, clients often \n\
      need help seeing that the treatment goal of avoiding isolation improves their\
      \ mood—that when \nthey call their sponsor and go to a meeting, they break the\
      \ cycle of depressed mood, seclusion, \ndwelling on oneself and one’s mood,\
      \ increased depression, greater isolation, and so on. \nSeveral screening, assessment,\
      \ and treatment planning tools are available to assist the SUD treatment \n\
      team (see Appendix C). For assessment of specific disorders and for differential\
      \ diagnosis and treatment \nplanning, there are hundreds of assessment and treatment\
      \ planning tools. The National Institute on \nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism offers\
      \ professional education materials that address screening and \nassessment for\
      \ alcohol misuse, including links to several screening instruments \n(www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/clinical-guides-and-manuals).\
      \ A NIDA research report (NIDA, 2018a) \nprovides broad background information\
      \ on assessment processes pertinent to CODs and specific \ninformation on many\
      \ mental health, treatment planning, and substance misuse tools. The mental\
      \ health \nfield contains a vast array of screening and assessment devices,\
      \ and subfields are devoted primarily to \nthe study and development of evaluative\
      \ methods.  \nAlmost all SAMHSA TIPs, available online (https://store.samhsa.gov/series/tip-series-treatment-improvement-\n\
      protocols-tips), have a section on assessment; many have appendixes with wholly\
      \ reproduced assessment tools \nor information about locating such tools. \n\
      Advanced assessment techniques include assessment instruments for general and\
      \ specific purposes and \nadvanced guides to differential diagnosis. Most high­power\
      \ assessment techniques center on a specific \ntype of problem or set of symptoms,\
      \ are typically lengthy, often require specific doctoral training to use, \n\
      and can be difficult to adapt properly for some SUD treatment settings. For\
      \ these reasons, such \nassessments are not included in this publication."

      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 52 \nFor both clinical\
      \ and research activities, there are a number of well-known and widely used\
      \ guides to the \ndifferential diagnostic process in the mental health field,\
      \ such as the Structured Clinical Interview for \nDiagnosis (SCID). Again, the\
      \ SCID involves considerable time and training. Other broad high­power \ndiagnostic\
      \ tools are the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and the Psychiatric Research Interview\
      \ for \nSubstance and Mental Disorders, but extensive training is required to\
      \ use these screens and they can \ntake 1 to 3 hours to administer. These tools\
      \ generally provide information beyond the requirements of \nmost SUD treatment\
      \ programs and thus are excluded from discussion in this TIP. \nWhen using any\
      \ of the wide array of tools that detect symptoms of mental disorders, counselors\
      \ should \nbear in mind that symptoms of mental disorder can be mimicked by\
      \ substances. For example, \nhallucinogens may produce symptoms that resemble\
      \ psychosis, and depression commonly occurs during \nwithdrawal from many substances.\
      \ Even with well­tested tools, it can be difficult to distinguish between \n\
      a mental disorder and a substance-related disorder without additional information\
      \ such as the history \nand chronology of symptoms. In addition to interpreting\
      \ the results of such instruments in the broader \ncontext of what is known\
      \ about the client’s history, counselors also are reminded that retesting often\
      \ is \nimportant, particularly to confirm diagnostic conclusions for clients\
      \ who have used substances. \nThe next section briefly highlights some instruments\
      \ available for mental health screening. \nMental Health Screening Tools \n\
      MHSF-III \nMHSF-III (Exhibit 3.4) has only 17 simple questions and is designed\
      \ to screen for present or past \nsymptoms of most major mental disorders (Carroll\
      \ & McGinley, 2001). The MHSF-III was developed in an \nSUD treatment setting,\
      \ and it has face validity—that is, if a knowledgeable diagnostician reads each\
      \ \nitem, it is clear that a “yes” answer to that item would warrant further\
      \ evaluation of the client for the \nmental disorder for which the item represents\
      \ typical symptomatology. It has been used as a part of \nintegrated behavioral\
      \ health and physical health services (Chaple, Sacks, Randell, & Kang, 2016)\
      \ and in \nbehavioral health courts (Miller & Khey, 2016). \nThe MHSF-III is\
      \ only a screening device, as it asks only one question for each disorder for\
      \ which it \nattempts to screen. If a client answers “no” because of a misunderstanding\
      \ of the question or a \nmomentary lapse in memory or test-taking attitude,\
      \ the screen will produce a “false negative.” This \nmeans the client might\
      \ have the mental disorder, but the screen falsely indicates that the person\
      \ \nprobably does not have the disorder.  \nThe MHSF-III is scored by totaling\
      \ the “yes” responses (1 point each), for a maximum score of 17. A “yes” \n\
      response to any of the items on questions 3 through 17 suggests that a qualified\
      \ mental health specialist \nshould be consulted to determine whether follow-up,\
      \ including a diagnostic interview, is warranted. \nCounselors should bear in\
      \ mind that symptoms of substance misuse can mimic symptoms of mental disorders.\
      \ \nModified Mini Screen \nThe Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview\
      \ (M.I.N.I.) is a simple 15- to 30­minute tool that covers \n20 mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs. There is considerable validation research on the M.I.N.I. (Sheehan\
      \ et al., \n1998). However, a modified version of the M.I.N.I.—the Modified\
      \ Mini Screen (MMS)—that contains \nonly 22 items can be used to even more quickly\
      \ screen for mental disorder problems in three diagnostic \nareas: mood disorders,\
      \ anxiety disorders, and psychotic disorders. The MMS has been validated for\
      \ use\n\n[Page 81]\nTIP 42, Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People With\

      \ & McGinley (2000). Reprinted with permission. \nASI \nThe ASI (McLellan et\
      \ al., 1992) does not screen for mental disorders and provides only a low­power\
      \ \nscreen for generic mental condition concerns. Use of the ASI ranges widely,\
      \ with some SUD treatment \nprograms using a scaled­down approach to gather\
      \ basic information about a client’s alcohol use, drug \nuse, legal status,\
      \ employment, family/social, medical, and psychiatric status, to an indepth\
      \ assessment \nand treatment planning instrument to be administered by a trained\
      \ interviewer who makes complex \njudgments about the client’s presentation\
      \ and ASI­taking attitudes. Counselors can be trained to make \nclinical judgments\
      \ about how the client comes across, how genuine and legitimate the client’s\
      \ way of \nresponding seems, whether there are any safety or self­harm concerns\
      \ requiring further investigation, \nand where the client falls on a nine-point\
      \ scale for each dimension.  \nWith about 200 items, the ASI is a low­power\
      \ instrument with a broad range, covering the seven areas \nmentioned previously\
      \ and requiring about 1 hour to complete. Development of and research into the\
      \ \nASI continues, including training programs, computerization, and critical\
      \ analyses. It is a public domain \ndocument that has been used widely for two\
      \ decades. It has been found to be effective in predicting \ninpatient psychiatric\
      \ admissions among people seeking SUD treatment (Drymalski & Nunley, 2016).\
      \  \nDSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure \nAmong the major revisions to DSM-5\
      \ was the inclusion of a newly developed patient assessment tool to \nhelp providers\
      \ screen for common mental disorders and symptoms in need of treatment, including\
      \ \nmajor depression, generalized anxiety, mania, somatic conditions, sleep\
      \ disturbance, cognitive \ndysfunction, and substance misuse. The DSM-5 Cross-Cutting\
      \ Symptom Measure includes 23 items that \ncorrespond to diagnostic categories\
      \ in DSM-5 (e.g., depressive disorders, psychotic disorders) or to \nspecific\
      \ symptom domains (e.g., mania, anger, suicidal ideation).  \nBecause the screener\
      \ is included in DSM-5’s Section III for “emerging measures,” meaning it requires\
      \ \nfurther research before being implemented in routine clinical practice,\
      \ there is little known about its \nvalidation. And no published studies to\
      \ date have examined its use with COD populations. Nonetheless, \nthe measure\
      \ is worthy of consideration, especially in research settings. It is available\
      \ online with scoring \ninformation (www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-\n\

      \ to remember that if the client acknowledges a past substance problem but \n\
      states that it is now resolved, assessment is still required. Careful exploration\
      \ of what current \nstrategies the individual is using to prevent relapse is\
      \ warranted. Such information can help ensure that \nthose strategies continue\
      \ while the individual is focusing on mental health services. \nScreening for\
      \ the presence of substance misuse involves four components, which are: \n•\
      \ \nSubstance misuse symptom checklists. \n• \nSubstance misuse severity assessment.\
      \ \n• \nFormal screening tools that work around denial. \n• \nScreening of urine,\
      \ saliva, or hair samples. \nSymptom Checklists \nChecklists address common\
      \ categories of substances, problems associated with use, and a history of \n\
      meeting SUD criteria for that substance. Overly detailed checklists are unhelpful;\
      \ they lose value as \nsimple screening tools. It is helpful to remember to\
      \ include misuse of over-the-counter medication (e.g., \ncold medications) and\
      \ of prescribed medication. Some checklists also screen for behavioral addictions\
      \ \nsuch as gambling as well as compulsive sexual behavior, Internet addiction,\
      \ and compulsive spending. \nSeverity Assessment \nIt is useful to monitor the\
      \ severity of an SUD (if present). This process can begin with simple questions\
      \ \nabout past or present diagnosis of an SUD and the client’s experience of\
      \ associated difficulties. DSM-5 \noffers guidance on assessing SUD severity\
      \ based on symptom count. Specifically, 2 to 3 symptoms would \nbe considered\
      \ a mild SUD, 4 or 5 a moderate SUD, and 6 or more a severe SUD (American Psychiatric\
      \ \nAssociation [APA], 2013). Some programs may use formal SUD diagnostic tools;\
      \ others use the ASI \n(McLellan et al., 1992) or similar instruments, even\
      \ in the mental health setting.  \nScreening and Intoxication/Withdrawal \n\
      Counselors cannot formally screen or assess clients who are actively intoxicated.\
      \ If clients obviously are \nintoxicated, treat them with empathy and firmness,\
      \ and ensure their physical safety.  \nIf clients report that they are experiencing\
      \ withdrawal, or appear to be exhibiting signs of withdrawal, formal \nwithdrawal\
      \ scales can help even inexperienced providers gather information from which\
      \ medically trained \npersonnel can determine if medical intervention is required.\
      \ Such tools include the Clinical Institute Withdrawal \nAssessment of Alcohol\
      \ Scale, Revised (Sullivan, Sykora, Schneiderman, Naranjo, & Sellers, 1989)\
      \ for alcohol \nwithdrawal and the Clinical Institute Narcotic Assessment (Zilm\
      \ & Sellers, 1978) for opioid withdrawal. These are \nincluded in Appendix C."

      \ Tools \nAUDIT and AUDIT-C \nThe AUDIT (Babor, Higgins-Biddle, Saunders, &\
      \ Monteiro, 2001) and its abbreviated version, the AUDIT-C \n(Bush, Kivlahan,\
      \ McDonell, Fihn, & Bradley, 1998), have been validated for use in screening\
      \ adults at risk \nfor alcohol misuse (Dawson, Smith, Saha, Rubinsky, & Grant,\
      \ 2012; Johnson, Lee, Vinson, & Seale, 2013). \nThese instruments measure current\
      \ alcohol use, drinking behaviors, and consequences of drinking. Cutoff \nscores\
      \ suggesting hazardous alcohol use are 8 or higher on the AUDIT (Babor et al.,\
      \ 2001) and 3 or higher \non the AUDIT-C for SUD or heavy drinking (Bush et\
      \ al., 1998). Both measures are in Appendix C. \nCAGE-AID \nThe CAGE-AID (Cut\
      \ Down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener—Adapted to Include Drugs) is a variation\
      \ of the \nfour-question CAGE screener, which is focused solely on detecting\
      \ alcohol misuse. The CAGE-AID instead \nscreens for drug use and alcohol misuse.\
      \ It is brief, valid, and reliable (Mdege & Lang, 2011), and \nrecommended by\
      \ the USPSTF and others for substance misuse screening, particularly in primary\
      \ care \npopulations (Halloran, 2013; Lanier & Ko, 2008). Respondents who endorse\
      \ 1 or more items on the \nCAGE-AID should be considered for full assessment\
      \ of substance misuse. The CAGE-AID is online at \nhttps://www.hiv.uw.edu/page/substance-use/cage-aid.\
      \ \nNIDA-Modified ASSIST  \nWHO’s ASSIST tool (WHO ASSIST Working Group, 2002)\
      \ is an effective measure for lifetime and current \nsubstance misuse, but its\
      \ length and complex computer scoring system have hindered its widespread \n\
      adoption. NIDA developed an abbreviated version called the NIDA-Modified ASSIST,\
      \ which is \nrecommended by APA for use with DSM-5 (NIDA, 2015) and is recommended\
      \ for primary care as well as \ngeneral medical populations (NIDA, 2012; Zgierska,\
      \ Amaza, Brown, Mundt, & Fleming, 2014).  \nThe NIDA-Modified ASSIST can be\
      \ completed online (www.drugabuse.gov/nmassist/) or on paper. It \nopens with\
      \ a Quick Screen to determine if further assessment is warranted. If the client\
      \ answers “yes” \nto any of the questions on the Quick Screen, the full NIDA-Modified\
      \ ASSIST should be administered.  \nDAST-10 \nThe DAST-10 (Skinner, 1982) is\
      \ a moderately-to-highly reliable and valid measure that has been widely \n\
      used in practice and research (Mdege & Lang, 2011; Yudko, Lozhkina, & Fouts,\
      \ 2007). It assesses past-\nyear use of substances other than alcohol and can\
      \ be administered quickly. Scores of 3 or higher warrant \nconsideration of\
      \ further assessment for a possible SUD (Skinner, 1982). The DAST-10 can be\
      \ accessed \nonline (https://www.hiv.uw.edu/page/substance-use/dast-10). \n\
      MAST \nThe MAST (Selzer, 1971) is a widely used self-report screening tool for\
      \ problematic substance use. A \nsystematic review of its psychometric properties\
      \ suggests the MAST is moderate to robust in reliability \nand validity (Minnich,\
      \ Erford, Bardhoshi, & Atalay, 2018).  \nThis 25-item measure asks about lifetime\
      \ alcohol use and consequences. It takes 8 to 10 minutes to \ncomplete. A score\
      \ of 0 to 3 suggests no drinking problems. A score of 4 suggests early or moderate\
      \ \nproblems. A score of 5 or higher indicates problem drinking and warrants\
      \ further assessment. See \nAppendix C for the measure."

      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 57 \nSSI-SA  \nDeveloped\
      \ by CSAT, the SSI-SA (CSAT, 1994) screens for alcohol consumption and other\
      \ substance use, \npreoccupation and loss of control, negative consequences\
      \ of substance use, problem recognition, and \ntolerance and withdrawal. The\
      \ SSI-SA has strong psychometric properties (Boothroyd, Peters, \nArmstrong,\
      \ Rynearson-Moody, & Caudy, 2015) and includes items drawn from existing validated\
      \ \nsubstance screeners, including the AUDIT, CAGE, DAST, and MAST. It is often\
      \ used in criminal justice \nsettings (SAMHSA, 2015b) but also has been found\
      \ effective in hospital settings (Mdege & Lang, 2011). A \nscore of 4 or higher\
      \ is considered indicative of moderate to high risk of substance misuse and\
      \ warrants \nfurther assessment (Boothroyd et al., 2015). See Appendix C for\
      \ this instrument. \nTrauma Screening \nTrauma refers to an event or circumstance\
      \ experienced, witnessed, or learned of by an individual that \nhas a protracted,\
      \ negative influence on his or her physical, emotional, psychological, social,\
      \ spiritual, or \nfunctional well-being. Common traumatic events include childhood\
      \ maltreatment (e.g., physical, sexual, \nor emotional abuse; neglect); being\
      \ a victim of physical or sexual assault; experiencing a terrorist event, \n\
      natural or man-made disaster, accident, fire, or mass casualty event; repeatedly\
      \ being exposed to \ndetails of horrific or violent events (e.g., first responders\
      \ seeing injured or dead victims, police officials \nrepeatedly hearing details\
      \ about child abuse); or learning that something extremely disturbing \nhappened\
      \ to a loved one or close friend (e.g., learning that your child has died).\
      \ \nTrauma is common in individuals with SUDs, mental disorders, or both, particularly\
      \ women and military \npopulations (Berenz & Coffey, 2012; Carter, Capone, &\
      \ Short, 2011; Gilmore et al., 2016; Kline et al., \n2014; Konkoly Thege et\
      \ al., 2017; Mandavia, Robinson, Bradley, Ressler, & Powers, 2016; Mason & Du\
      \ \nMont, 2015; Palmer et al., 2016; Vest, Hoopsick, Homish, Daws, & Homish,\
      \ 2018; Walsh, McLaughlin, \nHamilton, & Keyes, 2017; see also Chapter 4 for\
      \ more discussion). To determine whether trauma \nscreening is warranted, counselors\
      \ can ask clients about past traumatizing events directly or use a \nstructured\
      \ tool, like the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study Score Calculator (available\
      \ online at \nhttps://acestoohigh.com/got-your-ace-score/). In screening for\
      \ a history of trauma or obtaining a \npreliminary diagnosis of PTSD, asking\
      \ clients to describe traumatic events in detail can be traumatizing. \nLimit\
      \ questioning to very brief and general questions, such as “Have you ever experienced\
      \ childhood \nphysical abuse? Sexual abuse? A serious accident? Violence or\
      \ the threat of it? Have there been \nexperiences in your life that were so\
      \ traumatic they left you unable to cope with day-to-day life?”  \nTo screen\
      \ for PTSD, assuming the client has a positive trauma history, consider using\
      \ these scales: \n• \nThe Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (Prins et al.,\
      \ 2015) and administration and scoring \ninformation are available online (www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/documents/pc-ptsd5-\n\
      screen.pdf).  \n• \nThe PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (Weathers et al., 2013) and\
      \ administration and scoring information \nare available online (www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/documents/PCL-5_Standard.pdf).\
      \  \nSee TIP 57, Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA,\
      \ 2014b), for more indepth \ndiscussion of screening, assessment, and management\
      \ of trauma in behavioral health populations. \nValuable guidance about counseling\

      \ \nCategory/Quadrant I: This quadrant includes individuals with low-severity\
      \ substance misuse and \nlow-severity mental disorders. These low-severity individuals\
      \ can be accommodated in \nintermediate outpatient settings of either mental\
      \ disorder or chemical dependency programs, with \nconsultation or collaboration\
      \ between settings if needed. Alternatively, some people will be \nidentified\
      \ and managed in primary care settings with consultation from mental health\
      \ service or \nSUD treatment providers.  \n• \nQuadrant II: This quadrant includes\
      \ individuals with high-severity mental disorders who are \nusually identified\
      \ as priority clients within the mental health system and who also have low-\n\
      severity SUDs (e.g., SUD in remission or partial remission). These individuals\
      \ ordinarily receive \ncontinuing care in the mental health system and are likely\
      \ to be well served in a variety of \nintermediate-level mental health programs\
      \ using integrated case management.  \n• \nQuadrant III: This quadrant includes\
      \ individuals who have severe SUDs and low- or moderate-\nseverity mental disorders.\
      \ They are generally well accommodated in intermediate-level SUD \ntreatment\
      \ programs. In some cases, there is a need for coordination and collaboration\
      \ with \naffiliated mental health programs to provide ongoing treatment of the\
      \ mental disorders.  \n• \nQuadrant IV: Quadrant IV has two subgroups. One includes\
      \ people with serious, persistent mental \nillness (SPMI) who also have severe\
      \ and unstable SUDs. The other includes people with severe and \nunstable SUDs\
      \ and severe and unstable behavioral problems (e.g., violence, suicidality)\
      \ who do not \n(yet) meet criteria for SPMI. These individuals require intensive,\
      \ comprehensive, and integrated \nservices for both their SUDs and mental disorders.\
      \ The locus of treatment can be specialized \nresidential SUD treatment programs\
      \ such as modified therapeutic communities in state hospitals, \njails, or even\
      \ in settings that provide acute care such as emergency departments (EDs). \n\
      The quadrants of care were derived from a conference, the National Dialogue\
      \ on Co-Occurring Mental \nHealth and Substance Abuse Disorders, supported by\
      \ SAMHSA and two of its centers—CSAT and the \nCenter for Mental Health Services—and\
      \ co-sponsored by the National Association of State Mental \nHealth Program\
      \ Directors (NASMHPD) and the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug\
      \ Abuse \nExhibit 3.8. Level of Care Quadrants"

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 59 \nDirectors (NASADAD).\
      \ The quadrants of care model was originally developed by Ries (1993) and used\
      \ by \nthe State of New York (NASMHPD & NASADAD, 1999; see also Rosenthal, 1992).\
      \ It has two distinct uses: \n• \nTo help conceptualize an individual client’s\
      \ treatment and to guide improvements in system \nintegration (for example,\
      \ if the client has acute psychosis and is known to the treatment staff to \n\
      have a history of alcohol use disorder (AUD), the client will clearly fall into\
      \ Category IV—that is, \nsevere mental disorder and severe SUD). However, the\
      \ severity of the client’s needs, diagnosis, \nsymptoms, and impairments all\
      \ determine level of care placement. \n• \nTo guide improvements in systems\
      \ integration, including efficient allocation of resources.  \nThe model is\
      \ considered valid, reliable, and feasible (McDonell et al., 2012), which is\
      \ particularly \nbeneficial for clients with CODs given that conditions tend\
      \ to fluctuate over time, underscoring the need \nfor a stable framework that\
      \ can accurately classify individuals and capture their potential treatment\
      \ \nneeds throughout the course of their illnesses. \nStep 2 will collect most\
      \ information necessary to make this determination, but there will sometimes\
      \ be \nadditional nuances to consider. Certain states formally specify procedures\
      \ for quadrant determination. \nIn the absence of formal procedures, SUD treatment\
      \ providers in any setting can follow Exhibit 3.5.  \nDetermination of SMI Status\
      \ \nEvery state mental health system has developed a set of specific criteria\
      \ for determining who can be \nconsidered seriously mentally ill and therefore\
      \ eligible to be considered a mental health priority client. \nThese criteria\
      \ are based on combinations of specific diagnoses, severity of disability, and\
      \ duration of \ndisability (usually 6 months to 1 year). Some require that the\
      \ condition be independent of an SUD. These \ncriteria are different for every\
      \ state. It would be helpful for SUD treatment providers to obtain copies of\
      \ \nthe criteria for their own states, as well as copies of the specific procedures\
      \ by which eligibility is \nestablished by their states’ mental health systems.\
      \ By determining that a client might be eligible for \nconsideration as a mental\
      \ health priority client, the SUD treatment counselor can assist the client\
      \ in \naccessing various services and benefits the client may not know are open\
      \ to her or him. \nTo gauge SMI status, start by asking whether the client already\
      \ gets mental health priority services \n(e.g., “Do you have a mental health\
      \ case manager?” “Are you a Department of Mental Health client?”). \n• \nIf\
      \ the client already is a mental health client, then he or she will be assigned\
      \ to quadrant II or IV. \nContact the mental health case manager and establish\
      \ collaboration to promote case management. \n• \nIf the client is not already\
      \ a mental health client but appears to be eligible, and the client and family\
      \ \nare willing, arrange a referral for eligibility determination. \n• \nClients\
      \ who present in SUD treatment settings who look as if they might have SMI,\
      \ but have not \nbeen so determined, should be considered to belong to quadrant\
      \ IV. \nFor assistance in determining the severity of symptoms and disability,\
      \ the SUD treatment provider can \nuse the severity criteria listed in DSM-5.\
      \ For disorders in which DSM-5 does not offer any guidance on \ndetermining\
      \ severity, counselors can use Dimension 3 (Co-Morbidity) subscales in the LOCUS\
      \ (see the \nsection “Assessment Step 5: Determine Level of Care”), particularly\
      \ the levels of severity of comorbidity \nand impairment/functionality. \nDetermination\
      \ of Severity of SUDs \nPresence of active or unstable substance misuse or serious\
      \ substance misuse as indicated by a DSM-5 \nseverity rating of “severe” would\
      \ identify the individual as being in quadrant III or IV. Less serious SUD (a\
      \ \nDSM-5 severity rating of “mild” or “moderate”) identifies the individual\
      \ as being in quadrant I or II."

      \ to have SMI with a serious SUD, he or she falls in quadrant IV; those with\
      \ SMI \nand a mild SUD fall in quadrant II. A client with a serious SUD who\
      \ has mental disorder symptoms that \ndo not constitute SMI falls into quadrant\
      \ III. A client with mild to moderate mental disorder symptoms \nand a less\
      \ serious SUD falls into quadrant I. \nClients in quadrant III who present in\
      \ SUD treatment settings are often best managed by receiving care \nin the SUD\
      \ treatment setting, with collaborative or consultative support from mental\
      \ health providers. \nIndividuals in quadrant IV usually require intensive intervention\
      \ to stabilize and determine eligibility for \nmental health services and appropriate\
      \ locus of continuing care. If they do not meet SMI criteria, once \ntheir more\
      \ serious mental symptoms have stabilized and substance use is controlled initially,\
      \ they begin \nto look like individuals in quadrant III, and can respond to\
      \ similar services. \nNote, however, that this discussion of quadrant determination\
      \ is not validated by clinical research. It is \nmerely a practical approach\
      \ to adapting an existing framework for clinical use, in advance of more \n\
      formal processes being developed, tested, and disseminated. \nIn many systems,\
      \ the process of assessment stops largely after assessment Step 4 with the \n\
      determination of placement. Some information from subsequent steps (especially\
      \ Step 7) may be \nincluded in this initial process, but usually more indepth\
      \ or detailed consideration of treatment needs \nmay not occur until after “placement”\
      \ in an actual treatment setting. \nAssessment Step 5: Determine Level of Care\
      \ \nClient placement in the appropriate care setting for his or her needs is\
      \ necessary to optimize treatment \ncompletion and desirable outcomes. Level\
      \ of care placement is also often required by private and public \npayers (i.e.,\
      \ Medicaid) for authorization of mental health services or SUD treatment decisions.\
      \ Thus, the \navailability of valid and reliable commonly used tools can not\
      \ only help increase the odds of effective \ntreatment matching but can help\
      \ providers meet documentation requirements for reimbursement. \nAssessment\
      \ Step 5—Application to Case Examples (Jane B.) \nJane B. is a 28-year-old single\
      \ White woman diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, AUD, and cocaine use \n\
      disorder. She has a history of multiple episodes of sexual victimization. She\
      \ is experiencing homelessness (living \nin a shelter), is actively psychotic,\
      \ and will not admit to substance misuse. She often visits the local ED for\
      \ \nmental and medical complaints but refuses follow-up treatment. Her main\
      \ requests are for money and food, not \ntreatment. Jane has been offered involvement\
      \ in a housing program that requires no treatment engagement or \nsobriety but\
      \ has refused because of paranoia about working with staff in this setting.\
      \ Jane B. declines \nmedication, given her paranoia, but does not seem acutely\
      \ dangerous to herself or others. \nThe severity of Jane B.’s condition and\
      \ her psychosis, homelessness, and lack of stability may lead the provider \n\
      initially to consider psychiatric hospitalization or referral for residential\
      \ SUD treatment. In fact, application of \nassessment criteria in the LOCUS\
      \ might have led easily to that conclusion. In the LOCUS, more flexible matching\
      \ \nis possible. The first consideration is whether the client meets criteria\
      \ for involuntary psychiatric commitment \n(usually, suicidal or homicidal impulses,\
      \ or inability to feed oneself or obtain shelter). In this instance, she is\
      \ \npsychotic and experiencing homelessness but has been able to find food and\
      \ shelter; she is unwilling to accept \nvoluntary mental health services. Further,\
      \ residential SUD treatment is inappropriate, both because she is \ncompletely\
      \ unmotivated to get help and because she is likely to be too psychotic to participate\
      \ in treatment \neffectively. The LOCUS would therefore recommend Level 3 –\
      \ “High Intensity Community Based Services.”  \nIf after extended participation\
      \ in the engagement strategies described earlier, she began to take antipsychotic\
      \ \nmedication, after a period of time her psychosis might clear up, and she\
      \ might begin to express interest in \ngetting sober. In that case, if she had\
      \ determined that she is unable to get sober on the street, residential SUD\
      \ \ntreatment would be indicated. Because of the longstanding severity of her\
      \ mental illness, it is likely that she"

      \ have some level of symptoms of her mental disorder and disability even when\
      \ medicated. In \nthis case, Jane B. probably would require a residential program\
      \ able to supply an enhanced level of services. \nTools for Determining Level\
      \ of Care \nLOCUS \nThe LOCUS Adult Version 20 (Sowers, 2016) can be used as\
      \ a systemwide level of care assessment \ninstrument for either mental health\
      \ settings only or for both mental health and SUD treatment settings. \nThe\
      \ LOCUS uses multiple dimensions of assessment, including: \n• \nRisk of harm.\
      \ \n• \nFunctional status. \n• \nComorbidity (medical, addictive, psychiatric).\
      \ \n• \nRecovery environment. \n• \nTreatment and recovery history. \n• \nEngagement\
      \ and recovery status. \nThe LOCUS (Plakun, 2018) helps: \n• \nDetermine a client’s\
      \ level of service needs. \n• \nDescribe all levels of care, from short-term\
      \ outpatient services to inpatient residential care. \n• \nProvide a quantified\
      \ approach to defining level of care based on scores on its six dimensions.\
      \  \nLOCUS has a point system for each dimension that permits aggregate scoring\
      \ to suggest level of service \nintensity. It permits level of care assessment\
      \ for clients with mental disorders or SUDs only, as well as \nthose with CODs.\
      \ It is highly correlated with the DSM-IV-TR Global Assessment of Functioning\
      \ scale and \nhas demonstrated good sensitivity in assessing severity of symptoms,\
      \ particularly those that are \npsychiatric in nature (Thurber, Wilson, Realmuto,\
      \ & Specker, 2018).  \nAssessment Step 6: Determine Diagnosis \nDetermining\
      \ the diagnosis can be a formidable clinical challenge in the assessment of\
      \ CODs. Clinicians in \nboth mental health services and SUD treatment settings\
      \ recognize that it can be impossible to establish \na firm diagnosis when confronted\
      \ with the mixed presentation of mental symptoms and ongoing \nsubstance misuse.\
      \ Of course, substance misuse contributes to the emergence or severity of mental\
      \ \nsymptoms and therefore confounds the diagnostic picture. Therefore, this\
      \ step often includes dealing \nwith confusing diagnostic presentations. Three\
      \ guiding principles can help counselors thoroughly assess \nthe client’s current\
      \ and past history of mental and substance-related symptoms and problems: \n\
      1. Conduct a thorough interview to establish past mental and SUD diagnoses and\
      \ treatments. \n2. Document all past diagnoses, including their relationship\
      \ to certain time periods (e.g., just before \nthe diagnosis, just after the\
      \ diagnosis, during symptomatic phases) and events, symptoms, and \nlevels of\
      \ functioning during those time periods. \n3. Determine the timing of mental\
      \ disorder symptoms, particularly in relationship to periods of \nsubstance\
      \ use and SUDs (e.g., during periods of abstinence, within 30 days of onset\
      \ of an SUD). \nAddiction counselors who want to improve their competencies\
      \ to address CODs are urged to become \nconversant with the basic resource used\
      \ to diagnose mental disorders, DSM­5 (APA, 2013). Indepth \ndiscussion of what\
      \ counselors need to know concerning DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, differential\
      \ diagnosis, \nand management of mental disorders in the context of co-occurring\
      \ addiction is in Chapter 4."

      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 62 \nPrinciples of Determining\
      \ Diagnosis  \n1. The Importance of Client History \nDiagnosis is established\
      \ more by history than by current symptom presentation. This applies to both\
      \ \nmental disorders and SUDs. The first step in determining the diagnosis is\
      \ to determine whether the \nclient has an established diagnosis or is receiving\
      \ ongoing treatment for an established disorder. This \ninformation can be obtained\
      \ by the counselor as part of the routine intake process. If there is evidence\
      \ \nof a disorder but the diagnosis or treatment recommendations are unclear,\
      \ the counselor immediately \nshould begin the process of obtaining this information\
      \ from collaterals. If there is a valid history of a \nmental disorder diagnosis\
      \ at admission to SUD treatment, that diagnosis should be considered \npresumptively\
      \ valid for initial treatment planning, and any existing stabilizing treatment\
      \ should be \nmaintained. In addition to confirming an established diagnosis,\
      \ the client’s history can provide insight \ninto patterns that may emerge and\
      \ add depth to knowledge of the client. \nFor example, if a client comes into\
      \ the clinician’s office and says she hears voices (whether or not the \nclient\
      \ is sober currently), no diagnosis should be made on that basis alone. There\
      \ are many reasons \npeople hear voices. They may be related to substance-related\
      \ syndromes (e.g., substance-induced \npsychosis or hallucinosis, which is the\
      \ experience of hearing voices that the client knows are not real, \nand that\
      \ may say things that are distressing or attacking—particularly when there is\
      \ a trauma history—\nbut are not bizarre). With CODs, most causes will be independent\
      \ of substance use (e.g., schizophrenia, \nschizoaffective disorder, affective\
      \ disorder with psychosis or dissociative hallucinosis related to PTSD). \n\
      Psychosis usually involves loss of ability to tell that the voices are not real\
      \ and increased likelihood that \nthey are bizarre in content. Methamphetamine\
      \ psychosis is particularly confounding because it can \nmimic schizophrenia.\
      \ Many clients with psychotic disorders will still hear voices when on medication,\
      \ \nbut the medication makes the voices less bizarre and helps clients know\
      \ they are not real. \nIf clients state, for example, that they have heard voices,\
      \ although not as much as they used to; have \nbeen abstinent for 4 years; have\
      \ remembered to take medication most days, but may forget; and have \nhad multiple\
      \ hospitalizations for psychosis 10 years ago but none since, then they clearly\
      \ have a \ndiagnosis of psychotic illness (probably schizophrenia or schizoaffective\
      \ disorder). Given their continuing \nsymptoms while abstinent and on medication,\
      \ it is quite possible that the diagnosis will persist. \nChapter 4 offers additional\
      \ information about differential diagnosis. \n2. Documenting Prior Diagnoses\
      \ \nIt is important to document prior diagnoses and gather information related\
      \ to current diagnoses, even \nthough SUD treatment counselors may not be licensed\
      \ to make a mental disorder diagnosis. \nDiagnoses established by history should\
      \ not be changed at the point of initial assessment. If the clinician \nhas\
      \ a suspicion that a long-established diagnosis may be invalid, it is important\
      \ that he or she takes time \nto gather additional information, consult with\
      \ collaterals, get more careful and detailed history, and \ndevelop a better\
      \ relationship with the client before recommending diagnostic reevaluation.\
      \ The \ncounselor should raise concerns related to diagnosis with the clinical\
      \ supervisor or at a team meeting. \nIn many instances, no well-established\
      \ mental disorder diagnosis exists, or multiple diagnoses confuse \nthe picture.\
      \ Even with an established diagnosis, it is helpful to gather information to\
      \ confirm that \ndiagnosis. During initial assessment, SUD treatment counselors\
      \ can gather data that can assist diagnosis, \neither by supporting the findings\
      \ of the existing mental health assessment or by providing useful \nbackground\
      \ information in the event a new mental health assessment is conducted. The\
      \ key is not"

      \ of past and present symptoms but to connect those symptoms to periods in the\
      \ \nclient’s life that are helpful in the diagnostic process—namely, before\
      \ the onset of an SUD and during \nperiods of abstinence (or very limited use)\
      \ or after SUD onset and persisting for more than 30 days. \nThe clinician should\
      \ determine whether mental symptoms occur only when the client is using \nsubstances\
      \ actively. Therefore, it is important to determine the nature and severity\
      \ of the symptoms of \nthe mental disorder when the SUD is stabilized. Note\
      \ whether the client had a recent complete physical, \nincluding appropriate\
      \ labs. Physical diseases can also present with or mimic mental disorders (e.g.,\
      \ \nhypothyroidism presenting with or like depression) and need to be identified\
      \ and treated accordingly. \n3. Linking Mental Symptoms to Specific Periods\
      \ \nFor diagnostic purposes, it is almost always necessary to tie mental symptoms\
      \ to specific periods of \ntime in the client’s history, in particular those\
      \ times when an active SUD was not present. \nMost SUD assessment tools do not\
      \ require connection of mental symptoms to substance use or \nabstinence. Mental\
      \ disorder symptom information obtained from such tools can confuse counselors\
      \ and \nmake them feel that the whole process is not worth the effort. In fact,\
      \ it is striking that when clinicians \nseek information about mental symptoms\
      \ during periods of abstinence, such information is almost \nnever part of traditional\
      \ assessment forms. The mental history and substance use history have in the\
      \ \npast been collected separately and independently. As a result, the opportunity\
      \ to evaluate interaction, \nwhich is the most important diagnostic information\
      \ beyond the history, has been routinely lost. Newer \nand more detailed assessment\
      \ tools overcome these historical, unnecessary divisions. \nThe M.I.N.I. Plus\
      \ (a more detailed version of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview\
      \ [Sheehan \net al., 1998]) is structured to connect any identified symptoms\
      \ to periods of abstinence. Clinicians can \nuse this information to distinguish\
      \ substance-induced mental disorders from independent mental \ndisorders. The\
      \ Timeline Follow-Back Method also is a valid and practical tool that can be\
      \ used with \nindividuals with substance misuse or CODs (Hjorthoj, Hjorthoj,\
      \ & Nordentoft, 2012) to gather a detailed \nand comprehensive assessment of\
      \ patterns of substance misuse beyond just quantity and frequency.  \nConsequently,\
      \ the SUD treatment counselor can proceed in two ways: \n• \nAsk whether mental\
      \ symptoms or treatments identified in screening were present during periods\
      \ of \n30 days of abstinence or longer, or were present before onset of substance\
      \ use. (“Did this symptom \nor episode occur during a period when you were abstinent\
      \ for at least 30 days?”) \n• \nDefine with the client specific time periods\
      \ when the SUD was in remission, and then get detailed \ninformation about mental\
      \ symptoms, diagnoses, impairments, and treatments during those periods \nof\
      \ time. (“Can you recall a time when you were not using? Did these symptoms\
      \ [or whatever the \nclient has reported] occur during that period?”) This approach\
      \ may yield more reliable information. \nDuring this latter process, the counselor\
      \ can use one of the medium-power symptom screening tools as \na guide. Alternatively,\
      \ the counselor can use the handy outlines of the DSM-5 criteria for common\
      \ \ndisorders (provided in Chapter 4) and inquire whether those criteria symptoms\
      \ were met, whether they \nwere diagnosed and treated, and if so, with what\
      \ methods and how successfully. This information can \nsuggest or support the\
      \ accuracy of diagnoses. Documentation also can facilitate later diagnostic\
      \ \nassessment by a mental-health–trained clinician. \nAssessment Step 7: Determine\
      \ Disability and Functional Impairment \nDetermination of both current and baseline\
      \ functional impairment contributes to identification of the \nneed for case\
      \ management or higher levels of support. This step also relates to the determination\
      \ of"

      \ Assessment of current cognitive capacity, social skills, and other functional\
      \ \nabilities also is necessary to determine if there are deficits that may\
      \ require modification in the \ntreatment protocols of relapse prevention efforts\
      \ or recovery programs. For example, the counselor \nmight inquire about past\
      \ participation in special education or related testing. \nAssessing Functional\
      \ Capability \nCurrent level of impairment is determined by assessing functional\
      \ capabilities and deficits in each of the \nareas indicated in the following\
      \ list. Similarly, baseline level of impairment is determined by identifying\
      \ \nperiods of extended abstinence and mental health stability (greater than\
      \ 30 days) according to the \nmethods described in the previous assessment step.\
      \ The clinician determines: \n• \nIs the client capable of living independently\
      \ (in terms of independent living skills, not in terms of \nmaintaining abstinence)?\
      \ If not, what types of support are needed? \n• \nIs the client capable of supporting\
      \ himself or herself financially? If so, through what means? If not, \nis the\
      \ client disabled, or dependent on others for financial support? \n• \nCan the\
      \ client engage in reasonable social relationships? Are there good social supports?\
      \ If not, \nwhat interferes with this ability, and what supports would the client\
      \ need? \n• \nWhat is the client’s level of cognitive functioning? Is there\
      \ a developmental or learning disability? \nAre there cognitive or memory impairments\
      \ that impede learning? Is the client limited in ability to \nread, write, or\
      \ understand? Is there difficulty focusing, concentrating, and completing tasks?\
      \ \nFunctional Assessment Tools \nSeveral freely available, reliable, well-validated\
      \ tools measure functioning and impairment in clients with \nmental illness,\
      \ substance misuse, or both (Gold, 2014; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,\
      \ and \nMedicine, 2016; Sanchez-Moreno, Martinez-Aran, & Vieta, 2017), including:\
      \ \n• \nWHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 ([WHODAS 2.0] Üstün & WHO, 2010;\
      \ \nwww.who.int/classifications/icf/whodasii/en/). When DSM-5 removed the Global\
      \ Assessment of \nFunctioning (Axis V in DSM-IV), APA proposed in its place\
      \ the WHODAS 2.0 as a tool to rate global \nimpairment and functional capabilities\
      \ (APA, 2013). The WHODAS 2.0 assesses six major domains, \nwhich are: \n− Understanding\
      \ and communicating.7 \n− Getting around (mobility). \n− Self-care. \n− Getting\
      \ along with people (social and interpersonal functioning). \n− Life activities\
      \ (home, academic, and occupational functioning). \n− Participation in society\
      \ (participation in family, social, and community activities). \n• \nASI (McLellan\
      \ et al., 1992), a mental health screening tool that provides information about\
      \ level of \nfunctioning for clients with SUDs. This is valuable when supplemented\
      \ by interview information. \n(Note that the ASI also exists in an expanded\
      \ version specifically for women, ASI-F [SAMHSA, \n2009c].)  \nIn a clinical\
      \ interview, the counselor also should inquire about any current or past difficulties\
      \ the client \nhas had in learning or using relapse prevention skills, participating\
      \ in mutual support recovery programs, \nor obtaining medication or following\
      \ medication regimens. In the same vein, the clinician may inquire \nabout use\

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 65 \nFor individuals with\
      \ CODs, impairment may be related to intellectual/cognitive ability or the mental\
      \ \ndisorder, which may exist in addition to the SUD. The clinician should establish\
      \ level of intellectual/ \ncognitive functioning in childhood, whether impairment\
      \ persists, and if so, at what level, during the \nperiods when substance use\
      \ is in full or partial remission, just as in the previous discussion of diagnosis.\
      \ \nDetermining the Need for Capable or Enhanced-Level Services \nA specific\
      \ tool to assess the need for capable- or enhanced-level services for people\
      \ with CODs currently \nis not available. The consensus panel recommends a process\
      \ of “practical assessment” that seeks to \nmatch the client’s assessment (mental\
      \ health, substance misuse, level of impairment) to the type of \nservices needed.\
      \ The individual may even be given trial tasks or assignments to determine in\
      \ concert \nwith the counselor if her performance meets the requirements of\
      \ the program being considered. \nASAM criteria for COD-capable and -eligible\
      \ programs are as follows (Mee-Lee, Shulman, Fishman, \nGastfriend, & Miller\
      \ 2013): \n• \nCo-occurring–capable (COC) programs in addiction treatment focus\
      \ primarily on SUDs but can treat \npatients with subthreshold or diagnosable\
      \ but stable mental disorders (Mee-Lee et al., 2013). \nMental health services\
      \ may be onsite or available by referral. COC programs in mental health are\
      \ \nthose that mainly focus on mental disorders but can treat patients with\
      \ subthreshold or diagnosable \nbut stable SUDs (Mee-Lee et al., 2013). Addiction\
      \ counselors are onsite or available through referral. \n• \nCo-occurring–enhanced\
      \ (COE) programs have more integrated addiction and mental health services \n\
      and have staff who are trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of both disorders\
      \ and are \ncompetent in providing integrated treatment for both mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs at the same time.  \n• \nComplexity-capable programs are designed\
      \ to meet the needs of individuals (and their families) \nwith multiple complex\
      \ conditions that extend beyond just CODs. Physical and psychosocial \nconditions\
      \ and treatment areas of focus often include chronic medical illnesses like\
      \ HIV, trauma, \nlegal matters, housing difficulties, criminal justice system\
      \ involvement, unemployment, education \nconcerns, childcare or parenting difficulties,\
      \ and cognitive dysfunctions. \nAssessment Step 8: Identify Strengths and Supports\
      \ \nAll assessment must include some specific attention to the individual’s\
      \ current strengths, skills, and \nsupports, both in relation to general life\
      \ functioning, and in relation to his or her ability to manage either \nmental\
      \ disorders or SUDs. This often provides a more positive approach to treatment\
      \ engagement than \ndoes focusing exclusively on deficits that need to be corrected.\
      \ This is no less true for individuals with \nserious mental disorders than\
      \ it is for people with SUDs only. Questions might focus on: \n• \nTalents and\
      \ interests. \n• \nAreas of educational interest and literacy; vocational skill,\
      \ interest, and ability, such as social skills or \ncapacity for creative self-expression.\
      \ \n• \nAreas connected with high levels of motivation to change, for either\
      \ disorder or both. \n• \nExisting supportive relationships—treatment, peer,\
      \ or family—particularly ongoing mental disorder \ntreatment relationships.\
      \ \n• \nPrevious mental health services and SUD treatment successes and exploration\
      \ of what worked. \n• \nIdentification of current successes: What has the client\
      \ done right recently for either disorder? \n• \nBuilding treatment plans and\
      \ interventions based on utilizing and reinforcing strengths and \nextending\
      \ or supporting what has worked previously."

      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 66 \nAssessment Step 8—Application\
      \ to Case Examples (Jane B.) \nJane B. expressed significant interest in work\
      \ once her paranoia subsided. She was attempting to address her \nSUD on an\
      \ outpatient basis, as a residential treatment program was unavailable. Her\
      \ case management team \nnoted her interest and experience in caring for animals.\
      \ Via individualized placement and support, they helped \nher obtain a part-time\
      \ job at a local pet shop two afternoons per week. She was proud of her job\
      \ and reported \nthat it helped maintain her motivation to stay away from substances\
      \ and to keep taking medication. \nFor individuals with SMI or substance misuse,\
      \ the Individualized Placement and Support model of \npsychiatric rehabilitation\
      \ has demonstrated that it is a cost-effective way to generate positive vocational\
      \ \nand mental health outcomes compared with other models of vocational rehabilitation\
      \ for this \npopulation, including improved rates of obtaining competitive employment,\
      \ greater number of hours \nworked, increased wages, improvements in self-esteem\
      \ and quality of life, and reductions in mental \nhealth service use (Drake,\
      \ Bond, Goldman, Hogan, & Karakus, 2016; LePage et al., 2016). In this model,\
      \ \nclients with disabilities who want to work may be placed in sheltered work\
      \ activities based on strengths \nand preferences, even when actively using\
      \ substances and inconsistently complying with medication \nregimens. In nonsheltered\
      \ work activities, it is critical to remember that many employers have \nsubstance-free\
      \ workplace policies. Participating in ongoing jobs is valuable to self-esteem\
      \ in itself and \ncan generate the motivation to address mental disorders and\
      \ substance problems, as they appear to \ninterfere specifically with work success.\
      \ Taking advantage of educational and volunteer opportunities \nalso may enhance\
      \ self-esteem and is often a first step in securing employment.  \nAssessment\
      \ Step 9: Identify Cultural and Linguistic Needs and Supports \nDetailed cultural\
      \ assessment is beyond the scope of this publication. Cultural assessment of\
      \ individuals \nwith CODs is not substantially different from cultural assessment\
      \ for those with SUDs or mental \ndisorders only, but some specific areas are\
      \ worth addressing, such as: \n• \nProblems with literacy. \n• \nNot fitting\
      \ into the treatment culture (SUD or mental health culture); conflict in treatment.\
      \ \n• \nCultural and linguistic service barriers. \nNot Fitting Into the Treatment\
      \ Culture \nTo a certain degree, individuals with addiction and SMI may have\
      \ difficulty fitting into existing treatment \ncultures. Many clients are aware\
      \ of a variety of different attitudes and suggestions toward their \ndisorders\
      \ that can affect relationships with others. Traditional culture carriers (parents,\
      \ grandparents) \nmay have different views of their problems and the most appropriate\
      \ treatment compared with peers. \nIndividual clients may have positive or negative\
      \ allegiance to a variety of peer or treatment cultures \n(e.g., mental health\
      \ consumer movement, having mild or moderate severity mental disorders vs. SMI,\
      \ \n12-Step or dual recovery mutual support) based on past experience or on\
      \ fears and concerns related to \nthe mental disorder. Specific questions to\
      \ explore with the client include: \n• \n“How are your substance use and mental\
      \ health concerns defined by your parents? Peers? Other clients?” \n• \n“What\
      \ do they think you should be doing to remedy these problems?” \n• \n“How do\
      \ you decide which suggestions to follow?” \n• \n“In what kinds of treatment\
      \ settings do you feel most comfortable?” \n• \n“What do you think I (the counselor)\
      \ should be doing to help you improve your situation?”"

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 3—Screening\
      \ and Assessment of Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 67 \nAssessment Step 9—Application\
      \ to Case Example (George T.) \nThe client is a 34-year-old married, employed\
      \ African American man with cocaine use disorder, alcohol misuse, \nand bipolar\
      \ disorder (stabilized on lithium) mandated to cocaine treatment by his employer\
      \ after a failed drug \ntest. George T. and his family realize he needs help\
      \ not to use cocaine but disagree that alcohol is a significant \nproblem (nor\
      \ does his employer). He complains that his mood swings intensify when he is\
      \ using cocaine. \nGeorge T.’s counselor originally referred him to Cocaine\
      \ Anonymous (CA). When George T. went, however, he \nreported back to the counselor\
      \ that he did not feel comfortable there. He felt that as a family man with\
      \ a \nresponsible job, he had pulled himself out of the “street culture” that\
      \ this specific meeting reflected. He also \nnoted that most participants were\
      \ White. Unlike many people with CODs who feel more ashamed of mental \ndisorders\
      \ than addiction, he felt more ashamed at the CA meeting than at his support\
      \ group for people with \nmental disorders. Therefore, for George T., it was\
      \ culturally appropriate to address the shame surrounding his \nsubstance use,\
      \ encourage him to try other mutual support program meetings, and continue to\
      \ provide positive \nfeedback about his attendance at the support group for\
      \ his mental disorder. \nCultural and Linguistic Service Barriers \nCultural\
      \ and linguistic barriers can compound access to COD treatment. The assessment\
      \ process must \naddress whether these barriers prevent access to care (e.g.,\
      \ the client reads or speaks only Spanish; the \nclient is illiterate) and if\
      \ so, determine options for providing more individualized intervention or for\
      \ \nintegrating intervention into naturalistic culturally and linguistically\
      \ appropriate human service settings. \nChapter 5 describes components of culturally\
      \ responsive services. Chapter 6 offers information about \npeople of diverse\
      \ racial/ethnic backgrounds with CODs needs and how counselors can help reduce\
      \ \ntreatment access and outcome disparities experienced by marginalized racial/ethnic\
      \ groups. \nAssessment Step 10: Identify Problem Domains \nIndividuals with\
      \ CODs may have difficulties in multiple life domains (e.g., medical, legal,\
      \ vocational, \nfamily, social). The ASI can identify and quantify substance\
      \ use–related problems across domains, to see \nwhich require attention. It\
      \ is used most effectively as a component of a comprehensive assessment. \n\
      A comprehensive, biopsychosocial evaluation for individuals with CODs requires\
      \ clarifying how each \ndisorder interacts with the problems in each domain,\
      \ as well as identifying contingencies that might \npromote treatment adherence\
      \ for mental health, SUD treatment, or both. Information about others \nwho\
      \ might assist in the implementation of such contingencies (e.g., probation\
      \ officers, family, friends) \nneeds to be gathered, including appropriate releases\
      \ of information. \nAssessment Step 11: Determine Stage of Change \nA key evidence-based\
      \ best practice for treatment matching clients with CODs is to match interventions\
      \ \nnot only to specific diagnoses but also to stage of change and stage of\
      \ treatment for each disorder.   \nIn SUD treatment settings, stage of change\
      \ assessment usually involves determination of Prochaska and \nDiClemente Stages\
      \ of Change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation (or determination),\
      \ action, \nmaintenance, and relapse (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1992). This can\
      \ involve using questionnaires such \nas the University of Rhode Island Change\
      \ Assessment Scale (McConnaughy, Prochaska, & Velicer, 1983; \navailable at\
      \ https://habitslab.umbc.edu/urica/) or the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment\
      \ \nEagerness Scale (Miller & Tonigan, 1996; available at https://casaa.unm.edu/inst/SOCRATESv8.pdf).\
      \ \nStage of change can be determined clinically by interviewing clients and\
      \ evaluating their responses in \nthe context of change. For example, one approach\
      \ to stage of change identification is to ask clients, for \neach problem, to\
      \ select the statement that most closely fits their view of that problem:"

      \ ready to change (Preparation). \n• \nActively working on changing, even if\
      \ slowly (Action). \n• \nHas achieved stability, and is trying to maintain (Maintenance).\
      \ \nStage of change assessment ideally will be applied separately to each mental\
      \ disorder and to each SUD. \nFor example, a client may be willing to take medication\
      \ for a depressive disorder but unwilling to discuss \ntrauma, or motivated\
      \ to stop cocaine but unwilling to consider alcohol as a problem. \nFor more\
      \ indepth discussion of the stages of change and motivational enhancement, see\
      \ TIP 35, \nEnhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder Treatment\
      \ (SAMHSA, 2019d). \nAssessment Step 12: Plan Treatment \nA comprehensive assessment\
      \ is the basis for an individualized treatment plan. Appropriate treatment \n\
      plans and treatment interventions can be quite complex, depending on what might\
      \ be discovered in \neach domain. There is no single, correct intervention or\
      \ program for individuals with CODs. Rather, \nmatch appropriate treatment to\
      \ individual needs per these multiple considerations. \nThe following case (Maria\
      \ M.) illustrates how the noted factors help generate an integrated treatment\
      \ \nplan that is appropriate to the needs and situation of a particular client.\
      \ \nAssessment Step 12—Application to Case Example (Maria M.) \nThe client is\
      \ a 38-year-old Latina woman who is the mother of two teenagers. Maria M. presents\
      \ with an 11-\nyear history of cocaine dependence, a 2-year history of opioid\
      \ dependence, and a history of trauma related to a \nlongstanding abusive relationship\
      \ (now over for 6 years). She is not in an intimate relationship at present\
      \ and \nthere is no current indication that she is at risk for either violence\
      \ or self-harm. She also has persistent major \ndepression and panic treated\
      \ with antidepressants. She is very motivated to receive treatment. \nIdeal\
      \ Integrated Treatment Plan: The plan for Maria M. might include medication-assisted\
      \ treatment (e.g., \nmethadone or buprenorphine), continued antidepressant medication,\
      \ a mutual support program, and other \nrecovery group support for cocaine dependence.\
      \ She also could be referred to a group for both SUD and trauma \nthat is designed\
      \ specifically to help reduce symptoms of trauma and resolve long-term problems.\
      \ \nIndividual, group, and family interventions could be coordinated by the\
      \ primary counselor from opioid \nmaintenance treatment. The focus of these\
      \ interventions might be on relapse prevention skills, taking \nmedication as\
      \ prescribed, and identifying and managing trauma-related symptoms without using.\
      \  \nConsiderations in Treatment Matching \nA major goal of the screening and\
      \ assessment process is to ensure the client is matched with \nappropriate treatment.\
      \ Acknowledging the overriding importance of this goal, this discussion of the\
      \ \nprocess of clinical assessment for individuals with CODs begins with a fundamental\
      \ statement of \nprinciple: Because clients with CODs are not all the same,\
      \ program placements and treatment \ninterventions should be matched individually\
      \ to the needs of each client. \nThe ultimate purpose of the assessment process\
      \ is to develop an appropriately individualized integrated \ntreatment plan.\
      \ In this model, the consensus panel recommends the following approach: \n•\
      \ \nTreatment planning for individuals with CODs and associated problems should\
      \ follow the principle \nof mental disorder dual (or multiple) primary treatment,\
      \ in which a specific intervention is matched"

      \ hope, and empathy for long-term recovery; and \nhelp set the stage for effective\
      \ treatment. Most of these activities are already a routine component of \n\
      substance misuse-only assessment; the key additional element is attention to\
      \ treatment requirements \nand stage of change for mental disorders, and the\
      \ possible interference of mental disorder symptoms \nand disabilities (including\
      \ personality disorder symptoms) in SUD treatment participation."

      \ Substance-Related Disorders: Diagnostic and Cross-Cutting Topics    \n \n\
      Page 72 \nChapter 4—Mental and Substance-Related \nDisorders: Diagnostic and\
      \ Cross-Cutting Topics  \n (For Counselors, Other Treatment/Service Providers,\
      \ \nSupervisors, and Administrators) \nDisentangling symptoms of SUDs from those\
      \ of co-occurring mental disorders is a complex but \nnecessary step in correctly\
      \ assessing, diagnosing, determining level of service, selecting appropriate\
      \ and \neffective treatments, and planning follow-up care. This chapter is designed\
      \ to facilitate those processes \nby ensuring addiction counselors and other\
      \ providers have a clear understanding of mental disorder \nsymptoms and diagnostic\
      \ criteria, their relationships with SUDs, and pertinent management strategies.\
      \ \nThis chapter provides an overview for working with SUD treatment clients\
      \ who also have mental \ndisorders. It is presented in concise form so that\
      \ the counselor can refer to this one chapter to obtain \nbasic information.\
      \ The material included is not a complete review of all mental disorders and\
      \ is not \nintended to be a primer on diagnosis. Rather, it offers a summary\
      \ of mental disorders with special \nrelevance to co-occurring SUDs (see the\
      \ section “Scope of the Chapter”).  \nSince the original publication of this\
      \ Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP), updated mental disorder \ncriteria have\
      \ been published in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth\
      \ Edition \n(DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). This chapter\
      \ contains these latest criteria and, \nwhere available, data from prevalence\
      \ studies and randomized controlled trials in reflection of DSM-5. \nOrganization\
      \ of the Chapter \nThe chapter begins with a brief description of selected mental\
      \ disorders and their DSM-5 diagnostic \ncriteria. For each disorder, material\
      \ highlights some of the descriptive and diagnostic features, \nprevalence statistics,\
      \ and relationship to SUDs. In general, the mental disorders in this chapter\
      \ are \npresented in the following descending order by how commonly they co-occur\
      \ with SUDs, although this is \nnot applied rigidly: Depressive disorders, bipolar\
      \ I disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \nKey Messages \nThe co-occurrence\
      \ of mental disorders with substance use disorders (SUDs) is the rule, not the\
      \ exception. \nAddiction counselors should expect and prepare to see clients\
      \ with these disorders in their settings. \nAddiction counselors generally do\
      \ not diagnose mental disorders. But to engage in accurate treatment planning\
      \ \nand to offer comprehensive, efficacious, and responsive services (or referral\
      \ for such), clinicians must be able to \nrecognize the disorders most likely\
      \ to be seen in populations who misuse substances. \nIt is not always readily\
      \ apparent whether a co-occurring mental disorder is directly caused by substance\
      \ misuse \nor is an independent disorder merely appearing alongside an SUD.\
      \ This differentiation can be difficult to make \nbut is critically important,\
      \ as it informs treatment decision making. \nSuicide and trauma are sadly common\
      \ across most combinations of co-occurring disorders (CODs) and require \nspecial\
      \ attention. Addiction counselors have an ethical and professional responsibility\
      \ to keep clients safe and to \nprovide services that are supportive, empathic,\
      \ person-centered, and that reduce suffering."

      \ psychosis, attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and feeding\
      \ and eating disorders.  \nBecause of the greater availability of case histories\
      \ from the mental health literature, the illustrative \nmaterial has more emphasis\
      \ on the mental disorders. Although not intended to offer extensive guidance\
      \ \non treatment, this chapter’s coverage of specific mental disorders does\
      \ include brief information about \ninterventions for and clinical approaches\
      \ to managing CODs involving each. (Chapter 7 focuses on \ntreatment models\
      \ for people with CODs.) Case histories illustrate the interaction between mental\
      \ \ndisorders and SUDs. Each diagnostic topic contains an Advice to the Counselor\
      \ box containing key \nconsiderations related to diagnosis, treatment, or both.\
      \ \nThe next main section of this chapter addresses substance-related disorders,\
      \ including SUDs and \nsubstance-induced mental disorders. (DSM-5 uses the term\
      \ “substance/medication-induced disorders;” \nthis TIP focuses on nonmedication\
      \ substances and thus will exclude the term “medication.”) Because the \nprimary\
      \ audience for this chapter is addiction counselors, it is assumed that readers\
      \ are already highly \nfamiliar with SUDs and their diagnostic criteria. Thus,\
      \ the SUD section is comparatively briefer than the \nmental disorders section.\
      \ The overall focus remains on substance-induced mental disorders, their \n\
      relationship to independent co-occurring mental disorders, and what counselors\
      \ need to know in terms \nof assessment and treatment. \nThe chapter ends with\
      \ an overview of two concerns that appear across nearly all COD populations:\
      \ \nsuicidality and trauma. Although suicidality is not a DSM-5-diagnosed mental\
      \ disorder per se, it is a high-\nrisk behavior requiring serious attention\
      \ by providers. The discussion of suicidality highlights key \ninformation addiction\
      \ counselors should know about risk of self-harm in combination with substance\
      \ \nmisuse, mental disorders, or both. The section offers factual information\
      \ (e.g., prevalence data), \ncommonly agreed-on clinical practices, and other\
      \ general information that may be best characterized as \n“working formulations.”\
      \ Like suicide, trauma itself is not a mental disorder but is extremely common\
      \ in \nmany psychiatric conditions, frequently coincides with addiction, and\
      \ increases the odds of negative \noutcomes, including suicide. Having at least\
      \ a basic understanding of suicide and trauma is a core \ncompetency for addiction\
      \ counselors working with clients who have CODs and will help improve their\
      \ \nability to not only offer effective services but keep clients safe. \nScope\
      \ of the Chapter \nThe mental disorder section of this chapter does not include\
      \ all DSM-5 mental disorders. The consensus \npanel acknowledges that people\
      \ with CODs may have multiple combinations of the various mental \ndisorders\
      \ presented in this chapter (e.g., a person could have an SUD, bipolar I disorder,\
      \ and borderline \nPD [BPD]). However, for purposes of clarity and brevity,\
      \ the panel chose to focus the discussion on the \nmain disorders primarily\
      \ seen in people with CODs and not explore the multitude of possible \ncombinations.\
      \ This does not mean that other mental disorders excluded from this chapter\
      \ cannot and \ndo not co-occur with substance misuse. But the scope of this\
      \ chapter is such that it focuses only on \nmental disorders most likely to\
      \ be seen by SUD treatment professionals.  \nLicit and illicit drugs of misuse\
      \ can cause symptoms that are identical to the symptoms of mental illness. Mental\
      \ \ndisorder diagnoses should be provisional and reevaluated constantly. Some\
      \ mental disorders are really \nsubstance­induced mental disorders, meaning\
      \ they are caused by substance use. Treatment of the SUD and an \nabstinent\
      \ period of weeks or months may be required for a definitive diagnosis of an\
      \ independent, co­occurring \nmental disorder. A fuller discussion of substance-induced\
      \ disorders is provided later in this chapter."

      Page 74 \nThe consensus panel recognizes that although this chapter covers a\
      \ broad range of mental disorders and \ndiagnostic material, it cannot and should\
      \ not replace the comprehensive training necessary for \ndiagnosing and treating\
      \ clients with specific mental disorders co­occurring with SUDs. It is assumed\
      \ that \nreaders of this TIP will already have working knowledge of mental disorders\
      \ and their symptoms. The \nAdvice to the Counselor boxes cannot fully address\
      \ the complexity involved in treating clients with \nCODs. These boxes distill\
      \ for counselors the main actions and approaches they can take in working with\
      \ \nclients in SUD treatment who have the specific mental disorder being discussed.\
      \ \nThe consensus panel recognizes that this chapter cannot cover each mental\
      \ disorder exhaustively and \nthat addiction counselors are not expected to\
      \ diagnose mental disorders. The panel’s limited goals for \nthis chapter are\
      \ to increase SUD treatment counselors’ familiarity with mental disorder terminology\
      \ and \ncriteria and to guide them on how to proceed with clients who have these\
      \ disorders. The chapter also is \nmeant to stimulate further work in this area\
      \ and to make this research accessible to the addiction field. \nWarning to\
      \ Counselors: Know Your Limits of Practice \nThis TIP is for addiction counselors\
      \ in direct clinical contact with clients who have SUDs. Legal titles, levels,\
      \ types \nof licenses, certifications, and scopes of practice for addiction\
      \ counselors differ across all states and the District \nof Columbia (University\
      \ of Michigan Behavioral Health Workforce Research Center, 2018). For instance,\
      \ in \ncertain states, addiction counselors can only conduct assessments and\
      \ offer treatments for SUDs, limiting their \nability to reach clients with\
      \ CODs. Certification requirements and authorized services also vary by state.\
      \ \nThis TIP is intended to benefit all licensed or certified addiction counselors,\
      \ regardless of their titles. However, \nthe diagnostic and counseling activities\
      \ described in this TIP are not necessarily appropriate for all addiction \n\
      counselors to undertake, especially given that addiction counselors do not normally\
      \ possess the required \ntraining and clinical experience to diagnose mental\
      \ disorders. Different SUD treatment settings will have \ndifferent policies\
      \ and rules about what addiction counselors can and cannot do. Whether certified/licensed\
      \ or \nnot, addiction counselors should use these methods only under the supervision\
      \ of an appropriately trained \nand certified or licensed SUD treatment provider\
      \ or other mental health clinician. Maintaining collaborative \nrelationships\
      \ with mental health service providers for consultation and referral is recommended,\
      \ either directly \nor through clinical supervision. \nDepressive Disorders\
      \  \nThe depressive disorders category in DSM-5 comprises numerous conditions;\
      \ addiction counselors are \nmost likely to encounter major depressive disorder\
      \ (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD; also \ncalled dysthymia) among\
      \ their clients. Common features of all depressive disorders are excessively\
      \ sad, \nempty, or irritable mood and somatic and cognitive changes that significantly\
      \ affect ability to function.  \nMDD \nMDD is not merely extreme sadness, although\
      \ sad mood is a defining characteristic. MDD is marked by \neither depressed\
      \ mood or loss of interest in nearly all previously enjoyed activities. At least\
      \ one of those \nsymptoms must be present and must persist most of the day,\
      \ almost every day over a 2-week period \n(Exhibit 4.1). Other core physical,\
      \ cognitive, and psychosocial features of MDD also must be present \nnearly\
      \ every day, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. \nMDD\
      \ is highly associated with suicide risk. A study reported 39 percent of people\
      \ with a lifetime MDD \ndiagnosis contemplated suicide; nearly 14 percent had\
      \ a lifetime history of suicide attempt (Hasin et al., \n2018). Yet suicide\
      \ is not isolated to those with depressed mood. Counselors always should ask\
      \ clients if \nthey have been thinking of suicide, whether or not they have,\
      \ or mention, symptoms of depression."

      \ following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent\
      \ a \nchange from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either\
      \ (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of \ninterest or pleasure.  \nNote: Do not\
      \ include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.\
      \  \n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either\
      \ subjective report (e.g., feels sad, \nempty, hopeless) or observation made\
      \ by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: In children and adolescents, \ncan\
      \ be irritable mood.  \n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all,\
      \ or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as \nindicated\
      \ by either subjective account or observation).  \n3. Significant weight loss\
      \ when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5 percent of\
      \ body \nweight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every\
      \ day. Note: In children, consider failure \nto make expected weight gain. \
      \ \n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.  \n5. Psychomotor agitation\
      \ or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective\
      \ feelings \nof restlessness or being slowed down).  \n6. Fatigue or loss of\
      \ energy nearly every day.  \n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate\
      \ guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day \n(not merely self-reproach\
      \ or guilt about being sick).  \n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate,\
      \ or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account \nor as\
      \ observed by others).  \n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying),\
      \ recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a \nsuicide attempt\
      \ or a specific plan for committing suicide.  \nB. The symptoms cause clinically\
      \ significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important\
      \ \nareas of functioning.  \nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological\
      \ effects of a substance or to another medical condition.  \nNote: Criteria\
      \ A–C represent a major depressive episode (MDE).  \nNote: Responses to a significant\
      \ loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a\
      \ serious \nmedical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense\
      \ sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, \npoor appetite, and weight\
      \ loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although\
      \ such \nsymptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss,\
      \ the presence of an MDE in addition to \nthe normal response to a significant\
      \ loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires\
      \ \nthe exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and\
      \ the cultural norms for the expression of \ndistress in the context of loss.1\
      \  \nD. The occurrence of the MDE is not better explained by schizoaffective\
      \ disorder, schizophrenia, \nschizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder,\
      \ or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and \nother psychotic\
      \ disorders. \nE. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.\
      \ \nNote: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like\
      \ episodes are substance-induced or \nare attributable to the physiological\
      \ effects of another medical condition.  \nSpecify: \n• With anxious distress\

      Page 76 \nSevere depressive episodes can include psychotic features, such as\
      \ an auditory hallucination of a voice \nsaying that the person is “horrible,”\
      \ a visual hallucination of a lost relative mocking the person, or a \ndelusion\
      \ that one’s internal body parts have rotted away. However, most people who\
      \ have an MDE do \nnot exhibit psychotic symptoms even when the depression is\
      \ severe (for more information on psychosis, \nsee the section “Schizophrenia\
      \ and Other Psychotic Disorders”). \nMDE must be distinguished from grief or\
      \ bereavement, which are not mental disorders but rather \nnormal human responses\
      \ to loss. However, it is possible to experience both grief and MDD; that is,\
      \ the \npresence of grief does not rule out the presence of MDD. DSM-5 provides\
      \ detailed guidance on \ndiagnosing MDD in people who are bereaved. \nPDD \n\
      PDD presents as excessively sad or depressed mood that lasts most of the day,\
      \ more days than not, for \nat least 2 years. PDD is somewhat of an “umbrella”\
      \ diagnosis in that it covers two different types of \npeople with depression:\
      \ people with chronic MDD (i.e., depression lasting at least 2 years) and people\
      \ \nwho do not meet criteria for an MDD (see Criteria A through C in Exhibit\
      \ 4.1) but otherwise have had \n• With atypical features \n• With mood-congruent\
      \ psychotic features \n• With mood-incongruent psychotic features \n• With catatonia\
      \ \n• With peripartum onset \n• With seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only)\
      \ \nSpecify current severity/course: \n• Mild \n• Moderate  \n• Severe \n• With\
      \ psychotic features \n• In partial remission \n• In full remission \n• Unspecified\
      \ \n1 In distinguishing grief from an MDE, it is useful to consider that in\
      \ grief the predominant affect is feelings of \nemptiness and loss, while in\
      \ MDE it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness\
      \ or \npleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over\
      \ days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-\ncalled pangs of grief. These waves\
      \ tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The \ndepressed\
      \ mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\
      \ The pain of \ngrief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that\
      \ are uncharacteristic of the pervasive \nunhappiness and misery characteristic\
      \ of MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally features a \n\
      preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical\
      \ or pessimistic \nruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is generally\
      \ preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness \nand self-loathing are\
      \ common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves\
      \ perceived \nfailings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently\
      \ enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she \nwas loved). If a bereaved\
      \ individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused\
      \ on the \ndeceased and possibly about ‘joining’ the deceased, whereas in MDE\
      \ such thoughts are focused on ending one’s \nown life because of feeling worthless,\
      \ undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression. \nSource:\

      \ account or \nobservation by others, for at least 2 years. Note: In children\
      \ and adolescents, mood can be irritable, and \nduration must be at least 1\
      \ year. \nB. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following: \n\
      1. Poor appetite or overeating \n2. Insomnia or hypersomnia \n3. Low energy\
      \ or fatigue \n4. Low self-esteem \n5. Poor concentration or difficulty making\
      \ decisions \n6. Feelings of hopelessness \nC. During the 2-year period (1 year\
      \ for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the individual has never\
      \ been \nwithout the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at\
      \ a time. \nD. Criteria for an MDD may be continuously present for 2 years.\
      \ \nE. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode, and criteria\
      \ have never been met for \ncyclothymic disorder. \nF. The disturbance is not\
      \ better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,\
      \ delusional \ndisorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum\
      \ and other psychotic disorder. \nG. The symptoms are not attributable to the\
      \ physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of misuse, a \nmedication)\
      \ or another medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism). \nH. The symptoms cause\
      \ clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\
      \ other important \nareas of functioning. \nNote: Because the criteria for an\
      \ MDE include four symptoms that are absent from the symptom list for \npersistent\
      \ depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very limited number of individuals will\
      \ have depressive symptoms \nthat have persisted longer than 2 years but will\
      \ not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full \ncriteria for\
      \ an MDE have been met at some point during the current episode of illness,\
      \ they should be given a \ndiagnosis of MDD. Otherwise, a diagnosis of other\

      \ survey indicate the 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of \nDSM-5 MDD\
      \ are 10 percent and 21 percent, respectively (Hasin et al., 2018). Prevalence\
      \ of MDD in \nemerging adults (ages 18 to 29 years) is 3 times higher than the\
      \ prevalence in older adults (ages 60 years \nand older). Women are 1.5 times\
      \ as likely to report depression as men (Hasin et al., 2018).  \nTwelve-month\
      \ and lifetime prevalence rates for DSM-5 PDD in U.S. samples have not been\
      \ reported at \nthe time of this publication. Using DSM-IV criteria, 12-month\
      \ and lifetime prevalence of PDD in U.S. \nadults is estimated at 1.5 percent\
      \ and 3 percent, respectively; DSM-IV dysthymia has an estimated 12-\nmonth\
      \ and lifetime prevalence of 0.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively (Blanco\
      \ et al., 2010). \nDepressive Disorders and SUDs \nDepressive disorders are\
      \ highly comorbid with SUDs. For instance: \n• \nPresence of a 12-month or lifetime\
      \ DSM-5 drug use disorder (i.e., a nonalcohol SUD) is associated \nwith a 1.5\
      \ to 1.9 increased odds of having any mood disorder, a 1.3 to 1.5 increased\
      \ odds of having \ndysthymia, and a 1.2 to 1.3 increased odds of having MDD\
      \ (Grant et al., 2016).  \n• \nTwelve-month alcohol use disorder (AUD) is also\
      \ associated with an increased risk of MDD and \nlifetime AUD with persistent\
      \ depression (Grant et al., 2015).  \n• \nA lifetime diagnosis of DSM-5 MDD\
      \ is more likely to occur in individuals with a history of SUDs (58 \npercent;\
      \ for AUD, 41 percent) than in people with a history of any anxiety disorder\
      \ (37 percent) or \nPD (32 percent) (Hasin et al., 2018). \nPeople with depression\
      \ and co-occurring SUDs tend to have more severe mood symptoms (e.g., sleep\
      \ \ndisturbance, feelings of worthlessness), higher risk of suicidal ideation\
      \ and suicide attempts, worse \nfunctioning, more psychiatric comorbidities,\
      \ and greater disease burden (including increased mortality) \nthan people with\
      \ MDD alone (Blanco et al., 2012; Gadermann, Alonso, Vilagut, Zaslavsky, & Kessler,\
      \ \n2012). They are less likely than people with MDD alone to receive antidepressants—despite\

      \ mood and even some SUD \nsymptoms (Blanco et al., 2012).  \nAddiction counselors\
      \ may represent a way to reduce lags in adequate depression care in people with\
      \ \ndepressive disorders and SUDs. Among 3.3 million people who reported both\
      \ MDEs and SUDs between \n2008 to 2014, only 55 percent received services for\
      \ depression in the previous year (Han, Olfson, & \nMojtabai, 2017). However,\
      \ people who had received SUD treatment in the past year were 1.5 times \nmore\
      \ likely to have received depression care than people who had not engaged in\
      \ SUD treatment (80 \npercent vs. 50 percent, respectively) and were 1.6 times\
      \ more likely to perceive their depressive care as \nbeing helpful (48 percent\
      \ vs. 32 percent) than people who did not access SUD treatment in the previous\
      \ \n12 months (Han et al., 2017). \nOther facts about depression and SUDs that\
      \ addiction counselors should know include: \n• \nBoth substance use and discontinuance\
      \ can be associated with depressive symptoms. \n• \nDuring the first months\
      \ of sobriety, many people with SUDs can exhibit symptoms of depression \nthat\
      \ fade over time and that are related to acute and protracted withdrawal. \n\
      • \nPeople with co-occurring depressive disorders and SUDs typically use a variety\
      \ of drugs.  \n• \nRecent evidence suggests there is increasing cannabis use\
      \ with depression, although cannabinoids \nhave not been shown to be effective\
      \ in self-management of depression. In fact, cannabis may \nactually worsen\
      \ the course of MDD and reduce chances of treatment seeking (Bahorik et al.,\
      \ 2018).  \nTreatment of MDD and SUD \nPsychotherapy (e.g., integrated cognitive–behavioral\
      \ therapy [CBT], group CBT), with or without adjunct \nantidepressant use, can\
      \ effectively reduce frequency of substance use and depressive symptoms and\
      \ \nimprove functioning briefly and over the long term (Paddock, Hunter, & Leininger,\
      \ 2014; Vujanovic et al., \n2017). In a review examining MDD and AUD specifically\
      \ (Riper et al., 2014), treatment as usual \nsupplemented with CBT and motivational\
      \ interviewing had small but significant effects in improving \ndepression and\
      \ decreasing alcohol use versus treatment as usual alone or other brief psychosocial\
      \ \ninterventions.  \nFor more extensive guidance about counseling clients with\
      \ addiction and depression, see TIP 48, \nManaging Depressive Symptoms in Substance\
      \ Abuse Clients During Early Recovery (Center for Substance \nAbuse Treatment\
      \ [CSAT], 2008). \nAdvice to the Counselor: Counseling a Client With a Depressive\
      \ Disorder \n• It is possible that as many as half of the clients an addiction\
      \ counselor sees will have an MDE (Center for \nBehavioral Health Statistics\
      \ and Quality [CBHSQ], 2019). Counselors should expect to encounter depressive\
      \ \nsymptoms and disorders in their work and proactively familiarize themselves\
      \ with diagnostic criteria and \ngeneral treatment approaches. \n• Differentiate\
      \ among commonplace expressions of depression and depression associated with\
      \ more serious \nmental illness (SMI), medical conditions and medication side\
      \ effects, and substance-induced changes. \nUnderstand that it is possible to\
      \ have depressive symptoms without meeting full criteria for MDD or another\
      \ \ndepressive disorder. Distinguishing MDD from normal moods and depressive\
      \ symptoms is also important. \n• Symptoms of depression can persist for 3 to\
      \ 6 months following abstinence and need to be treated in \ncounseling. Educate\
      \ clients about the relationship of depression to substance misuse so that they\
      \ know what \nto expect from treatment and the course of recovery."

      \ not become apparent that a client has \ndepression until after he or she has\
      \ stopped using substances. Monitor symptoms continually and respond \nimmediately\
      \ to any intensification of symptoms.  \n• Clients with depression often feel\
      \ hopeless and unmotivated, which can hinder their participation and \nretention\
      \ in treatment. If clients seem reluctant to engage in SUD treatment, do not\
      \ interpret that as a sign \nof resistance or noncompliance. Alleviating their\
      \ depressive symptoms could help with this to an extent. But \nalso work with\
      \ clients on enhancing motivation and self-efficacy so they can develop confidence\
      \ and \ninternalize the belief that recovery is possible. \n• Gradually introduce\

      \ (if one isn’t available in the treatment setting) to refer clients for \n\
      complete assessment and medication review.  \n• Given that depressive symptoms\
      \ can result from SUDs and not an underlying mental disorder, careful and \n\
      continual assessment is essential. \n• Because of the increased risk of suicidality\
      \ with MDD, continually assess and be vigilant for signs of suicidal \nideation,\
      \ gestures/behaviors, and attempts. Use risk mitigation strategies (e.g., safety\
      \ plans) to protect \nclients from self-harm. (See the section “Cross-Cutting\
      \ Topics: Suicide and Trauma” for more guidance.) \nBipolar I Disorder \nBipolar\
      \ I disorder, also sometimes termed manic-depression, refers to a mental state\
      \ wherein a \nperson’s mood fluctuates wildly between depressive and manic episodes\
      \ (Exhibit 4.3). During depressive \nepisodes, a person experiences symptoms\
      \ of MDD (e.g., excessive sadness, loss of interest in normally \npleasurably\
      \ activities, physical and cognitive symptoms). During manic episodes, a person\
      \ experiences \nthe opposite—extreme euphoria, energy, and activity. Manic episodes\
      \ vary with intensity and can be \nmanifest in a variety of ways, such as having\
      \ little or no need for sleep, very fast or “pressured” speech, \nimpulsivity\
      \ and erratic decision making (especially decisions of major consequence, like\
      \ spending a large \namount of money), and racing thoughts. Some manic episodes\
      \ are milder in nature; these are known as \nhypomanic episodes. People with\
      \ bipolar I disorder can experience both manic and hypomanic episodes. \nBipolar\
      \ II disorder is a related disorder in which the person only experiences hypomania\
      \ and not full-\nblown mania. For the purposes of this chapter, only bipolar\
      \ I disorder, which has ample research \nstrongly linking it to SUDs, will be\
      \ discussed. \nExhibit 4.3. Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar I Disorder \nFor\
      \ a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria\
      \ for a manic episode. The manic \nepisode may have been preceded by and may\
      \ be followed by hypomanic or MDEs. \nManic Episode \nA. A distinct period of\
      \ abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally\
      \ and \npersistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at\
      \ least 1 week and present most of the day, \nnearly every day (or any duration\
      \ if hospitalization is necessary).  \nB. During the period of mood disturbance\
      \ and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following \nsymptoms\
      \ (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and\
      \ represent a noticeable \nchange from usual behavior: \n1. Inflated self-esteem\
      \ or grandiosity"

      \ \n1 In distinguishing grief from an MDE, it is useful to consider that in\
      \ grief the predominant affect is feelings of \nemptiness and loss, while in\
      \ MDE it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness\
      \ or \npleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over\
      \ days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-\ncalled pangs of grief. These waves\
      \ tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The \ndepressed\
      \ mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\
      \ The pain of \ngrief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that\
      \ are uncharacteristic of the pervasive \nunhappiness and misery characteristic\
      \ of MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally features a \n\
      preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical\
      \ or pessimistic \nruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is generally\
      \ preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness \nand self-loathing are\
      \ common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves\
      \ perceived \nfailings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently\
      \ enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she \nwas loved). If a bereaved\
      \ individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused\
      \ on the \ndeceased and possibly about ‘joining’ the deceased, whereas in MDE\
      \ such thoughts are focused on ending one’s \nown life because of feeling worthless,\
      \ undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression. \nSource:\

      Page 84 \nClerici, 2014), leading to a standardized mortality ratio of suicide\
      \ deaths that is 10 to 30 times greater \nthan that of the general population\
      \ (Schaffer et al., 2015). People with bipolar disorder and SUD are \nsignificantly\
      \ more likely to attempt suicide than people without both conditions (Carra\
      \ et al., 2014; \nSchaffer et al., 2015). Interestingly, current or lifetime\
      \ SUD is a significant risk factor for suicide attempt \nin bipolar disorder\
      \ but not suicide death (Schaffer et al., 2015). \nPrevalence  \nThe 12-month\
      \ and lifetime prevalence rates of DSM-5 bipolar I disorder are 1.5 percent\
      \ and 2 percent, \nrespectively (Blanco et al., 2017). Rates are nearly equivalent\
      \ between men and women for both 12-\nmonth and lifetime prevalence (Blanco\
      \ et al., 2017). \nBipolar I Disorder and SUDs \nIndividuals with bipolar I\
      \ have high prevalence (65 percent) of lifetime SUD, AUD (54 percent), and drug\
      \ \nuse disorder (32 percent) (McDermid et al., 2015). Presence of a 12-month\
      \ or lifetime DSM-5 drug use \ndisorder (i.e., an SUD excluding alcohol) is\
      \ associated with a 1.4 to 1.5 increased odds in having bipolar I \ndisorder\
      \ (Grant et al., 2016). Similarly, presence of past-year or lifetime bipolar\
      \ I disorder carries a 2 to \n5.8 times greater risk of also having any 12-month\
      \ or lifetime SUD (Blanco et al., 2017). A systematic \nreview and meta-analysis\
      \ found strong associations between co-occurring SUDs and bipolar illness in\
      \ \nindividuals in clinical settings, with highest prevalence (average: 30 percent)\
      \ for alcohol use, 20 percent \n(mean) for cannabis, and 17 percent (mean) for\
      \ any drug use disorder (Hunt, Malhi, Cleary, Lai, & \nSitharthan, 2016b). \n\
      Co-occurring bipolar illness and substance misuse are associated with numerous\
      \ adverse clinical, social, \nand economic consequences, including increased\
      \ symptom severity, poorer treatment outcomes, and \ngreater suicide risk (Ma,\
      \ Coles, & George, 2018). Presence of a co-occurring SUD with bipolar disorder\
      \ \nhas been linked to lower SUD treatment adherence and retention, protracted\
      \ mood episodes, poorer \nrecovery of functional abilities (even after abstaining\
      \ from substances), increased utilization of \nemergency services, greater hospitalizations,\
      \ more variable disease course, greater affective instability, \nmore impulsivity,\
      \ and poor response to lithium (the standard pharmacotherapy of choice) (Swann,\
      \ 2010; \nTolliver & Anton, 2015).  \nTreatment of Bipolar I Disorder and SUDs\
      \ \nSubstance misuse by those with bipolar disorder complicates diagnosis and\
      \ treatment, in part because \nthere is evidence of a bidirectional relationship\
      \ between bipolar disorder and SUDs, and yet the ways in \nwhich these conditions\
      \ influence one another is still unclear (Tolliver & Anton, 2015). Little research\
      \ has \nexamined nonpharmacological approaches to managing comorbid bipolar\
      \ I disorder and SUDs. Group \nCBT, integrated therapy, and relapse prevention\
      \ techniques may help reduce hospitalizations, increase \nabstinence, improve\
      \ medication adherence, reduce addiction severity, and (to a lesser extent)\
      \ improve \nmood symptoms (Gold et al., 2018). However, results are inconsistent\
      \ across studies, underscoring the \nneed for more research. \nAdvice to the\
      \ Counselor: Counseling a Client With Bipolar I Disorder \n• Although true for\
      \ most counseling situations, it is especially important to maintain a calm\
      \ demeanor and a \nreassuring presence with these clients.  \n• Start low and\
      \ go slow (that is, start “low” with general and nonprovocative topics and proceed\
      \ gradually as \nclients become more comfortable talking about problems).  \n\
      • Monitor symptoms and respond immediately to any intensification."

      Page 85 \n• At every session, strongly emphasize and monitor medication compliance\
      \ and promote medication \nadherence. The cyclical nature of bipolar disorder\
      \ is frequently punctuated by bouts of medication \nnoncompliance, and it is\
      \ crucial to cultivate and convey an understanding of the allure of the manic\
      \ episode. \n• Pay attention to signs of depression or mania, as medication\
      \ might be able to ward off the worsening of the \nclient’s condition. For developing\
      \ mania, which is virtually nonresponsive to psychosocial interventions, a \n\
      variety of mood stabilizers have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. Their timely\
      \ use can avert potentially \nlife­altering, negative events. (See “Pharmacotherapy”\
      \ in Chapter 7.) \n• Although evidence on psychosocial treatments for bipolar\
      \ I disorder and SUD is inconsistent, the strongest \nsupport seems to come\
      \ from the use of integrated group-based interventions that use multiple treatment\
      \ \ncomponents to address both mood and substance-related symptoms. Techniques\
      \ include counseling, relapse \nprevention, psychoeducation, medication management,\
      \ and regular phone or in-person “check-in” sessions \nto monitor symptoms and\
      \ treatment progress. \n• Gradually introduce and teach skills for participation\
      \ in mutual support programs.  \n• Combine addiction counseling with medication\
      \ and mental health services.  \n• Suicide and suicidal behaviors are major\
      \ ongoing concerns for this client population, and the addiction \ncounselor\
      \ should have a thorough understanding of her or his role in preventing suicide.\
      \ \n \nCase Study: Counseling an SUD treatment Client With Bipolar I Disorder\
      \ \nJohn W. is a 30-year-old man with bipolar I disorder and AUD. He has a history\
      \ of hospitalizations, both \npsychiatric and substance related; after the most\
      \ recent extended psychiatric hospitalization, he was referred \nfor SUD treatment.\
      \ He told the counselor he used alcohol to facilitate social contact, as well\
      \ as deal with \nboredom, because he had not been able to work for some time.\
      \ The counselor learned that during his early 20s, \nJohn W. achieved full-time\
      \ employment and established an intimate relationship with a nondrinking woman;\
      \ \nhowever, his drinking led to the loss of both. \nDuring one of his alcohol\
      \ treatments, he developed florid manic symptoms, believing himself to be a\
      \ prophet \nwith the power to heal others. He was transferred to a closed psychiatric\
      \ unit, where he eventually stabilized on \na combination of antipsychotic medications\
      \ (risperidone) and lithium. Since that time, he has had two episodes \nof worsening\
      \ psychiatric symptoms leading to hospitalization; each of these began with\
      \ drinking, which then led \nto stopping his medications, then florid mania\
      \ and psychiatric commitment. However, when he is taking his \nmedications and\
      \ is sober, John W. has a normal mental status and relates normally to others.\
      \ Recently, \nfollowing a series of stressors, John W. left his girlfriend,\
      \ quit his job, and began using alcohol heavily again. He \nrapidly relapsed\
      \ to active mania, did not adhere to a medication regimen, and was rehospitalized.\
      \ \nAt the point John W. is introduced to the SUD treatment counselor, his mental\
      \ status is fairly normal; however, \nhe warns the counselor that after manic\
      \ episodes he tends to get somewhat depressed, even when he is taking \nmedications.\
      \ The counselor takes an addiction history and finds that John W. has had several\
      \ periods of a year \nor two during which he was abstinent from alcohol and\
      \ drugs of misuse, but he has never had ongoing alcohol \ntreatment or attended\
      \ Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. John W. replies to the counselor’s questions\
      \ about \nthis with, “Well, if I just take my meds and don’t drink, I’m fine.\
      \ So why do I need those meetings?” \nUsing a motivational approach, the counselor\
      \ helps John W. analyze what has worked best for him in dealing \nwith both\
      \ addiction and mental problems, as well as what has not worked well for him.\
      \ John W. is tired of the \nmerry-go-round of his life; he certainly acknowledges\
      \ that he has a major mental disorder, but thinks his \ndrinking is only secondary\
      \ to the mania. When the counselor gently points out that each of the episodes\
      \ in \nwhich his mental disorder led to hospitalization began with an alcohol\
      \ relapse, John W. begins to listen. In a \ngroup for clients with CODs at the\
      \ SUD treatment agency, John W. is introduced to another client in recovery\
      \ \nwith a bipolar disorder, who tells his personal story and how he discovered\
      \ that both of his problems need \nprimary attention. This client agrees to\
      \ be John W.’s temporary sponsor and calls John W.’s case manager, who \nworks\
      \ at the mental health center where John W. gets his medication, and describes\
      \ the treatment plan. She \nthen makes arrangements for a monthly meeting involving\
      \ the counselor, case manager, and John W. \nDiscussion: The SUD treatment counselor\
      \ has taken the wise step of taking a detailed history and attempting to \n\
      establish the linkage between CODs. The counselor tries to appreciate the client’s\
      \ own understanding of the"

      \ \nPTSD  \nPTSD is an exaggerated fear response that occurs following exposure\
      \ to one or more extremely \nupsetting events. Such events can include, but\
      \ are not limited to, war, terrorist attack, threatened or \nactual physical\
      \ or sexual violence, being kidnapped, natural and man-made disasters, and serious\
      \ motor \nvehicle accidents. Events may be experienced firsthand, witnessed,\
      \ experienced through repeated \nexposure as a part of one’s job (e.g., police\
      \ officers repeatedly hearing details about child abuse, \nmurder, and other\
      \ violent and upsetting crimes), or by learning about such events occurring\
      \ to a close \nloved one (e.g., learning of the murder of one’s child). People\
      \ with PTSD report the most distressing \ntrauma to be sexual abuse before age\
      \ 18 years (Goldstein et al., 2016). \nSymptoms of PTSD are grouped into four\
      \ categories:  \n• \nIntrusive, persistent re-experiences of the trauma, including\
      \ recurrent dreams or nightmares, \nflashbacks, and distressing memories \n\
      • \nPersistent avoidance of people, places, objects, and events that remind\
      \ the person of the trauma or \notherwise trigger distressing memories, thoughts,\
      \ feelings, and physiological reactions  \n• \nNegative alterations in cognitions\
      \ and mood, such as memory loss (particularly regarding details \nsurrounding\
      \ the event), self-blame, guilt, hopelessness, social withdrawal, and an inability\
      \ to \nexperience positive emotions \n• \nMarked alterations in arousal and\
      \ reactivity, such as experiencing sleeplessness or feeling “jumpy,” \n“on edge,”\
      \ easily started, irritable, angry, or unable to concentrate \nExhibit 4.4 lists\

      \ The following criteria apply to adults, adolescents, and children older than\
      \ 6 years. \nA. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual\
      \ violence in one (or more) of these ways:  \n1. Directly experiencing the traumatic\
      \ event(s) \n2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others\
      \  \n3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member\
      \ or close friend. In cases of actual \nor threatened death of a family member\
      \ or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or accidental.  \n4. Experiencing\
      \ repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s)\
      \ (e.g., first \nresponders collecting human remains; police officers repeatedly\
      \ exposed to details of child abuse) \nNote: Criterion A4 does not apply to\
      \ exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures, unless\
      \ \nthis exposure is work related.  \nB. Presence of one (or more) of the following\
      \ intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic events(s), \nbeginning after\
      \ the traumatic event(s) occurred: \n1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive\
      \ distressing memories of the traumatic event(s)"

      \ PTSD are 4.7 percent and 6.1 percent, \nrespectively (Goldstein et al., 2016).\
      \ Rates are markedly higher among women than men, about 6 \npercent and 8 percent\
      \ for past-year and lifetime PTSD, respectively (Goldstein et al., 2016). Lifetime\
      \ \nprevalence is even higher for female veterans (13.9 percent) and younger\
      \ adults (ages 18 to 29 years, \n15.3 percent) (Smith, Goldstein, & Grant, 2016).\
      \ A 2016 study of veterans using DSM-5 criteria found the \nlifetime prevalence\
      \ of PTSD to be 6.9 percent, with significantly higher prevalence rates noted\
      \ for \nwomen and younger age groups (Smith et al., 2016).  \nIndividuals in\
      \ occupations at risk of exposure to traumatic events (e.g., police, firefighters,\
      \ emergency \nmedical personnel) have higher rates of PTSD. Among high-risk\
      \ individuals (those who have survived \nrape, military combat, and captivity\
      \ or ethnically or politically motivated internment and genocide), the \nproportion\
      \ of those with PTSD ranges from one-third to one-half (APA, 2013).  \nPTSD\
      \ and SUDs \nThere is a strong association between PTSD and substance misuse,\
      \ including lifetime SUDs (Hasin & \nKilcoyne, 2012), lifetime drug use disorders\
      \ (Grant et al., 2016), and lifetime AUD (Grant et al., 2015). \nAmong people\
      \ with SUDs, lifetime prevalence of PTSD is thought to range between 26 percent\
      \ and 52 \npercent and rates of current PTSD between 15 percent and 42 percent\
      \ (Vujanovic, Bonn-Miller, & Petry, \n2016). Among people with PTSD, lifetime\
      \ rates of SUD are likely between 36 percent and 52 percent \n(Vujanovic et\
      \ al., 2016). Presence of a 12-month or lifetime DSM-5 drug use disorder (i.e.,\
      \ an SUD \nexcluding alcohol) is associated with a 1.5 to 1.6 increased odds\
      \ of having PTSD (Grant et al., 2016). \nSimilarly, presence of 12-month or\
      \ lifetime PTSD is associated with a 1.3 to 1.5 increased odds of having \n\
      a past-year or lifetime SUD (Goldstein et al., 2016).  \nComorbid PTSD and addiction\
      \ are highly complex and associated with worse treatment outcomes \n(including\
      \ lower rates of remission and faster relapse), poorer treatment response, more\
      \ cognitive \nH. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects\
      \ of a substance (e.g., medication, alcohol) or \nanother medical condition.\

      \ mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling\
      \ \na sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly) \n2. Derealization:\
      \ Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g., the\
      \ world around the \nindividual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, distant,\
      \ or distorted) \nNote: To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must\
      \ not be attributable to the physiological effects of a \nsubstance (e.g., blackouts,\

      \ and heightened mortality (Flanagan, \nKorte, Killeen, & Back, 2016; Schumm\
      \ & Gore, 2016). Compared with people with PTSD or alcohol \ndependence alone,\
      \ those with both report more traumatic childhoods, more psychiatric comorbidities,\
      \ \nan increased risk of suicide, more severe symptoms, and greater disability\
      \ (Blanco et al., 2013). \nPeople with PTSD tend to misuse the most serious\
      \ substances (cocaine and opioids); however, misuse of \nprescription medications,\
      \ cannabis, and alcohol also are common.  \nWarning to Counselors: PTSD or Depression?\
      \ \nMany people with PTSD are mistakenly diagnosed with depression, particularly\
      \ in SUD treatment settings where \nscreening for trauma is low. There is a\
      \ high comorbidity between the two conditions. Symptoms can overlap to \nan\
      \ extent, and when occurring together, the combination results in greater symptom\
      \ severity than either \ndisorder alone (Post, Feeny, Zoellner, & Connell, 2016).\
      \ Subclinical traumatic stress reactions are commonly \nexpressed as depressive\
      \ symptoms. However, PTSD has unique treatment needs and a different disease\
      \ course \nand treatment response than depression. When working with someone\
      \ with a depressive disorder diagnosis \nwho also has a history of trauma, consider\
      \ screening for PTSD to gauge whether a referral for diagnostic \nassessment\
      \ might be warranted.  \nTreatment of PTSD and SUDs \nHistorically, there has\
      \ been debate about whether to treat PTSD and addiction concurrently or \nsequentially,\
      \ with most providers falling on the side of treating the SUD separately and\
      \ first (Schumm & \nGore, 2016). Some believe that substance misuse among people\
      \ with PTSD is a means of self-medicating \nto help manage distressing mood\
      \ and anxiety symptoms, thus making PTSD the priority target for \ntreatment.\
      \ Alternatively, others have feared that treating PTSD first could exacerbate\
      \ SUD symptoms or \ncause clients to use substances as a means of coping with\
      \ the hyperarousal and negative mood that can \noccur while progressing through\
      \ PTSD treatment. However, integrated, concurrent treatment that \naddresses\
      \ both conditions simultaneously has generated strong empirical support, appears\
      \ to be \npreferable to clients, and is increasingly considered the current\
      \ standard of care, particularly when \ncombining psychosocial and pharmacologic\
      \ approaches (Flanagan et al., 2016; Schumm & Gore, 2016; \nSimpson, Lehavot,\
      \ & Petrakis, 2017).  \nExposure therapy can be safe and effective at reducing\
      \ trauma and SUD symptoms—although more \nevidence is needed (Flanagan et al.,\
      \ 2016). Nonexposure-based treatments have been studied more \nwidely for co-occurring\
      \ PTSD and SUD and may be moderately effective at improving both PTSD and \n\
      substance symptoms, but the evidence is still premature (Flanagan et al., 2016).\
      \ A Cochrane Review \nfound individual trauma-focused psychotherapy with adjunctive\
      \ SUD treatment to be effective at \nreducing posttreatment PTSD severity and\
      \ substance use at 5 to 7 months following treatment; \nhowever, the authors\
      \ deemed the current evidence base on psychological treatments for PTSD-SUD\
      \ to \nbe weak in terms of quality and methodology, underscoring the need for\
      \ more rigorous research in this \narea (Roberts, Roberts, Jones, & Bisson,\
      \ 2016). Studies of pharmacologic treatments for SUD with PTSD, \nand for AUD\
      \ specifically, appear encouraging but, again, are understudied, often inconclusive,\
      \ and \nrequire more data (Flanagan et al., 2016; Petrakis & Simpson, 2017).\
      \ \nDespite the evidence that concurrent treatment can be effective, people\
      \ with PTSD and SUD are frequently only \ntreated for addiction; further, clients\
      \ in SUD treatment settings are often not even assessed for PTSD \n(Vujanovic\
      \ et al., 2016). Whereas treating SUD alone rarely leads to improvement in PTSD\
      \ symptoms, reducing \nPTSD symptoms can significantly decrease the odds of\
      \ heavy substance (Hien et al., 2010)."

      \ end of this chapter for more \ninformation about trauma-informed care for\
      \ people with CODs. \nAdvice to the Counselor: Counseling a Client With PTSD\
      \ \n• As a counselor, it is important to recognize, and help clients understand,\
      \ that becoming abstinent from \nsubstances does not resolve PTSD; both disorders\
      \ must be addressed in treatment. \n• Treatment of PTSD with co­occurring SUDs\
      \ requires careful planning and supervision.  \n− As the client faces painful\
      \ trauma memories, the desire for intoxication can be overwhelming. By \nexploring\
      \ trauma memories, well-intentioned counselors inadvertently may drive a client\
      \ back to the \nsubstance by urging her to “tell her story” or “let out the\
      \ abuse.” Even if a client wants to discuss trauma \nand seems safe during the\
      \ session, aftereffects may well ensue, including a flood of memories the client\
      \ is \nunprepared to handle, increased suicidality, and “retraumatization” (feeling\
      \ like one is reliving the event).  \n− Such treatment approaches should be\
      \ undertaken only with adequate formal training in both PTSD and \nsubstance\
      \ misuse and only under careful clinical supervision. \n• These clients need\
      \ stability in their primary therapeutic relationship; hence, this work should\
      \ not be \nundertaken in settings with high staff turnover and never without\
      \ training and supervision.  \n• Do not try to provide trauma exploration treatment\
      \ in view of the potential for highly destabilizing effects \n(including worsening\
      \ of substance misuse).  \n• Provide present­focused psychoeducation about PSTD,\
      \ such as teaching the client to recognize symptoms of \nthe disorder and how\
      \ to cope with them.  \n• Clinicians are advised not to overlook the possibility\
      \ of PTSD in men. \n• People with PTSD and substance misuse are more likely\
      \ to experience further trauma than people with \nsubstance misuse alone. \n\
      • Repeated trauma is common in domestic violence, child abuse, and some substance-using\
      \ lifestyles (e.g., the \ndrug trade), so helping the client protect against\
      \ future trauma may be an important part of treatment. \n• Anticipate proceeding\
      \ slowly with a client who is diagnosed with or has symptoms of PTSD. Consider\
      \ the \neffect of a trauma history on the client’s current emotional state,\
      \ such as an increased level of fear, \ndepressed mood, or irritability.  \n\
      • Trauma begets more trauma, as people with PTSD are at an increased risk of\
      \ revictimization. Discuss with \nclients this increased risk, how to recognize\
      \ and avoid threatening situations, and how substance use plays a \nrole in\
      \ increasing their vulnerability to revictimization.  \n• Develop a plan for\
      \ increased safety if warranted.  \n• Respond more to the client’s behavior\
      \ than his or her words.  \n• Limit questioning about details of trauma.  \n\
      • Recognize that trauma injures an individual’s capacity for attachment. The\
      \ establishment of a trusting \ntreatment relationship will be a goal of treatment,\
      \ not a starting point.  \n• Recognize the importance of one’s own trauma history\
      \ and countertransference.  \n• Help the client learn to deescalate intense\
      \ emotions.  \n• Help the client understand the link between PTSD and substance\
      \ use by providing psychoeducation.  \n• Teach coping skills to control PTSD\
      \ symptoms.  \n• Recognize that PTSD/SUD treatment clients may have a more difficult\
      \ time in treatment and that treatment \nfor PTSD may be long term, especially\
      \ for those who have a history of serious trauma.  \n• Help the client access\
      \ long-term PTSD treatment and refer to trauma experts for trauma exploratory\
      \ work.  \n• Given the high prevalence of self-harm in this population, counselors\
      \ should screen for suicide risk early on in \ntreatment and throughout the\
      \ course of care. Risk of suicide in people with PTSD is correlated with a history"

      \ ones concerning negative mood \nand cognitions (Criterion D in DSM-5 diagnostic\
      \ criteria). \nPDs \nA PD refers to a person’s lifelong inability to form healthy,\
      \ functional relationships with others and a \nfailure to develop an adaptive\
      \ sense of self. These are manifest as (a) destructive or otherwise \nproblematic\
      \ patterns of thinking and feeling about oneself, one’s place in the world,\
      \ and others and (b) \nnegative ways of behaving toward others. People with\
      \ PDs often lack insight into their dysfunctional \ncognitive, emotional, and\
      \ behavioral patterns and often blame others or the world in general for their\
      \ \ndifficulties. Many people with PDs struggle to develop strong, positive\
      \ relationships, because they view \nreality from the perspective of their own\
      \ needs and therefore have a difficult time understanding, \nempathizing with,\
      \ and connecting with others. PDs are lifelong conditions that develop in adolescence\
      \ \nor early adulthood. They are frequently resistant to change and result in\
      \ significant impairments in \ninterpersonal functioning, work/school performance,\
      \ and self-concept. \nThere are several types of PDs, and the precise symptoms\
      \ someone exhibits will depend on which type \nof PD he or she has. For instance,\
      \ depending on the PD type, an individual might think of himself/herself \n\
      in overly negative ways or in grandiose ways, might be overly attached to others\
      \ or completely \nindifferent to others, might constantly try to be the center\
      \ of attention or might be socially reclusive. \nPeople with PDs must first\
      \ meet the diagnostic criteria for a general PD (Exhibit 4.5) and then must\
      \ meet \nadditional diagnostic criteria for whatever PD type is most appropriate\
      \ given their symptoms. Many \nindividuals with PDs have features of, or meet\
      \ full criteria for, other PDs. \nCase Study: Counseling an SUD treatment Client\
      \ Who Binge Drinks and Has PTSD \nCaitlin P. is a 17-year-old Native American\
      \ woman admitted to an inpatient SUD treatment program after she \ntried to\
      \ kill herself during a drunken episode. She has been binge drinking since age\
      \ 12 and also has tried a wide \nvariety of pills without caring what she is\
      \ taking. She has a history of depression and burning her arms with \ncigarettes.\
      \ She was the victim of a date rape at age 15 and did not tell anyone but a\
      \ close friend. She did not tell \nher family for fear that they would think\
      \ less of her for not preventing or fighting off the attack. \nIn treatment,\
      \ she worked with staff to try to gain control over her repeated self-destructive\
      \ behavior. Together \nthey worked on developing compassion for herself, created\
      \ a safety plan to encourage her to reach out for help \nwhen in distress, and\
      \ began a log to help her identify her PTSD symptoms so that she could recognize\
      \ them \nmore clearly. When she had the urge to drink, drug, or burn herself,\
      \ she was guided to try to “bring down” the \nfeelings through grounding, rethink\
      \ the situation, and reassure herself that she could get through it. She began\
      \ \nto see that her substance use had been a way to numb the pain. \nDiscussion:\
      \ Counselors can help clients gain control over PTSD symptoms and self-destructive\
      \ behavior \nassociated with trauma. Providing specific coping strategies and\
      \ lots of encouragement typically appeals to \nPTSD/SUD treatment clients, who\
      \ may want to learn how to overcome the emotional rollercoaster of their \n\
      disorders. Notice that in such early-phase treatment, detailed exploration of\
      \ the past is not generally advised.  \nFor more information about working with\
      \ American Indian and Alaska Native clients who have SUDs or CODs, \nsee TIP\

      Page 92 \nThis TIP provides details about the two PD types that are commonly\
      \ comorbid with addiction—BPD and \nantisocial PD (ASPD). Before exploring BPD\
      \ and ASPD in detail, an overview of PDs in general follows. \nReaders should\
      \ be aware that the diagnostic approach to PDs continues to undergo refinement,\
      \ as \nresearchers in psychopathology have expressed many concerns about the\
      \ meaningfulness, gender bias, \naccuracy, and utility of the current categorical\
      \ diagnostic system for PDs (see Section III of DSM-5 for \nmore information\
      \ on alternative PD classification and diagnostic criteria).  \nWarning to Counselors:\
      \ PDs and Provider Stigma \nPDs are among the most stigmatized of all mental\
      \ disorders (Sheehan, Nieweglowski, & Corrigan, 2016). Primary \ncare, mental\
      \ health, and SUD treatment professionals sometimes have contemptuous attitudes\
      \ toward PDs and \nthe people who live with them. They may think or say things\
      \ such as: \n• “These people cannot be treated, so why bother?” \n• “I see PDs\
      \ all the time, especially in women.” \n• “Most people with addiction also have\
      \ a PD.” \n• “It is not worth the time to try to diagnose or treat someone with\
      \ a PD because nothing can be done for \nthem anyway.” \n• “I don’t accept referrals\
      \ for clients like that because they’re too much work and can’t be helped.”\
      \ \n• “Most antisocial people are criminals and are just going to end up in\
      \ prison.” \n• “People with ASPD are ‘psychopaths’ (or ‘sociopaths’).” \n• “These\
      \ people are just manipulative liars; they don’t really want to get better or\
      \ want my help.” \n• “That wasn’t a real suicide attempt. She’s borderline—she’s\
      \ just seeking attention.” \nIt is true that PDs are lifelong disorders, can\
      \ be challenging to work with, and may be more resistant to change \nthan other\
      \ mental disorders or SUDs. But that does not mean that counselors cannot offer\
      \ people with these \nconditions any relief, and it does not mean that people\
      \ with PDs cannot improve their symptoms. Addiction \nprofessionals can help\
      \ clients with PDs reduce substance misuse, which in turn can indirectly help\
      \ improve \nfunctioning and quality of life by reducing risky behavior and enhancing\
      \ health. \nCounselors can combat stigma and prejudice by: \nA. An enduring\
      \ pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations\
      \ of the \nindividual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more)\
      \ of the following areas:  \n1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting\
      \ self, other people, and events)  \n2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity,\
      \ lability, and appropriateness of emotional response)  \n3. Interpersonal functioning\
      \  \n4. Impulse control  \nB. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive\
      \ across a broad range of personal and social situations.  \nC. The enduring\
      \ pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social,\
      \ occupational, or other \nimportant areas of functioning.  \nD. The pattern\
      \ is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least\
      \ to adolescence or early \nadulthood.  \nE. The enduring pattern is not better\
      \ explained as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder.  \n\
      F. The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects of\
      \ a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a \nmedication) or another medical condition\
      \ (e.g., head trauma). \nSource: APA (2013, pp. 646–647). Reprinted with permission\

      Page 93 \n• Becoming familiar with the latest evidence in support of PD treatment.\
      \ The notion that these disorders are \ncompletely intractable is untrue. Even\
      \ in the absence of validated treatments for the PD itself, interventions \n\
      can still help reduce disabling symptoms and CODs, including co-occurring addiction.\
      \  \n• Engaging in honest self-reflection about their own views of and attitudes\
      \ about PDs. Talking to a clinical \nsupervisor, or even engaging in brief counseling\
      \ themselves, can foster self-awareness and behavior change.  \n• Remembering\
      \ that stereotypes can be dangerous and affect how counselors serve (or do not\
      \ serve) the \nclients who need them. All people, regardless of symptoms or\
      \ diagnoses, deserve health and happiness. \nPD Clusters \nOnce a person meets\
      \ criteria for a general PD, his or her diagnosis is further categorized based\
      \ on \nseveral specific PD types, including paranoid PD, schizoid PD, schizotypal\
      \ PD, histrionic PD, narcissistic \nPD, ASPD, BPD, avoidant PD, dependent PD,\
      \ and obsessive-compulsive PD. If the symptoms do not meet \nany of the types,\
      \ he or she can be diagnosed with either unspecified PD or other specified PD.\
      \ Detailed \ndescriptions and criteria for all 10 PD types can be found in DSM-5.\
      \ Descriptions and criteria for ASPD \nand all the PD types, BPD and ASPD most\
      \ frequently co-occur with substance misuse (Köck & Walter, \n2018). Thus, they\
      \ are included in this chapter and discussed in respective subsections.  \n\
      In DSM­5, PD types are categorized into three distinct clusters based on their\
      \ common features: \n• \nCluster A PDs describe people who may be seen as odd\
      \ or eccentric. This eccentricity can express \nitself in many ways (e.g., paranoia\
      \ and suspicion, extreme social withdrawal/lack of interest in \ninterpersonal\
      \ relationships, unusual beliefs or behaviors). PD types included in this cluster\
      \ are:  \n− Paranoid PD. \n− Schizoid PD. \n− Schizotypal PD. \n• \nCluster\
      \ B PDs are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional, and erratic and unpredictable\
      \ \nbehavior. PD types included in this cluster are: \n− Histrionic PD. \n−\
      \ Narcissistic PD. \n− ASPD. \n− BPD. \n• \nCluster C PDs are marked by anxious\
      \ and fearful behaviors. PD types included in this cluster are: \n− Obsessive-compulsive\
      \ PD. \n− Avoidant PD. \n− Dependent PD. \nPrevalence \nPrevalence estimates\
      \ for PDs among the general population are difficult to ascertain, given lack\
      \ of \nresearch examining large samples from the community (as opposed to clinical\
      \ samples, in which PDs are \nfar more common and frequently studied). Estimates\
      \ are 9.1 percent for any PD, 5.7 percent for any \nCluster A PD, 1.5 percent\
      \ for any Cluster B, and 6 percent for Cluster C (APA, 2013). In one analysis\
      \ of \nthe National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC),\
      \ the prevalence of \nlifetime DSM-IV PDs varied from 0.5 percent to 7.9 percent,\
      \ depending on the PD type (Hasin & Grant, \n2015). Prevalence rates for BPD\
      \ and ASPD are discussed in separate sections."

      Page 94 \nDiagnostic criteria for PDs have long been debated among psychopathology\
      \ researchers and clinicians, \ngiven multiple problems with the way PDs are\
      \ classified and diagnosed (Paris, 2014; Sarkar & Duggan, \n2010). Problems\
      \ include a lack of empirical evidence supporting PDs; the extensive overlap\
      \ between \ndiagnostic criteria among the specific types of PDs as well as overlap\
      \ with other mental disorders; the \nfact that PD criteria are insufficiently\
      \ discriminant, which has resulted in many individuals who exhibit \nPD pathology\
      \ receiving a DSM-IV “personality disorder not otherwise specified” diagnosis\
      \ after failing to \n“fit in” to any of the specified PD types; and the difficulty\
      \ mental health professionals have in \ndistinguishing PD traits from variants\
      \ of normal personality, which means deciding whether or not a \nperson meets\
      \ PD criteria is often a subjective judgment call. Thus, it is hard to know\
      \ exactly how many \npeople have a PD, including how many people with addiction\
      \ have co-occurring PDs (Paris, 2014). \nPDs and SUDs \nSUD counselors frequently\
      \ see people with PD diagnoses in their treatment settings. A review found the\
      \ \nprevalence of PDs among people with SUDs to be wide ranging but nonetheless\
      \ extremely high, varying \nfrom about 35 percent to 65 percent; rates of ASPD\
      \ ranged from about 14 percent to almost 35 percent \n(Köck & Walter, 2018).\
      \ Similarly, among people undergoing detoxification for AUD, rates of co-occurring\
      \ \nPDs vary widely from 5 percent to 87 percent (Newton-Howes & Foulds, 2018).\
      \ PDs may be present in as \nmuch as 24 percent of people with AUD in the general\
      \ population (Newton-Howes & Foulds, 2018). \nPeople with PDs and SUDs differ\
      \ from those with PDs only or SUDs only in important ways (Köck & \nWalter,\
      \ 2018), including more severe mental and substance-related symptoms, longer\
      \ persisting \nsubstance use, a greater likelihood of other co-occurring mental\
      \ disorders (e.g., anxiety, depressive, and \neating disorders), increased mortality,\
      \ and higher SUD treatment dropout.  \nFor most people with SUDs, drugs eventually\
      \ become more important than jobs, friends, family, and even \nchildren. These\
      \ changes in priorities often appear similar to a PD, but diagnostic clarity\
      \ for PDs in general is \ndifficult. For clients with substance-related disorders,\
      \ the true diagnostic picture might not emerge for weeks or \nmonths. It is\
      \ not unusual for PD symptoms to clear with abstinence, sometimes even fairly\
      \ early in recovery. \nTreatment for PDs and SUDs \nThere are no evidence-based\
      \ treatments for PDs themselves (Bateman, Gunderson, & Mulder, 2015), \nbut\
      \ effective treatments are available to address a variety of PD symptoms, including\
      \ risk of suicide and \nself-harm, affective dysregulation, maladaptive thought\
      \ patterns, and poor interpersonal functioning. \nPsychotherapy is the primary\
      \ form of intervention, as there are no approved medications for the \ntreatment\
      \ of PDs. Pharmacotherapy may be useful as an adjunctive treatment for certain\
      \ symptoms like \naffective lability, impulsivity, and psychosis, but it is\
      \ not useful as a primary intervention. (See the \nsection “Pharmacotherapy”\
      \ in Chapter 7 for more information.) Dialectical behavioral therapy, dynamic\
      \ \ndeconstructive psychotherapy, and dual-focused schema therapy appear promising,\
      \ particularly for BPD, \nand have shown to positively affect psychiatric and\
      \ addiction-related outcomes, although, in general, \nthe research literature\
      \ on effective treatments for PDs, with or without co-occurring SUD, is sparse\
      \ and \nrequires further evidence (Bateman et al., 2015; Köck & Walter, 2018).\
      \  \nAdvice to the Counselor: Counseling a Client With a PD \n• Clients with\
      \ PDs tend to be limited in their ability to receive, accept, or benefit from\
      \ corrective feedback. \n• A further difficulty is the strong countertransference\
      \ providers can have in working with these clients, who \nmay be adept at igniting\
      \ reactions in a variety of ways. Specific concerns will, however, vary according\
      \ to the \nspecific PD and other individual circumstances."

      Page 95 \n• PDs may cause difficulty forming genuinely positive therapeutic\
      \ alliances. Some clients tend to frame reality \nin terms of their own needs\
      \ and perceptions and not to understand the perspectives of others.  \n• The\
      \ course and severity of PDs can be worsened by the presence of other mental\
      \ disorders, such as \ndepressive, anxiety, and psychotic disorders. Be sure\
      \ to offer empirical treatments for co-occurring \nconditions as well as the\
      \ primary PD and SUD. \n• To get the best outcomes possible for clients with\
      \ PDs and co-occurring SUDs, treatment should address both \nconditions to the\
      \ extent possible and should not neglect one disorder over the other. \nBPD\
      \ \nThe essential feature of BPD is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal\
      \ relationships, self-\nimage, and affects, along with marked impulsivity, that\
      \ begins by early adulthood and is present in a \nvariety of contexts (Exhibit\
      \ 4.6). Relationships with others are likely to be unstable—for instance, people\
      \ \nwith BPD might remark how wonderful an individual is one day but express\
      \ intense anger, disapproval, \ncondemnation, and even hate toward that same\
      \ individual a week later. The severe instability people \nwith BPD experience\
      \ includes fluctuating views and feelings about themselves. Those with BPD often\
      \ \nfeel good about themselves and their progress and optimistic about their\
      \ future for a few days or weeks, \nonly to have a seemingly minor experience\
      \ turn their world upside down, with concomitant plunging \nself-esteem and\
      \ depressing hopelessness. This instability often extends to work and school.\
      \  \nWhen experiencing emotional states they cannot handle, clients with BPD\
      \ can be at high risk of suicidal, \nself-mutilating, or brief psychotic states.\
      \ About three-fourths of people with BPD have a history of self-\nharm, and\
      \ the disorder carries a 10 percent lifetime risk of completed suicide (Antai-Otong,\
      \ 2016).  \nExhibit 4.6. Diagnostic Criteria for BPD \nA pervasive pattern of\
      \ instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked\
      \ impulsivity, \nbeginning by early adulthood and present in various contexts,\
      \ as indicated by five (or more) of the following:  \n1. Frantic efforts to\
      \ avoid real or imagined abandonment (Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating\
      \ \nbehavior covered in Criterion 5.)  \n2. A pattern of unstable and intense\
      \ interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between \nextremes\
      \ of idealization and devaluation  \n3. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently\
      \ unstable self-image or sense of self  \n4. Impulsivity in at least two areas\
      \ that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse,\
      \ \nreckless driving, binge eating) (Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating\
      \ behavior covered in \nCriterion 5.)  \n5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures,\
      \ or threats, or self-mutilating behavior  \n6. Affective instability due to\
      \ a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability,\
      \ or \nanxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)\
      \  \n7. Chronic feelings of emptiness  \n8. Inappropriate, intense anger or\
      \ difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant\
      \ \nanger, recurrent physical fights)  \n9. Transient, stress-related paranoid\
      \ ideation or severe dissociative symptoms  \nSource: APA (2013, p. 663). Reprinted\

      Page 96 \nPrevalence  \nBPD has a prevalence of 1.6 percent to 5.9 percent in\
      \ the general population but is more common in \nmental health settings (about\
      \ a 10-percent prevalence rate for outpatient mental health clinics, about \n\
      20 percent among psychiatric inpatients, and 6 percent in primary care settings)\
      \ (APA, 2013). Lifetime \nprevalence of DSM-IV BPD is 5.9 percent (Hasin & Grant,\
      \ 2015).  \nWomen are much more likely to be diagnosed with BPD, generally at\
      \ 3 times the rate of men (i.e., about \n75 percent of cases are women) (APA,\
      \ 2013). However, the accuracy of this pattern is dubious as \nepidemiologic\
      \ surveys of the U.S. general population have found the lifetime prevalence\
      \ of BPD does \nnot actually differ significantly between men and women (Hasin\
      \ & Grant, 2015).  \nWarning to Counselors: The Misdiagnosis of BPD \nPDs can\
      \ be difficult to diagnose. BPD is especially prone to misdiagnosis, particularly\
      \ among women. Reasons \nfor incorrect diagnosis (or, alternatively, failure\
      \ to diagnose) are numerous and include (Fruzzetti, 2017): \n• Stigma surrounding\
      \ the disorder may lead providers to refuse to diagnose it or to be overzealous\
      \ in \ndiagnosing it (the latter, especially in women who are “emotional,” unstable,\
      \ argumentative, or in crisis). \n• Symptoms of BPD—including emotional lability,\
      \ suicidality, and impulsive behaviors—that are also present in \nfull or in\
      \ part in many other disorders, including MDD, bipolar disorder, PTSD, SUDs,\
      \ and more. This makes it \ndifficult to disentangle BPD from other illnesses.\
      \ \n• The incorrect belief that BPD is not treatable, which may make clinicians\
      \ less likely to give the diagnosis, \nespecially when they believe that symptoms\
      \ reflect a different disorder, like depression or PTSD. \n• Women being significantly\
      \ more likely to receive a BPD diagnosis because of gender bias. \nBPD and SUDs\
      \ \nBPD is highly prevalent in SUD treatment settings (and especially inpatient\
      \ and residential treatment), \nwith rates averaging about 22 percent across\
      \ multiple studies but as high as 53 percent in some \nresearch (Trull et al.,\
      \ 2018). Presence of a 12-month or lifetime DSM-5 drug use disorder (i.e., an\
      \ SUD \nexcluding alcohol) is associated with a 1.7 to 1.8 increased odds of\
      \ having BPD (Grant et al., 2016). \nApproximately 45 percent of individuals\
      \ with BPD also have a current SUD, and about 75 percent have a \nlifetime SUD\
      \ (Trull et al., 2018). Opioids, cocaine, and alcohol are the substances with\
      \ the strongest \nassociations with BPD (Trull et al., 2018). \nTreatment of\
      \ BPD and SUDs \nPeople with BPD typically seek behavioral health services based\
      \ on their current life conditions and \nemotional state. Those who seeks mental\
      \ health services tend to be acutely emotionally distraught, \nneeding some\
      \ relief from how they feel. Similarly, those who chooses (or are directed to\
      \ choose) a \nprogram are likely experiencing the SUD as the immediate target\
      \ for treatment. Consequently, the \naverage admission of a person with BPD\
      \ to a mental health program may be considerably different from \nthe average\
      \ admission of a person with BPD to an SUD treatment program. \nIn inpatient\
      \ mental health service settings, dialectical behavior therapy for BPD is recommended\
      \ to help \nreduce suicide risk, stabilize behavior, and help clients regulate\
      \ emotions (Ritter & Platt, 2016). SUD \ntreatment for people with BPD can be\
      \ complicated, and progress may be slow, but effective \ninterventions are available\
      \ to help reduce symptoms and improve functioning. A systematic review of 10\
      \ \nstudies on treatments for BPD and co-occurring SUDs found good support for\
      \ dialectical behavior \ntherapy, dynamic deconstructive therapy, and dual-focused\
      \ schema therapy in improving outcomes of"

      \ functioning, treatment utilization, and \ntreatment retention (Lee, Cameron,\
      \ & Jenner, 2015).  \nAdvice to the Counselor: Counseling a Client With BPD\
      \ \n• Anticipate that client progress will be slow and uneven.  \n• Assess the\
      \ risk of self-harm by asking about what is wrong, why now, whether the client\
      \ has specific plans for \nsuicide, past attempts, current feelings, and protective\
      \ factors. (See the discussion of suicidality at the end of \nthis chapter.)\
      \  \n• Maintain a positive but neutral professional relationship, avoid overinvolvement\
      \ in the client’s perceptions, \nand monitor the counseling process frequently\
      \ with supervisors and colleagues.  \n• Set clear boundaries and expectations\
      \ regarding limits and requirements in roles and behavior.  \n• Understand that\
      \ clients with BPD may be inconsistent in their attendance to sessions; anticipate\
      \ and discuss \nthese interruptions with the client. \n• Assist the client in\
      \ developing skills (e.g., deep breathing, meditation, cognitive restructuring)\
      \ to manage \nnegative memories and emotions.  \n• Help the client understand\
      \ the connections between their feelings and their behaviors. \n• Monitor newly\
      \ abstinent individuals with BPD for compulsive sexual behavior, compulsive\
      \ gambling, \ncompulsive spending/shopping, or other behaviors that result in\
      \ negative or even dangerous consequences. \n• Medication management and monitoring\
      \ should be included in the treatment plan. Individuals with BPD \noften are\
      \ skilled in seeking multiple sources of medication that they favor, such as\
      \ benzodiazepines. Once \nthey are prescribed this medication in a mental health\
      \ system, they may demand to be continued on the \nmedication to avoid dangerous\
      \ withdrawal. \n• Help clients manage their daily lives and responsibilities\
      \ by focusing on work, family, and social functioning. \n• At the beginning\
      \ of a crisis episode, a client with BPD may take a drink or use a different\
      \ substance in an \nattempt to quell the growing sense of tension or loss of\
      \ control. The client must learn that at this point, \nsubstance use increases\
      \ harm and real loss of control. The client needs to develop positive coping\
      \ strategies \nto put into play immediately upon experiencing a desire to use\
      \ substances.  \n• Educate clients about their SUDs and mental disorders. Clients\
      \ should learn that treatment for and recovery \nfrom their SUD may progress\
      \ at a different rate than their treatment for and recovery from BPD. In addition,\
      \ \nalthough many clients appear to fully recover from their SUDs, the degree\
      \ of long-term recovery from BPD is \nless understood and characterized.  \n\
      • Written and oral contracts that are simple, clear, direct, and time limited\
      \ can be a useful part of the \ntreatment plan. Contracts can help clients create\
      \ structure and safe environments for themselves, prevent \nrelapse, or promote\
      \ appropriate behavior in therapy sessions and in mutual support meetings. \n\
      • To treat people with BPD, pay attention to several areas, such as violence\
      \ to self or others, transference and \ncountertransference, boundaries, treatment\
      \ resistance, symptom substitution, and somatic complaints. \n• Therapists should\
      \ be realistic in their expectations and know that clients might try to test\
      \ them. To respond \nto such tests, therapists should maintain a matter-of-fact,\
      \ businesslike attitude, and remember that people \nwith PDs often display maladaptive\
      \ behaviors that have helped them to survive in difficult situations, \nsometimes\
      \ called “survivor behaviors.” (See TIP 36, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons\
      \ With Child Abuse \nand Neglect Issues [CSAT, 2000c]). \n \nCase Study: Counseling\
      \ an SUD Treatment Client With BPD \nMing L., an Asian woman, was 32 years old\
      \ when she was taken by ambulance to the local hospital’s emergency \ndepartment\
      \ (ED). Ming L. had taken 80 Tylenol capsules and an unknown amount of Ativan\
      \ in a suicide attempt. \nOnce medically stable, Ming L. was evaluated by the\
      \ hospital’s social worker to determine her clinical needs."

      Page 98 \nThe social worker asked Ming L. about her family of origin. Ming L.\
      \ gave a cold stare and said, “I don’t talk about \nthat.” Asked if she had\
      \ ever been sexually abused, Ming L. replied, “I don’t remember.” Ming L. acknowledged\
      \ \nprevious suicide attempts as well as a history of cutting her arm with a\
      \ razor blade during stressful episodes. \nShe reported that the cutting “helps\
      \ the pain.” \nMing L. denied having “a problem” with substances but admitted\
      \ taking “medication” and “drinking socially.” A \nreview of Ming L.’s medications\
      \ revealed the use of Ativan “when I need it.” It soon became clear that Ming\
      \ L. \nwas using a variety of benzodiazepines (antianxiety medications) prescribed\
      \ by several doctors and probably \nwas taking a daily dose indicative of severe\
      \ SUD. She reported using alcohol “on weekends with friends” but was \nvague\
      \ about the amount. Ming L. did acknowledge that before her suicide attempts,\
      \ she drank alone in her \napartment. This last suicide attempt was a response\
      \ to a breakup with her boyfriend.  \nThe counselor reads through notes from\
      \ an evaluating psychiatrist and reviews the social worker’s report of his \n\
      interview with Ming. She notes that the psychiatrist describes the client as\
      \ having a severe BPD, major recurrent \ndepression, and SUDs involving both\
      \ benzodiazepines and alcohol.  \nDiscussion: It is important to know the limits\
      \ of what an SUD treatment counselor or agency can and cannot do \nrealistically.\
      \ A client with problems this serious is unlikely to do well in standard SUD\
      \ treatment unless she also \nis enrolled in a program qualified to provide\
      \ treatment to clients with BPD, and preferably in a program that \noffers treatment\
      \ designed especially for this disorder, such as dialectical behavior therapy\
      \ (Linehan et al., 1999) \n(although SUD treatment programs are increasingly\
      \ developing their capacities to address specialized mental \ndisorders). She\
      \ is likely to need detoxification either on an inpatient basis or in a long-term\
      \ outpatient program \nthat knows how to address clients with PDs.  \nASPD \n\
      The core features of ASPD are a pervasive disregard for the rights, feelings,\
      \ and needs of others and a \nfailure to form long-term, fulfilling, adaptive\
      \ relationships (Exhibit 4.7). Individuals with ASPD often \ndisplay a host\
      \ of challenging traits: deceitfulness, remorselessness, aggression, disregard\
      \ for rules and \nlaws, low conscientiousness, impulsivity, failure to adhere\
      \ to social norms, delinquency, and \nrecklessness. As a result, these individuals\
      \ often lead unstable lives and are at high risk of increased \nmortality, violence/aggression,\
      \ suicide and suicidal behavior, accidents, criminality, incarceration, and\
      \ \nchronic illnesses (e.g., cancer, HIV) (Black, 2015; Black, 2017; Dykstra,\
      \ Schumacher, Mota & Coffey, 2015; \nKrasnova, Eaton, & Samuels, 2018; McCloskey\
      \ & Ammerman, 2018). Many people with ASPD have \nexperienced traumatic or disruptive\
      \ childhoods (Sher et al., 2015). \nExhibit 4.7. Diagnostic Criteria for ASPD\
      \ \nA. A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others,\
      \ occurring since age 15 years, as \nindicated by three (or more) of the following:\
      \  \n1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors,\
      \ as indicated by repeatedly performing \nacts that are grounds for arrest \
      \ \n2. Deceitfulness, indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning\

      \ Rights \nReserved. \nA particularly stigmatizing aspect of ASPD is its history\
      \ of being equated with derisive terms like \n“sociopath” and “psychopath.”\
      \ ASPD thus carries extremely negative connotations that might well be \naccurate\
      \ in only a small percentage of those people with the disorder. Psychopathy\
      \ and sociopathy are \npersonality traits, not mental disorders. They are related\
      \ to ASPD but are usually manifest in more \nextreme ways than ASPD (e.g., criminal\
      \ behavior). In short, psychopathy and sociopathy are not the \nsame as ASPD.\
      \ (See the TIP 44, Substance Abuse Treatment for Adults in the Criminal Justice\
      \ System \n[CSAT, 2005b] for a full discussion of psychopathy and its relationship\
      \ to ASPD.)  \nPrevalence  \nTwelve-month prevalence rates for DSM-IV ASPD fall\
      \ between 0.2 percent and 3.3 percent (APA, 2013). \nLifetime DSM-IV ASPD is\
      \ estimated at 3.6 percent (Hasin & Grant, 2015). Much higher prevalence rates\
      \ \n(up to 70 percent) have been found in studies of men in treatment for AUD\
      \ and SUD treatment clinics, \nprisons, and other forensic settings (APA, 2013).\
      \  \nMen are 2 to 8 times more likely to have an ASPD diagnosis than women (Black,\
      \ 2017). Lifetime prevalence \nof DSM-IV ASPD is estimated at 1.9 percent in\
      \ women and 5.5 percent in men (Hasin & Grant, 2015). \nASPD and SUDs \nPresence\
      \ of a 12-month or lifetime DSM-5 drug use disorder (i.e., an SUD excluding\
      \ alcohol) is linked \nwith 1.4 to 2 increased odds of having ASPD (Grant et\
      \ al., 2016). Prevalence of ASPD is 7 percent to 40 \npercent in men with existing\
      \ SUDs. ASPD is significantly associated with persistent SUDs (Grant et al.,\
      \ \n2015; Grant et al., 2016). \nAn analysis of NESARC data (and using DSM-IV\
      \ diagnoses) revealed gender differences in comorbidities \nwith ASPD (Alegria\
      \ et al., 2013). Men with ASPD were more likely to have AUD, any drug use disorder,\
      \ \nand narcissistic PD. Women with ASPD were more likely to have any mood disorder,\
      \ MDD, dysthymia, \nany anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobia, PTSD,\
      \ and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). \nWomen also were more likely to report\
      \ childhood adverse events, such as sexual abuse. Another study \nof treatment-seeking\
      \ individuals assessing gender differences in individuals with an ASPD diagnosis\
      \ \nsimilarly found that women with ASPD tended to be younger, had fewer episodes\
      \ of antisocial behavior \nand higher scores on measures of trauma, including\
      \ emotional and sexual abuse, than men with an \nASPD (Sher et al., 2015). Both\
      \ women and men with ASPD had comorbid alcohol (43.6 percent for \nwomen and\
      \ 50 percent for men) and cannabis use disorders (21.8 percent and 29.7 percent,\
      \ \nrespectively), and men had higher rates of comorbid cocaine use disorder\
      \ (22 percent) than women (7.3 \npercent). Many people with ASPD use substances\
      \ in a polydrug pattern involving alcohol, marijuana, \nheroin, cocaine, and\
      \ methamphetamine. \nPeople with ASPD and SUDs have higher rates of aggression,\
      \ impulsivity, and psychopathy than people \nwith SUDs alone (Alcorn et al.,\
      \ 2013). \nDisregard for others’ rights is a key diagnostic feature of ASPD.\
      \ Yet most clients who are actively using \nsubstances display behaviors at\
      \ some point that show such disregard, so perceiving the distinction between\
      \ \nSUD and ASPD can be difficult for the mental health and the SUD treatment\
      \ fields."

      Page 100 \nTreatment of ASPD and SUDs \nAs with most PDs, there are no empirically\
      \ supported treatments for ASPD, much less ASPD combined \nwith SUDs (Bateman\
      \ et al., 2015). Various therapies for ASPD with addiction (e.g., CBT, contingency\
      \ \nmanagement) may help ameliorate substance-related outcomes, like substance\
      \ misuse and number of \nurine-negative specimens over time, but studies are\
      \ few and sample sizes are small (Brazil, van Dongen, \nMaes, Mars, & Baskin-Sommers,\
      \ 2018).  \nAdvice to the Counselor: Counseling a Client With ASPD \n• As with\
      \ CODs in general, clients with ASPD and those with both an SUD and ASPD may\
      \ be seen as particularly \nhard to treat, having poor prognoses, and warranting\
      \ exclusion from treatment programs or group \ncounseling. Counselors should\
      \ maintain a realistic but hopeful, optimistic attitude toward helping clients\
      \ \nimprove symptoms and functioning. \n• Be aware of the stigma that surrounds\
      \ ASPD. Many mental health professionals have strongly negative \nfeelings about\
      \ working with clients who have ASPD, or any PD. Some may even refuse to accept\
      \ ASPD \nreferrals. Treating ASPD can be challenging, but people with ASPD have\
      \ the same rights to quality, ethical \ntreatment as anyone else with any other\
      \ mental disorder. \n• Empirical support for interventions to effectively manage\
      \ ASPD itself is lacking, but effective treatments exist \nto address certain\
      \ symptoms (e.g., risk of suicide or self-harm, affective instability), especially\
      \ those of co-\noccurring depression, anxiety, and SUDs. For instance, CBT can\
      \ be useful in restructuring negative thought \npatterns and reducing impulsivity,\
      \ improving interpersonal functioning, and providing general support. \n• Heed\
      \ the warning signs of countertransference and transference. Because many mental\
      \ health professionals \nhave negative attitudes or misperceptions about ASPD,\
      \ countertransference can occur and prevent \ncounselors from forming an empathic\
      \ and effective therapeutic alliance with the client. \n• Use a positive and\
      \ empathetic attitude but remain firm in enforcing the structure, rules, and\
      \ boundaries of \npsychotherapy and therapeutic relationship. \n• Differentiate\
      \ true ASPD from substance-related antisocial behavior. This can best be done\
      \ by looking at how \nthe person relates to others throughout the course of\
      \ his or her life. People with this disorder will have \nevidence of antisocial\
      \ behavior preceding substance use and even during periods of enforced abstinence.\
      \  \n• It also is important to recognize that people with substance-related\
      \ antisocial behavior may be more likely to \nhave MDD than other typical PDs.\
      \ However, the type and character of depression that may be experienced \nby\
      \ those with true ASPD have been less well characterized, and their treatment\
      \ is unclear. \nAnxiety Disorders  \nThe distinguishing feature of anxiety disorders\
      \ is excessive fear and worry along with behavioral \ndisturbances, usually\
      \ out of attempts to avoid or manage the anxiety. Anxiety disorders are highly\
      \ \ncomorbid with each other but differ in the types of situations that arouse\
      \ fear and the content of the \nanxiety-provoking thoughts and beliefs. Panic\
      \ attacks are a common fear response in anxiety disorders \nbut are not limited\
      \ to these disorders.  \nThree of the more prevalent anxiety disorders in the\
      \ adult population that are likely to co-occur with \naddiction are GAD, panic\
      \ disorder, and social anxiety disorder (SAD).  \nGAD \nGAD is marked by excessive\
      \ anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) about a range of topics or \n\
      events, like everyday living, finances, relationships, or work/school performance\
      \ (Exhibit 4.8). Anxiety is \nintense, frequent, chronic (i.e., lasting at least\
      \ 6 months), and disproportionate to the actual threat \nposed by the subject\
      \ of worry. The worry is accompanied by additional cognitive/physical symptoms."

      \ disorder is diagnosed in people who experience repeated panic attacks that\
      \ are distressing and \ndisabling (Exhibit 4.9). A panic attack is an abrupt\
      \ but very intense occurrence of extreme fear. It often \nonly lasts for a few\
      \ minutes but the symptoms can be extremely uncomfortable and upsetting, such\
      \ as \nhyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, sweating, dizziness, hot flashes\
      \ or chills, numbness or tingling, \nand the sensation or fear of nausea or\
      \ choking. People experiencing panic attacks also can experience \npsychological\
      \ symptoms, like feeling as though they are going to die, as though they are\
      \ “losing their \nmind,” as though things are not real (derealization), or as\
      \ if they have left their body \n(depersonalization). Because of the distressing\
      \ nature of panic attacks, people with panic disorder may \nconstantly worry\
      \ about having subsequent attacks or engage in behaviors in an attempt to control\
      \ the \nattacks (like avoiding places where they have previously had a panic\
      \ attack or fear they might have one). \nExhibit 4.9. Diagnostic Criteria for\

      \ an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort \nthat reaches a peak\

      \ APA. All Rights \nReserved. \nPanic disorder often is underdiagnosed at the\
      \ beginning of treatment or else is seen as secondary to the \nmore significant\
      \ disorders, which are the primary focus of treatment. However, panic disorder\
      \ can \nsignificantly impede a person’s ability to take certain steps toward\
      \ recovery, such as getting on a bus to \ngo to a meeting or sitting in a 12­Step\
      \ meeting. Sometimes counselors can erroneously identify these \nbehaviors as\
      \ manipulative or treatment-resistant behaviors. \nAgoraphobia \nOne of the\
      \ changes in DSM-5 concerns the separation of agoraphobia from panic disorder.\
      \ Although \nnow two distinct conditions, they are closely related and many\
      \ of their symptoms overlap. In \nagoraphobia, people exhibit a strong fear\
      \ of being in certain places or situations where escape could be \ndifficult\
      \ should the person experience panic-like symptoms or otherwise feel anxious\
      \ or a loss of control. \nSituations typically include being in crowds, on public\
      \ transportation, in open spaces (like bridges), in \nclosed spaces (such as\
      \ the movie theater), or away from home. People with agoraphobia avoid these\
      \ \nsituations for fear of having panic attacks or similar incapacitating or\
      \ embarrassing symptoms (e.g., \nvomiting, incontinence), or they tolerate them\
      \ but with great distress and discomfort.  \nAgoraphobia often occurs without\
      \ panic disorder in community settings but frequently occurs with \npanic disorder\
      \ in clinical settings; the two conditions are distinct yet intertwined (APA,\
      \ 2013; \nAsmundson, Taylor, & Smits, 2014). SUDs can and do co-occur with agoraphobia\
      \ (Goodwin & Stein, \n2013; Marmorstein, 2012), but literature on this co-occurrence\
      \ is relatively small compared with other"

      \ (Cougle, Hakes, Macatee, \nChavarria, & Zvolensky, 2015) rather than occurring\
      \ alone. Furthermore, research is more focused on its \nco-occurrence with nicotine\
      \ than other substances. \nThe linkage of agoraphobia with addiction may be\
      \ explained by its relationship with panic disorder and \nnot with SUD. Thus,\
      \ agoraphobia is not a subject of focus for this chapter but is mentioned here\
      \ because \nof its interrelationship with panic disorder, which addiction counselors\
      \ are likely to see in their clients. \nSAD \nSocial phobia describes the persistent\
      \ and recognizably irrational fear of embarrassment and humiliation \nin social\
      \ situations (Exhibit 4.10). The social phobia may be quite specific (e.g.,\
      \ public speaking) or may \nbecome generalized to all social situations. SAD,\
      \ also called social phobia in DSM-5, involves intense \nanxiety or fear in\
      \ social or performance situations. Individuals may fear being judged by others\
      \ (e.g., \nbeing perceived as stupid, awkward, or boring); being embarrassed\
      \ or humiliated; accidentally offending \nsomeone; or being the center of attention.\
      \ As a result, the individual will often avoid social or \nperformance situations;\
      \ when a situation cannot be avoided, they experience significant anxiety and\
      \ \ndistress. Many people with SAD have strong physical symptoms (e.g., rapid\
      \ heart rate, nausea, sweating) \nand may experience full-blown attacks when\
      \ confronting a feared situation. They recognize that their \nfear is excessive\
      \ and unreasonable, but people with SAD often feel powerless against their anxiety.\
      \ \nExhibit 4.10. Diagnostic Criteria for SAD \nA. Marked fear or anxiety about\
      \ one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible\
      \ \nscrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a\
      \ conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), \nbeing observed (e.g., eating or\
      \ drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). \nNote:\
      \ In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions\
      \ with adults. \nB. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or\
      \ show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively \nevaluated (i.e., will be humiliating\
      \ or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). \nC. The social\
      \ situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. \nNote: In children, the\
      \ fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging,\
      \ shrinking, or \nfailing to speak in social situations. \nD. The social situations\
      \ are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. \nE. The fear or anxiety\
      \ is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and\
      \ to the \nsociocultural context.  \nF. The fear, anxiety or avoidance is persistent,\
      \ typically lasting for 6 months or more.  \nG. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance\
      \ causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,\
      \ or \nother important areas of functioning. \nH. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance\
      \ is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug\
      \ of \nabuse, a medication) or another medical condition.  \nI. The fear, anxiety,\
      \ or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder,\
      \ such as \npanic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.\
      \  \nJ. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, obesity, disfigurement\
      \ from burns or injury) is present, \nthe fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly\
      \ unrelated or is excessive. \nSpecify if:  \n• Performance only: If the fear\
      \ is restricted to speaking or performing in public \nSource: APA (2013, pp.\

      Page 104 \nPrevalence \nThe lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder is estimated\
      \ at over 30 percent; 12-month prevalence \nestimates are approximately 19 percent\
      \ (Harvard Medical School, 2005). A recent World Health \nOrganization (WHO)\
      \ survey and analysis using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria found the community lifetime\
      \ \nprevalence of GAD in the U.S. is 7.8 percent, and 12-month prevalence is\
      \ 4 percent (Ruscio et al., 2017). \nWomen are twice as likely as men to experience\
      \ the disorder (APA, 2013). Lifetime prevalence of panic \nattacks (ascertained\
      \ as part of an analysis of data collected worldwide and defined per DSM-5 criteria)\
      \ \nwith or without panic disorder is almost 28 percent (de Jonge et al., 2016).\
      \ The 12-month prevalence in \nthe general population for panic disorder is\
      \ about 2.4 percent; lifetime prevalence is 6.8 percent \n(Kessler, Petukhova,\
      \ Sampson, Zaslavsky, & Wittchen, 2012). The 12-month prevalence for SAD is\
      \ \napproximately 7 percent; rates in the community trend higher in women (1.5\
      \ times) than men, \nespecially in young adults (APA, 2013).  \nAnxiety Disorders\
      \ and SUDs \nThe relationship between substance use and anxiety disorders is\
      \ complex and multifaceted, and the two \ndisorders commonly co-occur. Presence\
      \ of a 12-month or lifetime DSM-5 drug use disorder (i.e., an SUD \nexcluding\
      \ alcohol) is associated with a 1.2 to 1.3 increased odds of having any anxiety\
      \ disorder, a 1.0 to \n1.3 increased odds of having panic disorder, a 1.2 to\
      \ 1.3 increased odds of having GAD, and a 1.1 to 1.3 \nincreased odds of having\
      \ SAD (Grant et al., 2016). Recent analyses indicate lifetime (but not 12-month)\
      \ \ndiagnosis of drug and alcohol use disorders is associated with GAD (Grant\
      \ et al., 2015; Grant et al., \n2016). Twelve-month prevalence of panic disorder\
      \ with co-occurring SUD is 11 percent, and lifetime co-\noccurrence is 28 percent\
      \ (de Jonge et al., 2016).  \nWhen anxiety and SUDs co-occur, the disorders\
      \ affect development and maintenance of comorbidity, \nand each disorder modifies\
      \ the presentation and treatment outcomes for the other (Brady, Haynes, \nHartwell,\
      \ & Killeen, 2013). Consequently, people with anxiety disorders and co-occurring\
      \ SUDs \nexperience worse outcomes than those with either disorder alone, including\
      \ greater disability, more \nhospitalizations and healthcare utilization, poorer\
      \ functioning, more difficulties in interpersonal \nrelationships, more severe\
      \ symptoms, worse health-related quality of life, and poorer treatment \nresponse\
      \ (Buckner, Heimberg, Ecker, & Vinci, 2013; Magidson, Liu, Lejuez, & Blanco,\
      \ 2012). GAD and \naddiction are associated with higher rates of heavy alcohol\
      \ use, hospitalizations, relapse, and leaving \ntreatment against medical advice\
      \ compared with people with SUDs but no GAD (Domenico, Lewis, \nHazarika, &\
      \ Nixon, 2018).  \nAnxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are predictors of\
      \ suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (Bentley \net al., 2016); given that\
      \ SUDs also elevate risk of suicide (Yuodelis-Flores & Ries, 2015), the combination\
      \ \nof the two suggests the use of suicide risk mitigation efforts is warranted\
      \ with these clients. \nTreatment of Anxiety Disorders and SUDs \nSUD treatment\
      \ for people with anxiety should include interventions that address the anxiety\
      \ as well as \nthe addiction. Clients may report a reduction in some anxiety\
      \ symptoms during detoxification or early in \nrecovery (McHugh, 2015). That\
      \ said, SUD treatment alone is not sufficient to address the co-occurring \n\
      anxiety. Further, the presence of an anxiety disorder complicates SUD treatment\
      \ and can make \nachieving and sustaining abstinence and preventing relapse\
      \ more problematic (McHugh, 2015). \nConcurrent, integrated treatments that\
      \ include CBT or exposure therapy can safely, effectively reduce \npsychiatric\
      \ and SUD symptoms but in some studies are no more effective than placebo (McHugh,\
      \ 2015)."

      Page 105 \nAdvice to the Counselor: Counseling a Client With an Anxiety Disorder\
      \ \n• Treating only one disorder is usually insufficient, as is treating disorders\
      \ in isolation (e.g., sequentially). \nClients with both anxiety and addictions\
      \ need concurrent treatment that equally targets both conditions. \n• Pharmacotherapies\
      \ can effectively reduce anxiety symptoms (especially if combined with psychotherapy)\
      \ \nand may need to be a part of clients’ treatment plans. But prescribing psychotropic\
      \ medication in someone \nwith an SUD can be tricky. As needed, refer the client\
      \ to a mental health professional for a full assessment to \ndetermine whether\
      \ medication is warranted and how to safely integrate it into the treatment\
      \ plan.  \n• People in recovery from SUDs may have conflicting feelings about\
      \ taking medication. Not all clients with \nanxiety disorders will need pharmacotherapy,\
      \ but in many cases it can help and, when combined with \npsychotherapy, is\
      \ frequently more effective at reducing anxiety symptoms and improving functioning\
      \ than \neither medication or psychotherapy alone. That said, do not “push”\
      \ medications on clients; instead, invite \nthem to explore their feelings about\
      \ taking medications and discuss advantages and disadvantages of such. \n• Selective\
      \ serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly used to help manage GAD, panic\
      \ disorder, and SAD but \nshould not be taken with alcohol. It is vital that\
      \ addiction counselors educate clients taking anxiolytics \n(especially benzodiazepines)\
      \ about the indications, contraindications, adverse effects, and dangers of\
      \ \nmedication–alcohol interactions. For clients with anxiety and AUD specifically,\
      \ referral to a mental health \nprofessional to discuss medication management\
      \ may be needed. \n• Be mindful of the increased risk of dependence and abuse\
      \ liability with benzodiazepines. This risk might be \nheightened in people\
      \ who misuse substances to self-medicate their anxiety symptoms or in people\
      \ with \nSUDs in general. Use CBT known to effectively treat anxiety disorders\
      \ to minimize or augment the use of \nmedications.  \n• Educate clients on the\
      \ dangers of using substances to self-medicate and control anxiety symptoms,\
      \ and make \ndistress tolerance, self-regulation, and adaptive coping skills\
      \ major focuses of treatment. \n• Assess for (and advise against) over-the-counter\
      \ substances that can cause or exacerbate anxiety symptoms, \nlike caffeine\
      \ pills and weight loss supplements. \n• Understand the special sensitivities\
      \ of clients with SAD to social situations. Although group CBT can help \npeople\
      \ with SAD learn to become more comfortable in social environments, individual\
      \ CBT can be equally \neffective and should be an option for clients who decline\
      \ group treatment. \n• When clients do not improve as expected, it is not necessarily\
      \ because of treatment failure or client \nnoncompliance. Clients may be compliant\
      \ and plans may be adequate, but disease processes remain resistant.  \n• Expect\
      \ a longer treatment duration compared with treatment for either anxiety or\
      \ addiction alone. \n• Clients with severe and persistent SUDs and anxiety disorders\
      \ should not be seen as resistant, manipulative, \nor unmotivated but in need\
      \ of intensive support. \n• Symptoms may result from SUDs, not underlying mental\
      \ disorders; careful, continual assessment is key. \n• Anxiety symptoms and\
      \ disorders are risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Use\
      \ suicide risk mitigation \n(e.g., routine assessment, thorough documentation)\
      \ and collaborate with clients to implement safety plans. \n \nCase Study: GAD\
      \ and Protracted Withdrawal \nRay Y., a 50-year-old husband and father of teenagers,\
      \ is going through protracted alcohol withdrawal. He \nappears “edgy” and irritable,\
      \ sometimes sad, and complains to his SUD treatment counselor of insomnia, \n\
      headaches, and an upset stomach. He tells the counselor he can barely stand\
      \ not to drink: “I’m jumping out of \nmy skin.” Although these symptoms are\
      \ common during protracted withdrawal, because they have persisted for \nover\
      \ a month, the counselor begins a more detailed exploration.  \nThe counselor\
      \ asks Ray Y. whether he had these symptoms before he used alcohol, and Ray\
      \ Y. says he’s “always \nbeen this way.” He worries about everything, even events\
      \ that are weeks away. His family vacations are \nnightmares because every aspect\
      \ of vacation planning troubles him and keeps him awake. During family \ntherapy,\
      \ it becomes apparent that his daughter deeply resents his controlling and distrustful\
      \ behavior, as well as \nhis overprotective stance toward all her social commitments.\
      \ The counselor refers Ray Y. to a psychiatrist, who"

      \ health counseling. The family receives help \ncoping with Ray Y.’s disorder,\
      \ and his daughter is referred for short-term counseling to help her address\
      \ the \nmental problems she is beginning to develop as a result of her father’s\
      \ excessive control.  \nDiscussion: Anxiety symptoms are quite common during\
      \ protracted withdrawal, but counselors should consider \nthe possibility that\
      \ an anxiety disorder is indicated. Symptoms should be tracked to see whether\
      \ they persist \nbeyond the normal time that might be expected for protracted\
      \ withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal can occur up \nto a few months to a year,\
      \ particularly with antianxiety medication. It varies according to severity,\
      \ duration, and \ntype of medication. Most protracted withdrawal is between\
      \ 1 and 3 months. Counselors should also be aware \nof the effect of such disorders\
      \ on close family members. Children and adolescents may not understand that\
      \ a \nparent has a mental disorder and may be relieved to have a way of understanding\
      \ and coping with difficult \nbehavior. \nSchizophrenia and Other Psychotic\
      \ Disorders \nPsychotic Disorders \nPsychotic disorders are characterized by\
      \ a severely incapacitated mental and emotional state involving \na person’s\
      \ thinking, perception, and emotional control. Key features include distorted\
      \ thoughts in which \nan individual has false beliefs, sensations, or perceptions\
      \ that are imagined, are very extreme, or both; \nand unusual emotional and\
      \ behavioral states with deterioration in thinking, judgment, self-control,\
      \ or \nunderstanding. Psychotic disorders are usually expressed clinically as\
      \ a combination of: \n• \nDelusions: Beliefs that are fixed, resistant to change,\
      \ and are directly contradicted by evidence or \notherwise not grounded in reality\
      \ (e.g., the belief that one is being followed by people from Mars, or \nthat\
      \ one is a very important person to whom the President wants to speak right\
      \ away). \n• \nHallucinations: Hearing, seeing, tasting, or feeling things that\
      \ are not there and being unable to \nrecognize that what is being experienced\
      \ is not real (such as hearing voices that say self-condemning \nor other disturbing\
      \ things, or seeing a person who isn’t really there). \n• \nDisorganized thinking:\
      \ This is reflected in speech that is incoherent (“word salad”), illogical,\
      \ uses \nunconventional or made-up words (neologisms and word approximations),\
      \ fluctuates from topic to \ntopic (loose associations), or is completely unrelated\
      \ to subject matter at hand (tangential speech).  \n• \nGrossly disorganized\
      \ or abnormal motor behavior: This includes a wide range of odd behaviors, \n\
      such as laughing or smiling inappropriately, grimacing, staring, talking to\
      \ oneself, purposeless or \npeculiar movements and mannerisms, mimicking others’\
      \ speech or movements (echolalia and \nechopraxia), and random agitation. A\
      \ specific psychomotor disturbance called catatonia—which \nincludes immobility,\
      \ stupor, and holding rigid body positions against gravity over extended periods\
      \ \nof time (catalepsy)—can occur in schizophrenia but is also present in other\
      \ mental disorders (like \nbipolar disorder) and some medical conditions. \n\
      • \nNegative symptoms: A constellation of symptoms reflecting diminished emotional\
      \ expression and \nself-motivated purposeful activities (avolition). Negative\
      \ symptoms also may include diminished \nspeech output (alogia) or poverty of\
      \ speech (e.g., one-word answers), motivation, ability to \nexperience pleasure\
      \ (anhedonia), or interest in social activities (asociality). \nAlthough schizophrenia\
      \ is perhaps the most well-known psychotic disorder, people with bipolar \n\
      disorders may experience psychotic states during periods of mania—the heightened\
      \ state of \nexcitement, little or no sleep, impulsiveness, and poor judgment\
      \ (see the section “Bipolar I Disorder”). \nOther conditions also can be accompanied\
      \ by a psychotic state, including toxic poisoning, other"

      \ other mental disorders (MDD, dementia, \nPTSD, alcohol withdrawal states,\
      \ brief reactive psychoses, and others). \nSUD treatment counselors typically\
      \ do not see clients in the throes of an acute psychotic episode, as \nsuch\
      \ psychotic patients more likely present, or are referred to, EDs and mental\
      \ health services facilities. \nCounselors are more likely to encounter such\
      \ clients in a “residual” or later and less active phase of the \nillness, the\
      \ time at which these individuals may receive treatment for their SUDs in an\
      \ SUD treatment \nagency. Even if the SUD treatment counselor never sees a client\
      \ during an actively psychotic period, \nknowing what the client experiences\
      \ as a psychotic episode will enable the counselor to understand and \nassist\
      \ the client more effectively. On the other hand, counselors are increasingly\
      \ treating clients with \nmethamphetamine dependence who often have residual\
      \ paranoid and psychotic symptoms and may \nneed antipsychotic medications.\
      \  \nSchizophrenia \nNo single symptom specifically indicates or characterizes\
      \ schizophrenia. Symptoms include a range of \ncognitive, behavioral, and emotional\
      \ dysfunctions (Exhibit 4.11). Thus, schizophrenia is a heterogeneous \nclinical\
      \ syndrome. Symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized\
      \ speech \n(e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence), grossly disorganized\
      \ or catatonic behavior, and deficits in \ncertain areas of functioning—for\
      \ example, the inability to initiate and persist in goal­directed activities.\
      \ \nThese symptoms regularly develop before the first episode of a schizophrenic\
      \ breakdown, sometimes \nstretching back years and often intensifying prior\
      \ to reactivations of an active, acutely psychotic state. \nExhibit 4.11. Diagnostic\
      \ Criteria for Schizophrenia \nA. Two (or more) of the following, each present\
      \ for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less \nif successfully\
      \ treated). At least one of these must be 1, 2, or 3: \n1. Delusions  \n2. Hallucinations\
      \  \n3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence)  \n4.\
      \ Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior  \n5. Negative symptoms, (i.e.,\
      \ diminished emotional expression or avolition) \nB. For a significant portion\
      \ of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one\
      \ or more \nmajor areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care,\
      \ is markedly below the level achieved prior to the \nonset (or when the onset\
      \ is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level\
      \ of \ninterpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).  \nC. Continuous\
      \ signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period\
      \ must include at least 1 \nmonth of symptoms (or less if successfully treated)\
      \ that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may \ninclude periods\
      \ of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods,\
      \ the signs of the \ndisturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms\
      \ or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A \npresent in an attenuated\
      \ form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).  \nD. Schizoaffective\
      \ disorder and depressive or bipolar with psychotic features have been ruled\

      \ 15 leading causes of global \ndisability (GBD 2016 Disease and Injury Incidence\
      \ and Prevalence Collaborators, 2017). \nSchizophrenia/Other Psychotic Disorders\
      \ and SUDs \nSubstance misuse often occurs in people with schizophrenia and\
      \ other psychotic disorders. In a study of \nmore than 1,200 people with schizophrenia\
      \ (Kerner, 2015), lifetime SUD prevalence was 55 percent, \nincluding alcohol\
      \ abuse at 17 percent, alcohol dependence at 26 percent, illicit drug abuse\
      \ at 13 percent, \nand illicit drug dependence at 14 percent. The most commonly\
      \ used substances were alcohol (43 \npercent), cannabis (35 percent), and other\
      \ illegal substances (27 percent). Compared with the general \npopulation, people\
      \ with severe psychotic disorders have 4 times greater risk of heavy alcohol\
      \ use, 3.5 \ntimes the risk of heavy cannabis use, and 4.6 times the risk of\
      \ recreational drug use (Hartz et al., 2014).  \nIndividuals with SMI (including\
      \ schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychotic\
      \ \nfeatures) die approximately 10 to 25 years earlier than the general population,\
      \ mostly because of the effects of \nphysical illnesses caused at least in part\
      \ by SUDs (e.g., heart disease, lung disease, infectious disease) (Hartz et\
      \ \nal., 2014; WHO, n.d.). \nThe combination of substance misuse in people with\
      \ schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders \ncontributes to shortened mortality\
      \ and an increased likelihood of deleterious health and functional \noutcomes,\
      \ including a higher risk for self-destructive and violent behaviors, victimization,\
      \ suicide, \nhousing instability, poor physical health, cognitive impairment,\
      \ employment problems, legal difficulties, \nand unstable social relationships\
      \ (Bennett, Bradshaw, & Catalano, 2017; Trudeau et al., 2018). Further, \nsubstance\
      \ misuse in schizophrenia can worsen disease course and may reduce adherence\
      \ to \nantipsychotic medication (Werner & Covenas, 2017).  \nTreatment of Schizophrenia/Other\
      \ Psychotic Disorders and SUDs \nAntipsychotic medication is the standard of\
      \ care for reducing positive symptoms (e.g., delusions, \nhallucinations) whereas\
      \ various psychosocial interventions and approaches can help address addiction\
      \ \nrecovery. Specifically, integrated CBT, group behavioral therapy, contingency\
      \ management, 12-Step \nfacilitation, motivational enhancement, motivational\
      \ interviewing, assertive community treatment, or \n(preferably) a combination\
      \ thereof may all help reduce substance use (quantity, frequency, and \nseverity),\
      \ increase abstinence, reduce number of drinking days, lower relapse rates,\
      \ reduce the number \nof positive urine samples, and decrease negative consequences\
      \ of substance use in people with SUDs \nand schizophrenia or other SMI (including\
      \ psychotic disorders) (Bennett et al., 2017; De Witte, Crunelle, \nSabbe, Moggi,\
      \ & Dom, 2014). These approaches have also been associated with improvements\
      \ in \npsychiatric symptoms (including negative symptoms), scores of global\
      \ functioning, hospitalizations, and \nachieving stable housing (De Witte et\
      \ al., 2014). Integrated treatments appear to yield more positive \nresults\
      \ than single interventions and are the recommended approach (De Witte et al.,\
      \ 2014). \nCase Study: Counseling an SUD Treatment Client With Schizophrenia\
      \ \nAdolfo M. is a 40-year-old Latino man who began using cannabis and alcohol\
      \ at 15. He was diagnosed as having \nschizophrenia when he was 18 and began\
      \ using cocaine at 19. Sometimes, he lives with his sister or with \ntemporary\
      \ girlfriends; sometimes, on the street. He has never had a sustained relationship,\
      \ and he has never \nheld a steady job. He has few close friends. He has had\
      \ periods of abstinence and freedom from hallucinations \nand major delusions,\
      \ but he generally has unusual views of the world that emerge quickly in conversation.\
      \ \nAdolfo M. has been referred to an SUD treatment counselor, who was hired\
      \ by the mental health center to do \nmost of the group and individual drug/alcohol\

      Page 110 \nwith Adolfo M. and his case manager together. This provides a clinical\
      \ linkage as well as a way to get the best \nhistory. The clinical history reveals\
      \ that Adolfo M. does best when he is sober and on medications, but there are\
      \ \ntimes when he will be sober and not adhere to a medical regimen, or when\
      \ he is both taking medications and \ndrinking (although these periods are becoming\
      \ shorter in duration and less frequent). His case manager often is \nable to\
      \ redirect him toward renewed sobriety and adherence to medications, but Adolfo\
      \ M. and the case \nmanager agree that the cycle of relapse and the work of\
      \ pulling things back together is wearing them both out. \nAfter the meeting,\
      \ the case manager, counselor, and Adolfo M. agree to meet weekly for a while\
      \ to see what \nthey can do together to increase the stable periods and decrease\
      \ the relapse periods. After a month of these \nplanning meetings, the following\
      \ plan emerges. Adolfo M. will attend SUD treatment groups for people with \n\
      CODs (run by the counselor three times a week at the clinic), see the team psychiatrist,\
      \ and attend local dual \ndisorder AA meetings. The SUD treatment group he will\
      \ be joining is one that addresses not only addiction \nproblems but also difficulties\
      \ with treatment follow-through, life problems, ways of dealing with stress,\
      \ and the \nneed for social support for clients trying to get sober. When and\
      \ if relapse happens, Adolfo M. will be accepted \nback without prejudice and\
      \ supported in recovery and treatment of both his substance misuse and mental\
      \ \ndisorders; however, part of the plan is to analyze relapses with the group.\
      \ His goal is to have as many sober days \nas possible with as many days adhering\
      \ to a medical regimen as possible. Another aspect of the group is that \nmonthly,\
      \ 90-day, 6-month, and yearly sobriety birthdays are celebrated. Part of the\
      \ employment program at the \ncenter is that clients need to have a minimum\
      \ of 3 months of sobriety before they will be placed in a supported \nwork situation,\
      \ so this becomes an incentive for sobriety as well. \nDiscussion: SUD treatment\
      \ counselors working within mental health centers should be aware of the need\
      \ not \nonly to work with the client but also to form solid working relationships\
      \ with case managers, the psychiatrist, \nand other personnel. Seeing clients\
      \ with case managers and other team members is a good way to establish \nimportant\
      \ linkages and a united view of the treatment plan. In Adolfo M.’s case, the\
      \ counselor used his ties with \nthe case manager to good effect and also is\
      \ using relapse prevention and contingency management strategies \nappropriately\
      \ (see Chapter 5 for a discussion of relapse prevention). \n \nAdvice to the\
      \ Counselor: Counseling a Client With Schizophrenia or Other Psychotic \nDisorders\
      \ \n• What looks like resistance or denial may in reality be a manifestation\
      \ of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. \n• Use a recovery perspective and\
      \ a compassionate attitude toward clients. This can convey hope and allow \n\
      clients to envision significant recovery and improvement in their lives.  \n\
      • Obtain a working knowledge of the signs and symptoms of the disorder.  \n\
      • An accurate understanding of the role of SUDs in the client’s psychotic disorder\
      \ requires a multiple-contact, \nlongitudinal assessment. \n• Work closely with\
      \ a psychiatrist or mental health professional.  \n• Expect crises associated\
      \ with the mental disorder and have available resources (i.e., crisis intervention,\
      \ \npsychiatric consultation) to facilitate stabilization.  \n• Assist the client\
      \ to obtain Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, disability\
      \ payments, \nand other social services.  \n• Make available psychoeducation\
      \ on the psychiatric condition and use of medication. The psychoeducational\
      \ \ncomponent of treatment should include information about mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs, from causes and the \nnatural histories of the disorders to the\
      \ recovery process and how the illnesses can interact. \n• Medication adherence\
      \ is critical to control positive symptoms and maintain stability/functionality.\
      \ Yet \nnonadherence is common. Make medication monitoring and adherence a part\
      \ of treatment by:  \n− Providing psychoeducation about its importance. \n−\
      \ Checking in with clients about the status of their symptoms (given that nonresponsiveness\
      \ to medication \nmay be a reason for nonadherence)."

      \ mental illness and substance use.  \n• Consider including family members and\
      \ community supports, when appropriate, in overall treatment.  \n• Involve family\
      \ in psychoeducational groups that specifically focus on education about SUDs\
      \ and psychotic \ndisorders; establish support groups of families and significant\
      \ others.  \n• Psychotic disorders and SUDs tend to be chronic disorders with\
      \ multiple relapses and remissions, requiring \nlong-term treatment. For clients\
      \ with CODs involving psychotic disorders, a long-term approach is \nimperative.\
      \ \n• Monitor clients for signs of substance misuse relapse and a return of\
      \ psychotic symptoms.  \n• Suicide is a significant risk in schizophrenia, more\
      \ so when co-occurring with SUDs. Ongoing monitoring/ \nassessment of suicidal\

      \ \nAlthough ADHD is frequently associated with children, the disorder can persist\
      \ into adulthood and for \nsome individuals can begin in adulthood. In adults,\
      \ symptoms can include having a short temper, \ndifficulty being productive\
      \ at work, and an inability to sustain relationships. \nThe three types of ADHD\
      \ are combined type (person has difficulty paying attention and hyperactivity);\
      \ \npredominantly inattentive; and predominantly hyperactive­impulsive.  \n\
      Prevalence \nAt the time of this publication, 12-month and lifetime ADHD prevalence\
      \ rates in the general population \nusing DSM-5 criteria are unreported. However,\
      \ McKeown et al. (2015) examined estimated DSM-5 and \nDSM-IV ADHD prevalence\
      \ among more than 16,000 school-aged children (ages 4 to 13 years) in two \n\
      states and found 11.3 percent would meet DSM-5 criteria and 8.9 percent would\
      \ meet DSM-IV criteria. \nThe prevalence of ADHD in adults is less studied than\
      \ in children. The overall current prevalence of adult \nADHD (using DSM-IV\
      \ criteria) is around 2.5 percent (APA, 2013; Simon, Czobor, Balint, Meszaros,\
      \ & \nBitter, 2009). The most recent epidemiological population-based survey\
      \ data on U.S. adults with ADHD \n(Kessler et al., 2005) suggests the estimated\
      \ lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV ADHD in people ages 18 to 44 \nyears is 8.1\
      \ percent.  \nADHD and SUDs \nSUDs are among the most common comorbidities of\
      \ ADHD (Katzman, Bilkey, Chokka, Fallu, & Klassen, \n2017), and data from clinical\
      \ and epidemiological studies support this linkage (Martinez-Raga, Szerman,\
      \ \nKnecht, & de Alvaro, 2013). Among adults with substance misuse, the prevalence\
      \ of ADHD is \napproximately 23 percent, although this estimate is dependent\
      \ on substance of misuse and assessment"

      \ a sample of more than 500 \nchildren with and without ADHD who were followed\
      \ throughout adolescence and early adulthood \n(Molina et al., 2018), early\
      \ substance use in adolescence was greater and escalated more quickly in the\
      \ \nchildren with ADHD. Further, weekly and daily cannabis use and daily smoking\
      \ in adulthood were \nsignificantly more prevalent in the ADHD group than the\
      \ non-ADHD group. Adults with ADHD have been \nfound primarily to use alcohol,\
      \ nicotine, cannabis, and cocaine (Lee, Humphreys, Flory, Liu, & Glass, \n2011;\
      \ Luo & Levin, 2017). \nPeople with addiction who have co-occurring ADHD have\
      \ a heightened risk for suicide attempts, \nhospitalizations, earlier onset\
      \ of addiction, impulsivity, more severe disease course (for both ADHD and \n\
      the SUD) and polysubstance use as well as lower rates of abstinence and treatment\
      \ adherence (Egan, \nDawson, & Wymbs, 2017; Katzman et al., 2017). ADHD and\
      \ SUDs carry an enhanced risk of comorbidity \nwith depression, conduct disorder,\
      \ bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, and PDs (Luo & Levin, 2017; \nMartinez-Raga\
      \ et al., 2013; Regnart, Truter, & Meyer, 2017; Young & Sedgwick, 2015; Zulauf,\
      \ Sprich, \nSafren, & Wilens, 2014). Symptoms of ADHD hyperactivity and impulsivity\
      \ are more strongly seen with \nsubstance misuse and SUDs than ADHD symptoms\
      \ of inattention (De Alwis, Lynskey, Reiersen, & \nAgrawal, 2014). \nAlthough\
      \ it is important to rule out other causes of inattention or hyperactivity,\
      \ including substance \nmisuse, misattribution of ADHD symptoms to SUDs increases\
      \ the likelihood of underdiagnosis \n(Crunelle et al., 2018). People with SUDs\
      \ who are newly abstinent or those in active or protracted \nwithdrawal may\
      \ experience some impairments similar to ADHD. Many of the behavioral symptoms\
      \ of \nADHD also appear during substance intoxication and withdrawal, and functional\
      \ consequences of ADHD, \nsuch as poor job performance or job loss, are also\
      \ evident in people with addiction. Both alcohol and \ncannabis can produce\
      \ symptoms that mimic ADHD. This underscores the importance of conducting a\
      \ \nthorough assessment (see Chapter 3) to fully investigate symptoms in childhood,\
      \ family history of \naddiction and psychiatric illness, and other biopsychosocial\
      \ factors that can inform whether a diagnosis \nof ADHD, SUD, or both are warranted.\
      \ \nTreatment of ADHD and SUDs \nADHD complicates SUD treatment because clients\
      \ with these CODs may have more difficulty engaging in \ntreatment and learning\
      \ abstinence skills, be at greater risk for relapse, and have poorer substance\
      \ use \noutcomes. The most common attention problems in SUD treatment populations\
      \ are secondary to short-\nterm toxic effects of substances, and these should\
      \ be substantially better with each month of sobriety. \nA consensus statement\
      \ by an international panel of ADHD and addiction experts (including from the\
      \ U.S.) on the \ntreatment of ADHD and SUDs recommends (Crunelle et al., 2018):\
      \ \n• Using a combined treatment approach comprising psychoeducation, pharmacotherapy,\
      \ individual or group \nCBT, and peer support. \n• Integrating ADHD treatment\
      \ into SUD treatment; integrating SUD treatment into mental health services.\
      \ \n• Treating both disorders, but addressing the SUD first and then the ADHD\
      \ shortly afterwards. \n• Considering residential treatment for cases of severe\
      \ addiction. \n• Providing pharmacotherapy for ADHD (particularly with psychotherapy),\
      \ but clinicians should be aware that \nmedication alone is usually not sufficient\
      \ to treat the SUD. \n• Prescribing ADHD medication as needed but understand\
      \ that this is a controversial topic because of the \nmisuse liability of stimulants.\
      \ Clinicians should consider all risks and weigh them against potential benefits\
      \ \nwhen deciding whether or not to prescribe stimulant medications for people\
      \ with ADHD-SUD."

      Page 115 \nThere are limited studies exploring treatment of ADHD with comorbid\
      \ SUD (De Crescenzo, Cortese, \nAdamo, & Janiri, 2017). Treatment of adults\
      \ with ADHD often involves use of stimulant or nonstimulant \nmedication; although\
      \ efficacious in reducing psychiatric symptoms, they generally do not alleviate\
      \ SUD \nsymptoms (Cunill, Castells, Tobias, & Capella, 2015; De Crescenzo et\
      \ al., 2017; Luo & Levin, 2017). Thus, \nADHD medication alone is an insufficient\
      \ treatment approach for clients with these CODs (Crunelle et \nal., 2018; Zulauf\
      \ et al., 2014). Stimulant medications have misuse potential, and counselors\
      \ should be \nvigilant for signs of diversion. Use of long-acting or extended-release\
      \ medication or use of \nantidepressants instead of stimulants can attenuate\
      \ diversion and misuse liability. The advised approach \nto treatment involves\
      \ a combination of psychoeducation, behavioral coaching, CBT, and nonstimulant\
      \ or \nextended-release stimulant medication (De Crescenzo et al., 2017). \n\
      There is a dearth of research to support concurrent treatment of these conditions,\
      \ with some \nresearchers recommending first addressing whichever condition\
      \ is most debilitating to the client \n(Katzman et al., 2017; Klassen, Bilkey,\
      \ Katzman, & Chokka, 2012) and others suggesting that, in order to \nstabilize\
      \ the client, treatment of the SUD should be prioritized (Crunelle et al., 2018).\
      \ A systematic \nliterature review and meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy for\
      \ ADHD and SUD (Cunill et al., 2015) found no \neffect of timing of initiation\
      \ of treatment but warns that it may be necessary to delay treatment of \nADHD\
      \ symptoms until after abstinence is achieved given possible harmful interactions\
      \ that can occur \nbetween ADHD medications and substances of misuse.  \nCase\
      \ Study: Counseling an SUD Treatment Client With ADHD \nJohn R., a 29-year-old\
      \ White man, is seeking treatment. He has been in several treatment programs\
      \ but always \ndropped out after the first 4 weeks. He tells the counselor he\
      \ dropped out because he would get cravings and \nthat he just could not concentrate\
      \ in the treatment sessions. He mentions the difficulty of staying focused \n\
      during 3-hour intensive group sessions. A contributing factor in his quitting\
      \ treatment was that group leaders \nalways seemed to scold him for talking\
      \ to others. The clinician evaluating him asks how John R. did in school and\
      \ \nfinds that he had difficulty in his classwork years before he started using\
      \ alcohol and drugs; he was restless and \neasily distracted. He had been evaluated\
      \ for a learning disability and ADHD and took Ritalin for about 2 years (in\
      \ \nthe 5th and 6th grades), then stopped. He was not sure why, but he did terribly\
      \ in school, eventually dropping out \nabout the time he started using drugs\
      \ regularly in the 8th grade. \nDiscussion: The SUD treatment provider reviewed\
      \ John R.’s learning history and asked about anxiety or \ndepressive disorders.\
      \ The provider referred him to the team’s psychiatrist, who uncovered more history\
      \ about \nthe ADHD and also contacted John R.’s mother. When the provider reviewed\
      \ a list of features commonly \nassociated with ADHD, she agreed that John R.\
      \ had many of these features and that she had noticed them in \nchildhood. John\
      \ R. was started on bupropion and moved to a less intensive level of care (1\
      \ hour of group \ntherapy, 30 minutes of individual counseling, and AA meetings\
      \ 3 times weekly). Over the next 2 months, John \nR.’s ability to tolerate a\
      \ more intensive treatment improved. Although he was still somewhat intrusive\
      \ to others, \nhe was able to benefit from more intensive group treatment. \n\
      Feeding and Eating Disorders \nFeeding and eating disorders have as their common\
      \ core a persistent disturbance of eating or eating-\nrelated behavior, resulting\
      \ in changes in consumption or absorption of food that significantly impair\
      \ \nphysical health or psychosocial functioning. The primary eating disorders\
      \ linked to SUD and discussed in \nthis section are AN, bulimia nervosa (BN),\
      \ and binge eating disorder (BED)."

      Page 116 \nAN \nAN, the most visible eating disorder, is marked by a refusal\
      \ to maintain body weight above the minimally \nnormal weight for age and height\
      \ because of an intense fear of weight gain (Exhibit 4.13). The term AN \nmeans\
      \ “nervous loss of appetite,” a misnomer; only in extreme stages of inanition\
      \ (i.e., exhaustion as a \nresult of lack of nutrients in the blood) is appetite\
      \ actually lost. \nExhibit 4.13. Diagnostic Criteria for AN \nA. Restriction\
      \ of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low\
      \ body weight in the context \nof age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical\
      \ health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is \nless than\
      \ minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than minimally expected.\
      \  \nB. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior\
      \ that interferes with weight gain, \neven though at a significantly low weight.\
      \  \nC. Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced,\
      \ undue influence of body weight \nor shape on self-evaluation, or persistent\
      \ lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.  \n\
      Specify whether: \n• Restricting type: During the last 3 months, the individual\
      \ has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge \neating or purging behavior\
      \ (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).\
      \ This \nsubtype describes presentations in which weight loss is accomplished\
      \ primarily through dieting, fasting, \nand/or excessive exercise. \n• Binge-eating/purging\
      \ type: During the last 3 months, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes\
      \ of \nbinge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the\
      \ misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). \nSpecify if: \n• In partial remission:\
      \ After full criteria for AN were previously met, Criterion A (low body weight)\
      \ has not been \nmet for a sustained period, but either Criterion B (intense\
      \ fear of gaining weight or becoming fat or behavior \nthat interferes with\
      \ weight gain) or Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight and\
      \ shape) is still \nmet. \n• In full remission: After full criteria for AN were\
      \ previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a \nsustained period\
      \ of time. \nSpecify current severity: \nThe minimum level of severity is based,\
      \ for adults, on current body mass index (BMI) (see below) or, for children\
      \ \nand adolescents, BMI percentile. The ranges below are derived from WHO categories\
      \ for thinness in adults; for \nchildren and adolescents, corresponding BMI\
      \ percentiles should be used. The level of severity may be increased \nto reflect\
      \ clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and the need for supervision.\
      \ \n• Mild: BMI ≥ 17 kg/m2 \n• Moderate: BMI 16–16.99 kg/m2  \n• Severe: BMI\
      \ 15–15.99 kg/m2 \n• Extreme: BMI < 15 kg/m2 \nSource: APA (2013, pp. 338–339).\

      \ of AN severely limit their food intake, engage in excessive \nexercise, and\
      \ fast. Those with the binge-eating/purging subtype engage in episodes of binge\
      \ eating or \npurging with self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.\
      \ They engage in these behaviors out \nof a marked fear of weight gain, which\

      Page 117 \nBN \nThe core symptoms of BN are bingeing and purging (Exhibit 4.14).\
      \ A binge is a rapid consumption of an \nunusually large amount of food, by\
      \ comparison with social norms, in a discrete period of time (e.g., over \n\
      2 hours). Integral to the notion of a binge is feeling out of control; thus,\
      \ a binge is not merely overeating. \nAn individual with BN may state that he\
      \ or she is unable to postpone the binge or stop eating willfully \nonce the\
      \ binge has begun. The binge may only end when the individual is interrupted,\
      \ out of food, \nexhausted, or physically unable to consume more.  \nThe second\
      \ feature of BN is purging. There are many different ways that individuals with\
      \ BN \ncompensate for overeating. Ninety percent of people with BN self-induce\
      \ vomiting or misuse laxatives \nas their form of purging (Westmoreland, Krantz,\
      \ & Mehler, 2016). Other methods of purgation include \nthe misuse of diuretics\
      \ and emetics; saunas; excessive exercise; fasting; and other idiosyncratic\
      \ methods \nthat people believe will lead to weight loss (such as “mono” dieting,\
      \ in which a person eats only a single \nfood for extended periods of time and\
      \ nothing else, like apples or eggs). Many of these auxiliary \nmethods are\
      \ dangerous and ineffective as they promote loss of water and valuable electrolytes.\
      \ As with \nAN, individuals with BN place an undue emphasis on shape and weight\
      \ in their sense of identity. To \nmeet criteria, bingeing and purging must\
      \ occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months. \nExhibit 4.14. Diagnostic\
      \ Criteria for BN \n7. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge\
      \ eating is characterized by both of the \nfollowing:  \n1. Eating, in a discrete\
      \ period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is\
      \ definitely \nlarger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period\
      \ of time under similar circumstances  \n2. A sense of lack of control over\
      \ eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or\
      \ \ncontrol what or how much one is eating)  \nB. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory\
      \ behavior in order to prevent weight gain includes self-induced \nvomiting;\
      \ misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive\
      \ exercise.  \nC. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors\
      \ both occur, on average, at least once a week for \n3 months.  \nD. Self-evaluation\
      \ is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.  \nE. The disturbance does\
      \ not occur exclusively during episodes of AN \nSpecify if: \n• In partial remission:\
      \ After full criteria for BN were previously met, some, but not all, of the\
      \ criteria have been \nmet for a sustained period of time. \n• In full remission:\
      \ After full criteria for BN were previously met, none of the criteria have\
      \ been met for a \nsustained period of time. \nSpecify current severity: \n\
      The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappropriate compensatory\
      \ behaviors (see below). \nThe level of severity may be increased to reflect\
      \ other symptoms and the degree of functional disability. \n• Mild: An average\
      \ of 1–3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week \n• Moderate:\
      \ An average of 4–7 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week\
      \ \n• Severe: An average of 8–13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors\
      \ per week \n• Extreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory\
      \ behaviors per week \nSource: APA (2013, p. 345). Reprinted with permission\

      \ food in a short period of time than most \npeople would eat under similar\
      \ circumstances, with episodes marked by feelings of lack of control \n(Exhibit\

      \ is not followed by compensatory behaviors to rid the body of food. \nExhibit\
      \ 4.15. Diagnostic Criteria for BED \nA. Recurrent episodes of binge eating.\
      \ An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: \n1.\
      \ Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an\
      \ amount of food that is definitely \nlarger than what most individuals would\

      \ of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one\
      \ cannot stop eating or \ncontrol what or how much one is eating)  \nB. The\
      \ binge-eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following:\
      \ \n1. Eating much more rapidly than normal \n2. Eating until feeling uncomfortably\
      \ full \n3. Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry\
      \ \n4. Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating\
      \ \n5. Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward \
      \ \nC. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.  \nD. The binge eating\
      \ occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months. \nE. The binge eating\
      \ is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behavior\
      \ as in BN \nand does not occur exclusively during the course of BN or AN. \
      \ \nSpecify if: \n• In partial remission: After full criteria for binge-eating\
      \ disorder were previously met, binge eating occurs at \nan average frequency\
      \ of less than one episode per week for a sustained period of time. \n• In full\
      \ remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met,\
      \ none of the criteria have \nbeen met for a sustained period of time. \nSpecify\

      \ to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional disability. \n• Mild:\
      \ 1–3 binge-eating episodes per week \n• Moderate: 4–7 binge-eating episodes\

      \ \n0.80 percent, 0.28 percent, and 0.85 percent, respectively (Udo & Grilo,\
      \ 2018). These rates are generally \nlower than previously reported estimates\

      Page 119 \nAlthough feeding and eating disorders are rare, they are among the\
      \ deadliest of all mental disorders.  \n• Risk of death with AN is more than\
      \ 6 times higher than that of the general population, and the mortality risk\
      \ \nof BN is about 2 times higher than the general population (Schaumberg et\
      \ al., 2017).  \n• Mortality rates attributed to suicide are high. People with\
      \ AN are 18 to 31 times more likely to die by suicide \nthan the general population;\
      \ people with BN are 7.5 times more likely (Schaumberg et al., 2017). \nEating\
      \ disorders are far more prevalent in women than men. Women have 12 times the\
      \ odds of having \nAN, 5.8 times the odds of having BN, and about 3 times the\
      \ odds of having BED (Udo & Grilo, 2018). \nFeeding and Eating Disorders and\
      \ SUDs \nFeeding and eating disorders are highly coincident with substance misuse\
      \ (SAMHSA, 2011a), likely \nbecause the conditions share numerous physical,\
      \ mental, and social risk factors (Brewerton, 2014). Most \nstudies observe\
      \ comorbidity rates that exceed the general population of women of similar age.\
      \ A meta-\nanalysis (Bahji et al., 2019) found lifetime prevalence of any SUD\
      \ among people with eating disorders to \nbe 25 percent, including 20 percent\
      \ for AUD, about 20 percent for any illicit drug use disorder, almost 14 \n\
      percent for cocaine and cannabis use disorder (each), and 6 percent for opioid\
      \ use disorder (OUD). Even \nif not rising to the level of addiction, licit\
      \ and illicit substance use is elevated in people with eating \ndisorders, especially\
      \ individuals with bulimic features. In a sample of almost 3,000 people, 80\
      \ percent \nof those with BN reported using alcohol, and 50 percent used other\
      \ substances; 65 percent of those \nwith BED used alcohol, and nearly 24 percent\
      \ used other substances; and 60 percent of those with AN \n(binge/purge subtype)\
      \ used alcohol, and 44 percent used other substances (Fouladi et al., 2015).\
      \  \nSUD treatment-seeking women have higher rates of BN than any other feeding\
      \ and eating disorder, and \nSUDs are more common alongside BN or AN with bulimic\
      \ features than they are comorbid with \nrestrictive AN (APA, 2013; CSAT, 2009;\
      \ Fouladi et al., 2015). Some have suggested that the most \ncommon comorbidity\
      \ among feeding and eating disorders and SUDs is BN (or AN with bulimic features)\
      \ \nand AUD (Gregorowski, Seedat, & Jordaan, 2013; Munn-Chernoff et al., 2015).\
      \  \n \nTreatment outcomes of people with eating disorders and SUDs are worse\
      \ than those of people without \nboth conditions. They have higher odds of early\
      \ mortality, co-occurring physical and mental illness, and \ndelayed recovery\
      \ (Root et al., 2010). People in SUD treatment with feeding/eating disorder\
      \ symptoms \nhave higher risk of treatment dropout and discharge against medical\
      \ advice (Elmquist, Shorey, \nAnderson, & Stuart, 2015). Alcohol misuse more\
      \ than doubles mortality risk in AN (Franko et al., 2013). \n“Drunkorexia”:\
      \ A New and Dangerous Combination of Eating Disorders and Alcohol Misuse \n\
      Researchers are noticing a disturbing trend of college students (particularly\
      \ women) engaging in inappropriate \ncompensatory behaviors prior to consuming\
      \ alcohol in order to avoid or mitigate weight gain from drinking. For \ninstance,\
      \ a woman might fast all day or drastically reduce her caloric intake prior\
      \ to going out to a party where \nshe knows she will be drinking. This trend\
      \ has been colloquially termed “drunkorexia” (Barry & Piazza-Gardner, \n2012;\
      \ Bryant, Darkes, & Rahal, 2012; Burke, Cremeens, Vail-Smith, & Woolsey, 2010;\
      \ Hunt & Forbush, 2016; \nWilkerson, Hackman, Rush, Usdan, & Smith, 2017) and\
      \ is very serious given that excess consumption of alcohol \non an empty stomach\
      \ raises the risk of alcohol poisoning and damage to the brain and other organs.\
      \ In light of \nhigh rates of binge and hazardous drinking in college-aged populations,\
      \ this makes the combination of \ndisordered eating and alcohol misuse potentially\
      \ very dangerous."

      Page 120 \nTreatment of Feeding and Eating Disorders and SUDs \nFeeding or eating\
      \ disorders can make SUD assessment and treatment more complex—such as by raising\
      \ \nrisk of stopping SUD treatment against medical advice (Elmquist et al.,\
      \ 2015). Heightened mortality with \nfeeding and eating disorders means that\
      \ multidisciplinary care should include primary care providers \nand dietary/nutritional\
      \ rehabilitation professionals in addition to SUD treatment professionals, mental\
      \ \nhealth professionals (e.g., psychiatric and mental health nurses), and social\
      \ workers (SAMHSA, 2011a).  \nThe literature does not currently describe randomized\
      \ controlled trials for treatment of these CODs. In \ngeneral, concurrent treatment\
      \ is recommended; sequential interventions can increase likelihood of \nrelapse\
      \ or otherwise hinder recovery from the untreated CODs (Gregorowski et al.,\
      \ 2013). If integrated \ncare is not possible, SUD treatment should proceed\
      \ first to halt active substance use and allow the client \nto fully participate\
      \ in further care (SAMHSA, 2011a). Regardless of treatment modality, providers\
      \ must \nfirst ensure medical and weight stabilization so clients are healthy\
      \ and able to physically and cognitively \nparticipate in and benefit from therapy\
      \ (Harrop & Marlatt, 2010). Some clients with AN or BN may \nrequire inpatient\
      \ treatment or partial hospitalization to stabilize weight. Depending on the\
      \ facility, staff \nmay or may not be equipped to address any co-occurring substance\
      \ misuse simultaneously.  \nOnly 51 percent of SUD treatment programs report\
      \ screening clients for feeding and eating disorders (Kanbur \n& Harrison, 2016).\
      \ \nThe primary treatment for these disorders is psychosocial intervention,\
      \ including individual, group, \nfamily therapy, or a combination thereof. CBT\
      \ can be effective for feeding and eating disorders but has \nnot been researched\
      \ thoroughly in populations with co-occurring addiction (Gregorowski et al.,\
      \ 2013). \nDialectical behavior therapy also can be useful in promoting mindfulness,\
      \ improving management of \nnegative emotions, and teaching affective and behavioral\
      \ self-regulation skills in feeding and eating \ndisorders and in SUDs separately\
      \ (Ritschel, Lim, & Stewart, 2015) but, again, has not been studied \nextensively\
      \ in both concurrently. Pharmacotherapy may be warranted for BN and BED (SAMHSA,\
      \ 2011a) \nbut is not a first-line treatment. Further studies are needed to\
      \ clarify how the presence of a feeding or \neating disorder affects SUD treatment\
      \ and how best to integrate treatment for both conditions. \nAdvice to the Counselor:\
      \ Counseling a Client With an Eating Disorder \n• When possible, work closely\
      \ with a professional who specializes in eating disorders. Programs that specialize\
      \ \nin eating disorders and SUDs are rare, so parallel treatment by different\
      \ providers may be necessary.  \n• Screen for eating disorders both at intake\
      \ and intermittently throughout SUD treatment (e.g., during medical \nhistory,\
      \ as a part of SUD assessment, as a part of daily or weekly meetings). \n• Many\
      \ symptoms and features of eating disorders overlap with those of SUDs as well\
      \ as other mental \ndisorders, such as reduced food intake, low energy, depressed\
      \ affect, difficulty concentrating, and sleep \ndisturbance. This underscores\
      \ the importance of early screening and a thorough differential diagnosis. \n\
      • Addiction counselors may have a hard time detecting feeding and eating disorders\
      \ because clients are often \nadept at concealing their symptoms. Contrary to\
      \ popular belief, many people with feeding and eating \ndisorders are not exceedingly\
      \ thin. In fact, most people with BN are of normal weight or even overweight.\
      \ \nLearn the symptoms of AN, BN, and BED, and have screening tools and referral\
      \ information on hand for \nmental health professionals who can thoroughly assess\
      \ clients for possible eating disorders and symptoms. \nDo not merely look for\
      \ clients who “look like” they have an eating disorder. \n• The stereotypical\
      \ picture of someone with an eating disorder is a young, heterosexual, White\
      \ woman, but \nthese conditions occur in both genders, among diverse ethnic/racial\
      \ groups, across cultures, throughout the \nlifespan, and in people of all sexual\
      \ orientations and gender identities."

      \ the individual’s full repertoire of weight loss behaviors, as \npeople with\
      \ eating disorders will often go to dangerous extremes to lose weight.  \n•\
      \ Conduct a behavioral analysis of foods and substances of choice; high-risk\
      \ times and situations for engaging \nin disordered eating and substance misuse;\
      \ and the nature, pattern, and interrelationship of disordered \neating and\
      \ substance use. Develop a treatment plan for both the eating disorder and the\
      \ SUD.  \n• Use psychoeducation and CBT techniques.  \n• Use adjunctive strategies\
      \ such as nutritional consultation, the setting of a weight range goal, and\
      \ \nobservations at and between mealtimes for disordered eating behaviors. \
      \ \n• Incorporate relapse prevention strategies for a long course of treatment\
      \ and several treatment episodes. \n• In addition to “traditional” drugs of\
      \ misuse and alcohol, women with eating disorders are unique in their \nmisuse\
      \ of pharmacological agents ingested for the purpose of weight loss, appetite\
      \ suppression, and purging. \nAmong these drugs are prescription and over-the-counter\
      \ diet pills, laxatives, diuretics, and emetics. Nicotine \nand caffeine also\
      \ must be considered when assessing substance use in women with eating disorders.\
      \ \n• Drugs related to purging (e.g., diuretics, laxatives, emetics), are ineffective\
      \ and potentially dangerous \nmethods of accomplishing weight loss or maintenance.\
      \ The literature suggests that, like more common drugs \nof misuse, tolerance\
      \ and withdrawal occur with laxatives, diuretics, and possibly diet pills and\
      \ emetics. \n• Alcohol and substances such as cannabis can disinhibit appetite\
      \ (i.e., remove normal restraints on eating) \nand increase the risk of binge\
      \ eating as well as relapse in individuals with BN. \n• Clients with feeding\
      \ and eating disorders have craving, tolerance, and withdrawal from drugs linked\
      \ with \npurging (e.g., laxatives, diuretics) and urges (or cravings) for binge\
      \ foods similar to urges for substances. \n• Feeding and eating disorders are\
      \ quite serious and can be fatal. Treat them accordingly. \n• Suicide risk in\
      \ this population is perilously high. Regularly assess for suicidal thoughts,\
      \ gestures, and attempts \nand develop methods for safety monitoring and harm\
      \ prevention (e.g., safety plans). \nSubstance-Related Disorders \nThe primary\
      \ aim of this section of the chapter is to describe substance-induced mental\
      \ disorders and \nto clarify how to differentiate them from mental disorders\
      \ that co-occur with SUDs.   \nSubstance-related disorders include two subcategories:\
      \ SUDs and substance-induced disorders. SUDs \nidentify the cluster of cognitive,\
      \ behavioral, and physical symptoms that occur as a result of continued \nand\
      \ frequent use of substances. These consequences are not immediate. Rather,\
      \ they occur over time \nas addiction progresses. Substance-induced mental disorders\
      \ refer to the immediate effects of \nsubstance use (intoxication), the immediate\
      \ effects of discontinuing a substance (substance \nwithdrawal), and other substance-induced\
      \ mental disorders (APA, 2013)."

      \ behavioral, and physical symptoms indicating \nthat the individual continues\
      \ using the substance despite significant substance-related problems. All \n\
      DSM-5 SUDs have their own diagnostic criteria, but criteria are largely the\
      \ same across substances. \nAddiction counselors should be familiar with SUD\
      \ diagnostic criteria and refer to DSM-5 as needed.  \nPrevalence \nLifetime\
      \ and 12-month prevalence rates of DSM-5 drug use disorders (i.e., non-alcohol-related\
      \ SUDs) \nare nearly 10 percent and 4 percent, respectively (Grant et al., 2016).\
      \ Lifetime and 12-month prevalence \nrates of AUD are about 29 percent and 14\
      \ percent, respectively (Grant et al., 2015). Past-month \nprevalence rates\
      \ of misuse of other substances by adults ages 26 and older include (CBHSQ,\
      \ 2019): \n• \n8.6 percent for cannabis. \n• \n0.7 percent for cocaine. \n•\
      \ \n1.0 percent for pain relievers. \n• \n0.5 for tranquilizers. \n• \n0.4 percent\

      \ \nSubstance-Induced Mental Disorders  \nThe toxic effects of substances can\
      \ mimic mental disorders in ways that can be difficult to distinguish \nfrom\
      \ mental illness. This section focuses on a general description of symptoms\
      \ of mental illness that are \nthe result of substances or medications—a condition\
      \ called substance-induced mental disorders.  \nDSM-5 substance-induced mental\
      \ disorders include: \n• \nSubstance-induced depressive disorders. \n• \nSubstance-induced\
      \ bipolar and related disorders. \n• \nSubstance-induced anxiety disorders.\

      \ neurocognitive disorder. \nThe first four of the listed substance-induced\

      \ mental disorders are distinct from independent co-occurring mental disorders\
      \ in \nthat all or most of the psychiatric symptoms are the direct result of\
      \ substance use. This does not mean \nthat substance-induced disorders preclude\
      \ co-occurring mental disorders, only that the specific \nsymptom cluster at\
      \ a specific point in time is more likely the result of substance use, misuse,\
      \ \nintoxication, or withdrawal than of underlying mental illness.  \n \nWarning\
      \ to Counselors: Independent Versus Substance-Induced Mental Disorders \nThe\
      \ symptoms of substance-induced mental disorders may be identical to those of\
      \ independent but co-\noccurring mental disorders. Accurate assessment of a\
      \ mental disorder cannot occur while an individual is \nactively using substances.\
      \ Knowing the difference between the two is key because they may (or may not)\
      \ need \nto be treated differently and will have different prognoses. Mental\
      \ disorder symptoms resulting from \nintoxication or withdrawal often need no\
      \ formal treatment and will resolve on their own and quickly. \nAlso keep in\
      \ mind the bidirectional and unstable temporal relationship between mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs. It is \noften not clear whether a substance is causing psychiatric\
      \ symptoms or vice versa, and the answer can change \nover time. Each disorder\
      \ can affect one another reciprocally. Even when a substance clearly is responsible\
      \ for \nthe emergence of a mental disorder/psychiatric symptoms, that does not\
      \ preclude the possibility of an \nindependent mental disorder developing in\
      \ the future. In fact, it is possible to have both a substance-induced \nand\
      \ an independent mental disorder. For example, a client may present with well-established\
      \ independent and \ncontrolled bipolar I disorder and AUD in remission, but\
      \ the same client could be experiencing amphetamine-\ninduced auditory hallucinations\
      \ and paranoia from an amphetamine misuse relapse over the last 3 weeks."

      Page 124 \nEven when the psychiatric diagnosis has not been established, the\
      \ client’s co-occurring symptoms should still be \ntreated (with nonmedication).\
      \ Counselors should not withhold treatment simply because a determination \n\
      about the origin of the mental disorder has not yet been made. \nSymptoms of\
      \ substance-induced mental disorders run the gamut from mild anxiety and depression\
      \ \n(these are the most common across all substances) to full-blown manic and\
      \ other psychotic reactions \n(much less common). For example, acute withdrawal\
      \ symptoms from physiological depressants such as \nalcohol and benzodiazepines\
      \ are hyperactivity, elevated blood pressure, agitation, and anxiety (i.e.,\
      \ “the \nshakes”). On the other hand, those who “crash” from stimulants are\
      \ tired, withdrawn, and depressed.  \nBecause clients vary greatly in how they\
      \ respond to both intoxication and withdrawal given the same \nexposure to the\
      \ same substance, and also because different substances may be taken at the\
      \ same time, \nprediction of any particular substance-related syndrome has its\
      \ limits. What is most important is to \ncontinue to evaluate psychiatric symptoms\
      \ and their relationship to abstinence or ongoing substance \nmisuse over time.\
      \ Most substance-induced symptoms begin to improve within hours or days after\
      \ \nsubstance use has stopped. Notable exceptions to this are psychotic symptoms\
      \ caused by heavy and \nlong­term amphetamine misuse and dementia (e.g., problems\
      \ with memory, concentration, problem \nsolving) caused by using substances\
      \ directly toxic to the brain, which most commonly include alcohol, \ninhalants\
      \ like gasoline, and amphetamines.  \nExhibit 4.17 offers an overview of the\
      \ most common classes of misused substances and the \naccompanying psychiatric\
      \ symptoms seen in intoxication and withdrawal.  \nExhibit 4.17. Substance-Induced\
      \ Mental Disorder Symptoms (by Substance) \nAlcohol \nIntoxication. In most\
      \ people, moderate to heavy consumption is associated with euphoria, mood lability,\
      \ \ndecreased impulse control, and increased social confidence (i.e., getting\
      \ high). Symptoms may appear \nhypomanic but are often followed by next-day\
      \ mild fatigue, nausea, and dysphoria.  \nWithdrawal. Following acute withdrawal\
      \ (a few days), some people will experience continued mood instability, \nfatigue,\
      \ insomnia, reduced sexual interest, and hostility for weeks or months, so-called\
      \ “protracted withdrawal.” \nSymptoms of alcohol withdrawal include agitation,\
      \ anxiety, tremor, malaise, hyperreflexia (exaggeration of \nreflexes), mild\
      \ tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), increasing blood pressure, sweating, insomnia,\
      \ nausea or vomiting, \nand perceptual distortions. More severe withdrawal is\
      \ characterized by severe instability in vital signs, agitation, \nhallucinations,\
      \ delusions, and often seizures.  \nAlcohol-induced deliriums after high-dose\
      \ drinking are characterized by fluctuating mental status, confusion, \nand\
      \ disorientation and are reversible once both alcohol and its withdrawal symptoms\
      \ are gone. \nCannabis  \nIntoxication. Consumption typically results in a “high”\
      \ feeling followed by symptoms including euphoria, \nsedation, lethargy, impairment\
      \ in short-term memory, difficulty carrying out complex mental process, impaired\
      \ \njudgement, distorted sensory perceptions, impaired motor performance, and\
      \ the sensation that time is passing \nslowly. Occasionally, the individual\
      \ experiences anxiety (which may be severe), dysphoria, or social withdrawal.\
      \  \nWithdrawal. Cessation or substantial reduction in heavy or prolonged cannabis\
      \ use may result in fatigue, \nyawning, difficulty concentrating, and rebound\
      \ periods of increased appetite and hypersomnia that follow initial \nperiods\
      \ of loss of appetite and insomnia.  \nHallucinogens"

      \ hallucinations. Some people who use \nhallucinogens experience a marked distortion\
      \ of their sense of time and feelings of depersonalization. \nHallucinogens\
      \ may also be associated with drug-induced panic, paranoia, and even delusional\
      \ states in addition \nto the hallucinations. Hallucinogen hallucinations usually\
      \ are more visual (e.g., enhanced colors and shapes) as \ncompared with schizophrenic-type\
      \ hallucinations, which tend to be more auditory (e.g., voices). Phencyclidine\
      \ \n(PCP) causes dissociative and delusional symptoms and may lead to violent\
      \ behavior and amnesia of the \nintoxication.  \nOpioids \nIntoxication. Opioid\
      \ intoxication is characterized by intense euphoria and well-being. Withdrawal\
      \ results in \nagitation, severe body aches, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysphoria,\
      \ and craving to use more opioids.  \nWithdrawal. Symptoms during withdrawal\
      \ vary—some will become acutely anxious and agitated, whereas \nothers will\
      \ experience depression and anhedonia. Even with abstinence, anxiety, depression,\
      \ and sleep \ndisturbance can persist as a protracted withdrawal syndrome. \
      \ \nSedatives \nIntoxication. Acute intoxication with sedatives like diazepam\
      \ is similar to what is experienced with alcohol.  \nWithdrawal. Withdrawal\
      \ symptoms are also similar to alcohol and include mood instability with anxiety\
      \ or \ndepression, sleep disturbance, autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, nausea\
      \ or vomiting, and, in more severe cases, \ntransient hallucinations or illusions\
      \ and grand mal seizures. There are reports of a protracted withdrawal \nsyndrome\
      \ characterized by anxiety, depression, paresthesias, perceptual distortions,\
      \ muscle pain and twitching, \ntinnitus, dizziness, headache, derealization\
      \ and depersonalization, and impaired concentration. Most symptoms \nresolve\
      \ in weeks, but some symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, tinnitus, and paresthesias\
      \ (sensations such \nas prickling, burning, etc.), have been reported to last\
      \ a year or more after withdrawal for some.  \nStimulants (Includes Cocaine\
      \ and Amphetamines) \nIntoxication. Mild to moderate intoxication from cocaine,\
      \ methamphetamine, or other stimulants is associated \nwith euphoria, and a\
      \ sense of internal well-being, and perceived increased powers of thought, strength,\
      \ and \naccomplishment. In fact, low to moderate doses of amphetamines may actually\
      \ increase certain test-taking \nskills temporarily in those with ADHD and even\
      \ in people who do not have ADHD. However, as more substance \nis used and intoxication\
      \ increases, attention, ability to concentrate, and function decrease. \nWith\
      \ cocaine and methamphetamines, dosing is almost always beyond the functional\
      \ window. As dosage \nincreases, the chances of impulsive dangerous behaviors,\
      \ which may involve violence, promiscuous sexual \nactivity, and others, also\
      \ increases. \nWithdrawal. After intoxication comes a crash in which the person\
      \ is desperately fatigued, depressed, and often \ncraves more stimulant to relieve\
      \ these withdrawal symptoms. This dynamic is why it is thought that people who\
      \ \nmisuse stimulants often go on week- or month-long binges and have a hard\
      \ time stopping.  \nEven with several weeks of abstinence, many people who are\
      \ addicted to stimulants report a dysphoric state \nthat is marked by anhedonia\
      \ (absence of pleasure) or anxiety. Heavy, long-term amphetamine use appears\
      \ to \ncause long-term changes in the functional structure of the brain, and\
      \ this is accompanied by long-term \nproblems with concentration, memory, and,\
      \ at times, psychotic symptoms.  \nDiagnoses of substance-induced mental disorders\
      \ will typically be provisional and will require \nreevaluation—sometimes repeatedly.\
      \ Many apparent acute mental disorders may really be substance-\ninduced disorders,\
      \ such as in those clients who use substances and who are acutely suicidal.\
      \ \nSome people who appear to have substance-induced mental disorders turn out\
      \ to have a substance-\ninduced mental disorder and independent mental disorder.\
      \ Consider preexisting mood state, personal \nexpectations, drug dosage, and\
      \ environmental surroundings in understanding of how a particular client \n\
      might experience a substance-induced disorder. Treatment of the SUD and an abstinent\
      \ period of weeks \nor months may be required for a definitive diagnosis of\
      \ an independent, co-occurring mental disorder."

      Page 126 \nAs described in Chapter 3, SUD treatment programs and clinical staff\
      \ can concentrate on screening for \nmental disorders and determining the severity\
      \ and acuity of symptoms, along with an understanding of \nthe client’s support\
      \ network and overall life situation.  \nInduced Versus Independent Mental Disorders:\
      \ The Importance of Treatment \nIt will not always be clear whether a client’s\
      \ mental disorder or symptoms are independent or caused by long-\nterm substance\
      \ use or withdrawal. But it is inhumane and unethical to withhold treatment\
      \ until this \ndetermination is made. Individuals should be engaged in treatment\
      \ that addresses their co-occurring \npsychiatric symptoms, even if the origin\
      \ of the co-occurring mental disorder is unclear.  \nIf counselors struggle\
      \ to differentiate an independent from a substance-induced mental disorder,\
      \ they should: \n• Observe the client and watch for changes in symptoms (e.g.,\
      \ do symptoms abate once the person is \nabstinent from the substance for a\
      \ length of time?). \n• Reevaluate the client to help discern whether the symptoms/disorder\
      \ is caused by withdrawal, protracted \nwithdrawal, or the neurological effects\
      \ of chronic substance use. \n• Offer nonmedication treatment (e.g., SUD interventions\
      \ or mental health services) for all symptoms, \nregardless of whether a formal\
      \ diagnosis has been established. \nSpecific Substance-Induced Mental Disorders\
      \ \nThis section briefly discusses the most common substance-induced mental\
      \ disorders in clinical \npopulations: substance-induced depressive, anxiety,\
      \ bipolar, and psychotic disorders. Diagnostic criteria \nfor all substance-induced\
      \ mental disorders, including the four mentioned, are nearly identical and \n\
      comprise five general characteristics (Exhibit 4.18). \nExhibit 4.18. Features\
      \ of DSM-5 Substance-Induced Mental Disorders \nA. The disorder represents a\
      \ clinically significant symptomatic presentation of a relevant mental disorder.\

      \ findings of both of the following: \n1. The disorder developed during or within\
      \ 1 month of a substance intoxication or withdrawal or taking a \nmedication,\
      \ and;  \n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the mental\
      \ disorder.  \nC. The disorder is not better explained by an independent mental\
      \ disorder (i.e., one that is not substance- or \nmedication-induced). Such\
      \ evidence of an independent mental disorder could include the following:  \n\
      1. The disorder preceded the onset of severe intoxication or withdrawal or exposure\
      \ to the medication; \nor  \n2. The full mental disorder persisted for a substantial\
      \ period of time (e.g., at least 1 month) after the \ncessation of acute withdrawal\
      \ or severe intoxication or taking the medication. This criterion does not \n\
      apply to substance-induced neurocognitive disorders or hallucinogen persisting\
      \ perception disorder, \nwhich persist beyond the cessation of acute intoxication\
      \ or withdrawal.  \nD. The disorder does not occur exclusively during the course\
      \ of a delirium.  \nE. The disorder causes clinically significant distress or\
      \ impairment in social, occupational, or other important \nareas of functioning.\

      \ disorders \nThe lifetime prevalence of substance-induced depressive disorders\
      \ in the general community is 0.26 \npercent (Blanco et al., 2012). Observed\
      \ rates among clinical populations are much higher. For instance, \nin a study\
      \ of people seeking treatment for co-occurring depressive disorders and SUDs,\
      \ 24 percent had \nsubstance-induced depression; rates varied by substance.\
      \ Among those with 12-month alcohol \ndependence, prevalence of substance-induced\
      \ MDD was 22 percent; for past-year cocaine dependence, \n22 percent; and for\
      \ past-year heroin dependence, nearly 37 percent (Samet et al., 2013). In another\
      \ \nstudy of people with SUDs, 60 percent of people with depression had a substance-induced\
      \ rather than \nindependent depressive disorder (Conner et al., 2014). DSM-5\
      \ notes that although about 40 percent of \npeople with AUD develop MDD, only\
      \ about one-third to one-half are cases of independent depression, \nmeaning\
      \ as much as 75 percent of occurrences of depressive disorders in the context\
      \ of AUD could be \nbecause of intoxication or withdrawal (APA, 2013). Depressive\
      \ disorders or their symptoms could also \nbe because of the long-term effects\
      \ of substance use. \nDiagnosis of a substance-induced versus independent depressive\
      \ disorder can be difficult given that \nmany people with SUDs do have mood\
      \ symptoms, like depressed affect, and intoxication and \nwithdrawal from substances\
      \ can mirror symptoms of depression. During the first months of \nabstinence,\
      \ many people with SUDs may exhibit symptoms of depression that fade over time\
      \ and are \nrelated to acute withdrawal. Because depressive symptoms during\
      \ withdrawal and early recovery may \nresult from SUDs and not an underlying\
      \ depression, a period of time should elapse before depression is \ndiagnosed.\
      \ This does not preclude the importance of addressing depressive symptoms during\
      \ the early \nstage of recovery, before diagnosis. Further, even if an episode\
      \ of depression is substance induced, that \ndoes not mean that it should not\
      \ be treated. Overall, the process of addiction per se can result in \nbiopsychosocial\
      \ disintegration, leading to PDD or depression often lasting from months to\
      \ years. \nSubstance­induced mood alterations can result from acute and chronic\
      \ drug use as well as from drug \nwithdrawal. Substance­induced depressive disorders,\
      \ most notably acute depression lasting from hours \nto days, can result from\
      \ sedative–hypnotic intoxication. Similarly, prolonged or subacute withdrawal,\
      \ \nlasting from weeks to months, can cause episodes of depression, and sometimes\
      \ is accompanied by \nsuicidal ideation or attempts.  \nStimulant withdrawal\
      \ may provoke episodes of depression lasting from hours to days, especially\
      \ \nfollowing high­dose, chronic use. Acute stimulant withdrawal generally lasts\
      \ from several hours to 1"

      \ voracious appetite, and insomnia or \nhypersomnia (oversleeping). Depression\
      \ resulting from stimulant withdrawal may be severe and can be \nworsened by\
      \ the individual’s awareness of substance­use–related adverse consequences.\
      \ Symptoms of \ncraving for stimulants are likely and suicide is possible. Protracted\
      \ stimulant withdrawal often includes \nsustained episodes of anhedonia (absence\
      \ of pleasure) and lethargy with frequent ruminations and \ndreams about stimulant\
      \ use. There may be bursts of dysphoria, intense depression, insomnia, and \n\
      agitation for several months following stimulant cessation. These symptoms may\
      \ be either worsened or \nlessened depending on the provider’s treatment attitudes,\
      \ beliefs, and approaches. It is a delicate \nbalance—between allowing time\
      \ to observe the direction of symptoms to treating the client’s \npresenting\
      \ symptoms regardless of origin. \nSubstance-Induced Anxiety Disorders  \nThe\
      \ prevalence of substance-induced anxiety disorders in the community is unreported\
      \ and thought to \nbe quite low (less than 0.1 percent), although likely higher\
      \ in clinical samples (APA, 2013). \nLicit and illicit substances can cause\
      \ symptoms that are identical to those in anxiety. In addition, many \nmedications,\
      \ toxins, and medical procedures can cause or are associated with an eruption\
      \ of anxiety. \nMoreover, these reactions vary greatly from mild manifestations\
      \ of short­lived symptoms to full­blown \nmanic and other psychotic reactions,\
      \ which are not necessarily short lived. \nSymptoms that look like anxiety may\
      \ appear either during use or withdrawal. Alcohol, amphetamine \nand its derivatives,\
      \ cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, intoxicants and phencyclidine and its relatives\
      \ have \nbeen reported to cause the symptoms of anxiety during intoxication.\
      \ Withdrawal from alcohol, cocaine, \nillicit opioids, and also caffeine and\
      \ nicotine can also cause manifestations of anxiety. Similarly, \nwithdrawal\
      \ from depressants, opioids, and stimulants invariably includes potent anxiety\
      \ symptoms.  \nSubstance-Induced Bipolar Disorders \nEpidemiologic data on substance-induced\
      \ mania or bipolar disorders in the U.S. general population are \nnot readily\
      \ available. \nA number of substances of misuse (as well as prescribed medications\
      \ and several medical conditions) \nare also associated with manic-like phenomena.\
      \ Acute manic symptoms may be induced or mimicked \nby intoxication with stimulants,\
      \ steroids, hallucinogens, or polydrug combinations. They may also be \ncaused\
      \ by withdrawal from depressants such as alcohol. Individuals experiencing acute\
      \ mania with its \naccompanying hyperactivity, psychosis, and often aggressive\
      \ and impulsive behavior should be referred \nto emergency mental health professionals.\
      \  \nStimulant­induced episodes of mania may include symptoms of paranoia lasting\
      \ from hours to days. \nStimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines cause potent\
      \ psychomotor stimulation. Stimulant \nintoxication generally includes increased\
      \ mental and physical energy, feelings of well­being and \ngrandiosity, and\
      \ rapid, pressured speech. Chronic, high­dose stimulant intoxication, especially\
      \ with sleep \ndeprivation, may prompt a manic episode. Symptoms may include\
      \ euphoric, expansive, or irritable \nmood, often with flight of ideas, severe\
      \ social functioning impairment, and insomnia. \nSubstance-Induced Psychosis\
      \ \nThis condition is very rare; exact prevalence rates are unknown (APA, 2013).\
      \ In first-episode psychosis, 7 \npercent to 25 percent of cases are substance\
      \ induced (APA, 2013).  \nHeavy users of psychoactive substances, like cannabis,\
      \ amphetamines, and cocaine, are vulnerable to \nsubstance-induced psychosis,\
      \ especially clients with co­occurring schizophrenia and bipolar disorders."

      \ like prescribed steroids and \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral\

      \ and opioids. Any number of physical illnesses or medication reactions, from\
      \ brain \ntumors to steroid side effects, can cause a psychotic episode or psychotic\
      \ behavior. Virtually any \nsubstance taken in very large quantities over a\

      \ among psychotic disorders can be challenging, even for experienced clinicians\
      \ and \ndiagnosticians, especially when substances are involved. When a client\
      \ presents in a psychotic state, any \nimmediate or recent substance use is\
      \ difficult to determine, and it may be impossible to discern \nwhether the\
      \ hallucinations or delusions are caused by substance use. If the hallucinations\
      \ or delusions \ncan be attributed to substance use but are prominent and beyond\
      \ what one might expect from \nintoxication alone, the episode would be described\
      \ as a substance­induced psychotic disorder. \nHallucinations that the person\
      \ knows are solely the result of substance use are not considered indicative\
      \ \nof a psychotic episode; instead, they are diagnosed as substance intoxication\
      \ or substance withdrawal \nwith the specifier “with perceptual disturbances”\
      \ (APA, 2013). \nCase Studies: Identifying Disorders \nGeorge M. is a 37-year-old\
      \ divorced man who was brought to the ED intoxicated. His blood alcohol level\
      \ was \n0.27, and the toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. He was also\
      \ suicidal (“I’m going to do it right this \ntime!”). He has a history of three\
      \ psychiatric hospitalizations and two inpatient SUD treatments. Each \npsychiatric\
      \ admission was preceded by substance use. \nGeorge M. never followed through\
      \ with mental health services. He sometimes attended AA, but not recently. \n\
      Teresa G. is a 37-year-old divorced woman who was brought into a detoxification\
      \ unit 4 days ago with a blood \nalcohol level of 0.21. She is observed to be\
      \ depressed, withdrawn, with little energy, fleeting suicidal thoughts, \nand\
      \ poor concentration, but states she is just fine, not depressed, and life was\
      \ good last week before her \nrelapse. She has never used substances (other\
      \ than alcohol) and began drinking alcohol only 3 years ago. \nHowever, she\
      \ has had several alcohol-related problems since then. She has a history of\
      \ three psychiatric \nhospitalizations for depression, at ages 19, 23, and 32.\
      \ She reports a positive response to antidepressants. She is \ncurrently not\
      \ receiving mental health services or SUD treatment. She is diagnosed with AUD\
      \ (relapse) and \nsubstance-induced depressive disorder, with a likely history\
      \ of, but not active, major depression. \nDiscussion: Many factors must be examined\
      \ when making initial diagnostic and treatment decisions. For \nexample, if\
      \ George M.’s psychiatric admissions were 2 or 3 days long, usually with discharges\
      \ related to leaving \nagainst medical advice, decisions about diagnosis and\
      \ treatment would be different (i.e., it is likely this is a \nsubstance-induced\
      \ suicidal state and referral at discharge should be to an SUD treatment agency\
      \ rather than a \nmental health center) than if two of his psychiatric admissions\
      \ were 2 or 3 weeks long with clearly defined \nmanic and psychotic symptoms\
      \ continuing throughout the course, despite aggressive use of mental health\
      \ \nservices and medication (this is more likely a person with both bipolar\
      \ disorder and AUD who requires \nintegrated treatment for both his severe AUD\
      \ and bipolar disorder). \nSimilarly, if Teresa G. became increasingly depressed/withdrawn\
      \ in the past 3 months, and had for a month \nexperienced disordered sleep,\
      \ poor concentration, and suicidal thoughts, she would be best diagnosed with\
      \ \nMDD with acute alcohol relapse, not substance-induced depressive disorder\
      \ secondary to alcohol relapse. \nCross-Cutting Topics: Suicide and Trauma \n\
      Suicide risk and trauma status are relevant to care planning, client safety,\
      \ and treatment outcomes \nacross many CODs. This section briefly addresses\
      \ each issue and offers guidance to help addiction \ncounselors understand why\
      \ both need to be actively considered as part of assessment and treatment."

      Page 130 \nThere is ample literature about suicide, mental disorders, and addiction.\
      \ This section is not intended to \nthoroughly review all aspects of suicide-related\
      \ assessment, management, and prevention techniques \nfor COD populations; readers\
      \ instead are directed to TIP 50, Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\
      \ \nin Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT, 2009) for more information. The aim\
      \ of this text is to ensure \nreaders have a broad and general understanding\
      \ of the high risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in \nclients with CODs\
      \ and feel confident in knowing how to prevent and respond to such events. \
      \ \nSimilarly, trauma has been a significant topic of research in the behavioral\
      \ health literature. What \nfollows is an abbreviated summary of the link between\
      \ trauma and mental disorders and SUDs and how \naddiction counselors can offer\
      \ trauma-informed services. Readers should consult TIP 57, Trauma-\nInformed\
      \ Care in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA, 2014b) for more guidance in this\
      \ area. \nFor both suicide and trauma, readers are reminded to review Chapter\
      \ 3 for assessment techniques and \ntools, Appendix B for links to suicide prevention\
      \ materials and other resources, and Appendix C for \ncounselor tools like trauma\
      \ screeners.  \nSuicide \nSuicide is a common risk factor that pertains to nearly\
      \ all CODs and particularly those involving addiction \nand MDD, bipolar disorder,\
      \ schizophrenia, PTSD, or PDs (Yuodelis-Flores & Ries, 2015). Suicidality itself\
      \ is \nnot a mental disorder, but it is considered a high-risk behavior of significant\
      \ public health concern \n(Hogan & Grumet, 2016). Substance-induced or exacerbated\
      \ suicidal ideations, intentions, and \nbehaviors are possible complications\
      \ of SUDs, especially for clients with co-occurring mental disorders.  \nThe\
      \ topic of suicidality is critical for SUD treatment counselors working with\
      \ clients who have CODs. \nSUDs alone increase suicidality (Yuodelis-Flores\
      \ & Ries, 2015), whereas the added presence of some \nmental disorders doubles\
      \ the already heightened risk (O’Connor & Pirkis, 2016). The risk of suicide\
      \ is \ngreatest when relapse occurs after a substantial period of abstinence—especially\
      \ if there is concurrent \nfinancial or psychosocial loss. Every agency that\
      \ offers SUD counseling also must have a clear protocol \nin place that addresses\
      \ the recognition and treatment (or referral) of people who may be suicidal.\
      \ \nThese populations (Department of Health and Human Services, 2012) are vulnerable\
      \ to suicide risk; many are \nsusceptible to addiction or CODs as well: \n•\
      \ American Indians/Alaska Natives \n• Individuals who have lost a loved one\
      \ to suicide \n• Clients involved in criminal justice/child welfare systems\
      \ \n• Clients who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury \n• Individuals with a history\
      \ of previous suicide attempt \n• Individuals with physical health conditions\
      \ \n• Clients with mental disorders, SUDs, or both \n• Individuals in the LGBTQ\
      \ community \n• Members of the armed forces and veterans \n• Middle-aged and\
      \ older men \nPrevalence \nSuicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the\
      \ United States among people ages 10 and older (Stone \net al., 2019). Suicide\
      \ is the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 34 and the fourth\
      \ leading \ncause of death for those ages 35 and 54 (NIMH, 2019). Per the Centers\
      \ for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC), from 1999 to 2016, suicide rates\
      \ in the United States increased 28 percent, from 10.5 \nto 13.4 per 100,000\
      \ people (NIMH, 2018). Suicide rates among men remain nearly 4 times higher\
      \ (28.9 \nper 100,000 in 2017) than among women (7.7 per 100,000 in 2017) (CDC,\
      \ 2019). \nAlmost half (46 percent) of all individuals in the United States\
      \ who died by suicide between 2014 and \n2016 had a known mental health condition,\
      \ and 54 percent were in treatment at the time of death"

      Page 131 \n(Stone et al., 2019). Depression was the most common mental condition\
      \ diagnosis among those who \ncompleted suicide (75 percent); other major mental\
      \ disorder diagnoses included anxiety (17 percent), \nbipolar disorders (15\
      \ percent), schizophrenia (5 percent), and PTSD (4 percent) (Stone et al., 2019).\
      \  \nAccording to NSDUH data (CBHSQ, 2019), in 2018: \n• About 10.7 million\
      \ U.S. adults ages 18 or older thought seriously of dying by suicide (4.3 percent\
      \ of adults). \n• 3.3 million U.S. adults made suicide plans (1.3 percent).\
      \ \n• 1.4 million U.S. adults made nonfatal suicide attempts (0.6 percent).\
      \ \nSuicide and SUDs \nSubstance misuse makes people susceptible to self-harm;\
      \ indeed, suicide is the leading cause of death \namong people with addiction\
      \ (CSAT, 2009). From 2014 to 2016, 28 percent of people who died by \nsuicide\
      \ had problematic substance use, including 32 percent of people with a known\
      \ mental health issue \n(Stone et al., 2019). Of these individuals with known\
      \ psychiatric problems, 39 percent tested positive for \nalcohol, 39 percent\
      \ for benzodiazepines, 29 percent for opioids, 23 percent for cannabis, 10 percent\
      \ for \namphetamines, and 6 percent for cocaine (Stone et al., 2019).  \nAlcohol\
      \ factors prominently into suicide (Darvishi, Farhadi, Haghtalab, & Poorolajal,\
      \ 2015). Acute \nalcohol intoxication increases the risk of suicide attempt\
      \ by nearly 7 times and in some studies, if use \nis heavy, by as much as 37\
      \ times (Borges et al., 2017). This risk appears to increase with corresponding\
      \ \nincreases in consumption; as such, populations with AUD have higher rates\
      \ of suicide than people \nwithout problematic alcohol use (Yuodelis-Flores\
      \ & Ries, 2015). Other substances also carry an increased \nrisk of self-harm,\
      \ as suicidal behavior is prominent in OUD, cocaine use disorder, and polysubstance\
      \ use \n(Yuodelis-Flores & Ries, 2015). Among individuals with a history of\
      \ substance misuse who died by suicide \nin 2014 (Fowler, Jack, Lyons, Betz,\
      \ & Petrosky, 2018), the most commonly involved nonmedication \nsubstances were\
      \ alcohol (51 percent), opioids (23 percent), and cannabis (almost 14 percent).\
      \ \nFurthermore, among all suicide cases that year, opioids were the direct\
      \ cause of death in 27 percent of \npeople and alcohol in 13 percent (Fowler\
      \ et al., 2018). The overall suicide rate of U.S. veterans with an \nSUD is\
      \ estimated at 75.6 per 100,000 people and is highest among those who misuse\
      \ sedatives, followed \nby amphetamines, opioids, cannabis, alcohol, and cocaine\
      \ (Bohnert, Ilgen, Louzon, McCarthy, & Katz, \n2017). People who report misusing\
      \ prescription medication, and in particular pain relievers, also appear \n\
      to be vulnerable to suicidal ideation (Ford & Perna, 2015). \nThe link between\
      \ substance misuse and suicide may relate to the capacity of substances, especially\
      \ \nalcohol, to quell inhibition, leading to poor judgment, mood instability,\
      \ and impulsiveness. Depression, \ncomorbid with suicide risk and substance\
      \ misuse, may moderate this relationship. A population-based \nsample of people\
      \ currently using alcohol and with a history of depressed mood (Sung et al.,\
      \ 2016) found \nthat those with a positive history of suicide attempt were significantly\
      \ more likely than those without \nsuch a history to have problematic substance\
      \ use, including 21 percent with alcohol abuse or \ndependence and nearly 40\
      \ percent with illicit drug abuse or dependence. Yet alcohol dependence in this\
      \ \nsample significantly increased the odds of suicidal ideation and suicide\
      \ attempt even among people \nwithout a history of depressed mood. This suggests\
      \ that depressed mood alone cannot account for the \nrelationship between alcohol\
      \ misuse and risk of suicide, although it undoubtedly increases the odds.  \n\
      Many psychiatric illnesses have a heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors\
      \ further exacerbated \nin the presence of co-occurring addiction. Risk factors\
      \ for suicide that have been identified in the \ngeneral population, such as\
      \ a family history of suicide attempt or completion and access to firearms,\
      \ \nalso apply to people with CODs and make self-harm more likely. Additionally,\

      Page 132 \nCODs may be at even further risk based on the presence of contributing\
      \ factors that frequently appear \nin populations with mental disorders and\
      \ SUDs. For instance, having a chronic physical health condition \n(such as\
      \ traumatic brain injury or infectious disease), experiencing homelessness,\
      \ being a military \nveteran, and past involvement in the criminal justice system\
      \ are all associated with suicide-related \nideation, gestures, attempts, or\
      \ deaths (Ahmedani et al., 2017; Cook, 2013; Jahn et al., 2018; Kang et al.,\
      \ \n2015; Tsai & Cao, 2019) and may further compromise the safety of people\
      \ with CODs. A history of \nadverse life experiences, like childhood maltreatment\
      \ or intimate partner violence, also significantly \nincreases risk of self-harm\
      \ (especially in people with CODs) and is addressed in the section “Trauma.”\
      \ \nPrevention and Management of Suicidal Behaviors  \nAlthough a rare event,\
      \ suicide is often—but not always—preventable. All SUD treatment clients should\
      \ \nreceive at least a basic screening for suicidality, and all SUD treatment\
      \ professionals should know how \nto conduct at least basic screening and triage.\
      \ (To learn more about suicide screening, see Chapter 3 of \nthis TIP.) SAMHSA’s\
      \ Five-Step Evaluation and Triage (SAMHSA, 2009b) recommends using the following\
      \ \nprocess for identifying and responding to threat of self-harm: \n1. Identify\
      \ risk factors. \n2. Identify protective factors. \n3. Conduct a suicidal inquiry\
      \ into the client’s thoughts, plans, behaviors, and intents. \n4. Determine\
      \ the level of risk and appropriate interventions. \n5. Document risk, rationale,\
      \ intervention, and follow-up procedures. \nAddiction counselors should regularly\
      \ assess and monitor all clients with CODs for suicidal ideation, \ngestures,\
      \ plans, and attempts and especially clients with depressive disorders, bipolar\
      \ disorders, \nPTSD, schizophrenia, or PDs. Routine assessment should be an\
      \ integral part of treatment but is \nespecially critical during times of high\
      \ stress or increased substance use (including relapse) as well as at \nintake,\
      \ following any suicidal behavior, following reports of suicidal ideation, and\
      \ just before discharge. \nInformation should be collected on the client’s:\
      \ \n• \nPersonal and family history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. \n•\
      \ \nPlan for suicide. \n• \nReasons for not following through with past plans\
      \ for suicide. \n• \nReasons for not following through with the current plan\
      \ for suicide. \n• \nCurrent support system. \n• \nMeans and access to lethal\
      \ methods (e.g., firearms). \n• \nHistory and current symptoms of impulsivity.\
      \ \n• \nDepressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or both. \n• \nProtective\

      \ \nAsking a client directly about his or her desire to die by suicide does\
      \ not make self-harm more likely \nand in fact can yield helpful information.\
      \ Note that people may deny such thoughts or plans despite \nhaving them. Thus,\
      \ direct questioning alone is an insufficient risk mitigation strategy. Suicide\
      \ risk \nassessment scales might be useful in this regard (see Chapter 3 and\
      \ Appendix C for suicide risk and self-\nharm screening tools) but often lack\
      \ the specificity and sensitivity to adequately detect impending \nsuicidal\
      \ behaviors (Bolton, Gunnell, & Turecki, 2015). Providers also should not rely\
      \ solely on suicide \nmeasures. Instead, suicide screening should include thorough\
      \ investigation of all major signs, \nsymptoms, and risk factors associated\
      \ with self-harm in mental health, addiction, or COD populations. \nSafety planning\
      \ is critical in suicide risk mitigation. Suicide “contracts” are written statements\
      \ in which \nthe person who is suicidal states that he or she will not kill\
      \ himself but rather call for help, go to an ED, \nor other seek other assistance\
      \ if he or she becomes suicidal. These contracts are not effective alone for\
      \ \na client who is suicidal. Such contracts often help make clients and therapists\
      \ less anxious about a \nsuicidal condition, but studies have never shown these\
      \ contracts to be effective at preventing suicide. \nRather, safety contracts\
      \ help focus on the key elements that are most likely to keep clients safe,\
      \ such as \nagreeing to remove the means a client is most likely to use to commit\
      \ suicide. \nCounselors and other providers should know their own skills and\
      \ limitations in engaging, screening, \nassessing, and intervening with suicidal\
      \ clients and work out these problems with a supervisor before \nan emergency.\
      \ Providers also should know what immediate onsite and offsite resources are\
      \ available to \nhelp with someone identified as suicidal. To learn more about\
      \ suicide prevention, see “Resource Alert: \nSuicide Prevention Resources for\
      \ Counselors.” \nThere are no empirical treatments for suicide per se. However,\
      \ interventions that reduce symptoms of \nSUDs and mental illness can help mitigate\
      \ suicide risk and decrease self-harm behaviors by improving \nmood and enhancing\
      \ support and coping skills. Some research supports the use of psychotherapies\
      \ \nsuch as CBT and dialectical behavior therapy in reducing parasuicidal behavior\
      \ and suicide attempts, but \nthe overall evidence base is small (Bolton et\
      \ al., 2015). Pharmacotherapy—particularly \nantidepressants—can reduce suicidal\
      \ behavior in people ages 25 years and older. Yet paradoxically, \nsome studies\
      \ show that it actually increases suicide in people ages 25 and younger (Bolton\
      \ et al., 2015). \nCertain mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications also\
      \ may reduce self-harm in people with bipolar \ndisorder, schizophrenia, and\
      \ other psychotic disorders (Bolton et al., 2015).  \nThe first steps in suicide\
      \ intervention, and thus crisis stabilization, are contained in the process\
      \ of a good \nengagement and evaluation. Asking suicide­related questions, exploring\
      \ the context of those impulses, \nevaluating support systems, considering the\
      \ lethality of means, and assessing the client’s motivation"

      \ will often elicit the client’s own \ninsight and problem solving and may result\
      \ in a decrease in suicidal impulses. \nIf, however, the client experiences\
      \ little or no relief after this process, psychiatric intervention is \nrequired,\
      \ especially if the client has a co­occurring mental disorder or medical disorder\
      \ in which the risk \nof suicide is elevated or if the client has a history\
      \ of suicide attempts. If either or both is true, \narrangements should be made\
      \ for transfer to a facility that is capable of more intensive psychiatric \n\
      evaluation and treatment. Emergency procedures should be in place so the counselor\
      \ can accomplish \nthis transfer even when a psychiatrist or clinical supervisor/director\
      \ is not available. Once the client is \nstabilized and is safe to return to\
      \ a less restrictive setting, he or she should return to the program. \nCase\
      \ Study: Counseling an SUD Treatment Client Who Is Suicidal \nBeth, a 44-year-old\
      \ woman, comes to the SUD treatment center complaining that drinking too much\
      \ causes \nproblems for her. She has tried to stop drinking before but always\
      \ relapses. The counselor finds that she has \nbeen sleeping and eating poorly\
      \ and calling in sick to work. She spends much of the day crying and thinking\
      \ of \nhow alcohol, which destroyed her latest significant relationship, has\
      \ ruined her life. She takes pain medication \nfor a chronic back problem, which\
      \ complicates her situation. The counselor tells her of a therapy group that\
      \ is a \ngood fit, tells her how to register, and arranges some individual counseling\
      \ to set her on the right path. The \ncounselor tells her she has done the right\
      \ thing by coming in for help and offers encouragement about her \nability to\
      \ stop drinking. \nBeth misses her next appointment. The counselor calls her\
      \ home and learns from her roommate that Beth \nattempted suicide after leaving\
      \ the SUD treatment center. She took an overdose of opioids and is recovering\
      \ in \nthe hospital. The ED staff had found Beth under the influence of alcohol\
      \ upon admission. \nDiscussion: Although Beth provided information that showed\
      \ she was depressed, the counselor did not explore \nthe possibility of suicidal\
      \ thinking. Counselors always should ask if the client has been thinking of\
      \ suicide, \nwhether or not the client mentions depression. Clients, in general,\
      \ may not answer a very direct question or \nmay hint at something darker without\
      \ mentioning it directly. Interpreting the client’s response requires \nsensitivity\
      \ on the part of the counselor. It is important to realize that such questions\
      \ do not increase the \nlikelihood of suicide. Clients who, in fact, are contemplating\
      \ suicide are more likely to feel relieved that the \nsubject has now been brought\
      \ into the light and can be addressed with help from someone who cares. \nThe\
      \ client reports taking alcohol and pain medications. Alcohol impairs judgment\
      \ and, like pain medications, \ndepresses brain and body functions. The combination\
      \ of substances increases the risk of suicide or accidental \noverdose. Readers\
      \ are encouraged to think through this case and apply the risk assessment strategy\
      \ included in \nChapter 3 and use the tools in Appendix C, imagining what kind\
      \ of answers the counselor might have received. \nReaders could consider interventions\
      \ and referrals that would have been possible in their treatment settings. \n\
      \ \nAdvice to the Counselor: Counseling a Client Who Is Suicidal \n• All SUD\
      \ treatment clients should receive at least a brief screening for suicide, such\
      \ as: “In the past, have you \never been suicidal or made a suicide attempt?\
      \ Do you have any of those feelings now?”  \n• All SUD treatment staff should\
      \ be able to screen for suicidality and basic mental disorders (e.g., depression,\
      \ \nanxiety disorders, PTSD). \n• Screen for suicidal thoughts or plans with\
      \ anyone who makes suicidal references, appears seriously \ndepressed, or who\
      \ has a history of suicide attempts. Treat all suicide threats with seriousness.\
      \  \n• Inquire directly about a client’s depressed mood or agitation. For example:\
      \ \n− “You know, you seem to be pretty down. How depressed are you?” \n− The\
      \ issue may arise via general questions. For example, a client may state, “I\
      \ don’t use crack much \nanymore. I get really down when I’m coming off it.”\
      \ The counselor may then ask, “How down have you \ngotten? Were you ever suicidal?\
      \ How are you doing now?”"

      \ and reveal suicidality if the counselor responds \nto clues given by the client\
      \ and inquires sensitively about them. Saying, “You seem pretty uncomfortable\
      \ and \nnervous—is there something I can do to help?” to an agitated client\
      \ opens a door to further assessment. \n• If the client screens positive, use\
      \ the risk assessment strategy described in Chapter 3 to more thoroughly \n\
      investigate suicide intent. Further screening/assessment should be documented\
      \ to protect both the client \nand the counselor. This means writing information\

      \ items are not included on the form used. \n• Assess the client’s risk of self-harm\

      \ made to commit suicide, past attempts, current feelings, and protective factors.\
      \ (See Chapter 3 and \nAppendix C for a risk assessment protocol and screening\
      \ measures.)  \n• Develop a safety and risk management process with the client\
      \ that involves a commitment on the client’s \npart to follow advice, remove\
      \ the means to commit suicide (e.g., a gun), and agree to seek help and \ntreatment.\
      \ Avoid sole reliance on “no suicide contracts.”  \n• Assess the client’s risk\
      \ of harm to others.  \n• Clients who are actively suicidal should be evaluated\
      \ by a psychiatrist onsite immediately, or a case manager \nor counselor should\
      \ escort the client to emergency psychiatric services. Where available, mobile\

      \ management of the client who is suicidal. \n• Be caring and supportive. The\
      \ seriously suicidal client should have someone to contact 24 hours a day, and\
      \ \nfrequent telephone contact between the client and the contact person usually\
      \ is indicated. \n• Provide availability of contact 24 hours per day until psychiatric\
      \ referral is realized. Refer clients with serious \nplans, previous attempts,\
      \ or SMI for psychiatric intervention or obtain the assistance of a psychiatric\
      \ \nconsultant for the management of these clients.  \n• Monitor and develop\
      \ strategies to ensure medication adherence.  \n• Interventions should seek\
      \ to increase support available to the client from family and community, and\
      \ should \nprovide immediate interventions, including medication to stabilize\
      \ the client’s mental state, if needed. \n• Families and individuals often benefit\
      \ from education about depression and suicidality, including warning \nsigns,\
      \ resources for help, and the importance of addressing this problem. Education\
      \ often provides \nindividuals with a sense of hope and realistic expectations.\
      \ \n• Develop long-term recovery plans to treat substance misuse. Longer term\
      \ treatment concerns for a client \nwho has been suicidal focus on long­term\
      \ treatment strategies for CODs or on other risk factors that have \nculminated\
      \ in a suicidal event. In this case, treatment becomes long­term prevention.\
      \ \n• In people with serious and persistent mental disorders (e.g., bipolar\
      \ disorder), long­term medication \ncompliance is key in preventing suicide.\
      \ Just as essential as medication and medication compliance, however, \nis the\
      \ need to rebuild hope in the future and engender the belief that recovery from\
      \ co­occurring disorders is \npossible and that one has a sense of purpose,\
      \ value, empowerment, and role in one’s own recovery. \n• Review all such situations\
      \ with the supervisor or treatment team members.  \n• Document thoroughly all\
      \ client reports and counselor suggestions.  \nTrauma \nDSM-5 defines trauma\
      \ as “as exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence\
      \ \nin one or more of the following ways: (a) directly experiencing the traumatic\
      \ event; (b) witnessing, in \nperson, an event as it occurred to others; (c)\
      \ learning that the traumatic event occurred to a close family \nmember or close\
      \ friend; and (d) experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details\
      \ of the \ntraumatic event(s)” (APA, 2013, p. 271).  \nFor many people with\
      \ mental disorders, SUDs, or both, past or current trauma is a prominent driver\
      \ of \nnegative outcomes including but not limited to psychiatric hospitalizations;\
      \ suicide attempts; self-harm \nbehaviors; arrest; aggression; and substance\
      \ use initiation, escalation (from occasional use, to regular \nuse, to misuse/heavy\
      \ use/addiction), treatment dropout, and relapse (Kumar, Stowe Han, & Mancino,\
      \ \n2016; Lijffijt, Hu, & Swann, 2014; Stinson, Quinn, & Levenson, 2016). Data\

      Page 136 \nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Quinn et al., 2016)\
      \ confirm that exposure to childhood \ntrauma (e.g., sexual/emotional/physical\
      \ abuse, neglect, witnessing violence) significantly increases the \nrisk of\
      \ adulthood prescription pain reliever misuse (PPRM) and injection drug use.\
      \ This risk only grows as \nthe number of traumas experienced increases; in\
      \ the study, exposure to one trauma increased the risk \nof PPRM by 34 percent;\
      \ 2 traumas, by 50 percent; 3 traumas, by 70 percent; and 4 traumas, by 217\
      \ \npercent. Emotional and physical abuse nearly doubled the risk of injection\
      \ drug use. \nWarning to Counselors: Rethinking Trauma \nWhen providers hear\
      \ the term “trauma,” they probably get a specific picture in their mind of what\
      \ a client with \ntrauma looks like—a woman who has been physically abused by\
      \ her husband, a man who faced combat as a \nMarine, a woman who was date raped\
      \ while in college. These are indeed common examples of trauma, but \naddiction\
      \ counselors who only think of trauma in prototypical terms will overlook clients\
      \ who have faced \nadversities and are in need of help. When thinking about\
      \ clients with trauma: \n• Do not think only of women. Men experience trauma,\
      \ and although at lower rates than women, their \nadversities are just as serious\
      \ and potentially damaging. \n• Do not think only of military veterans or of\
      \ people who served in combat. Rates of trauma and PTSD are \ncertainly high\
      \ in military populations, but trauma happens to people from all walks of life.\
      \ Among active duty \nmilitary personnel and veterans, people can experience\
      \ trauma even if they were not directly involved in \ncombat. (See the section\
      \ “Special Considerations: Trauma and Military Personnel.” \n• Do not think\
      \ only of physical violence. Emotional abuse and neglect are damaging and can\
      \ have just as \nserious an impact as physical or sexual abuse (Norman et al.,\
      \ 2012). \n• Do not think only of young people. PTSD is less prevalent in older\
      \ adults, but up to 52 percent of people \nages 50 and older have had at least\
      \ one traumatic event in their lives (Choi, DiNitto, Marti, & Choi, 2017). \
      \ \n• Remember that someone may not have a PTSD diagnosis but still have PTSD\
      \ symptoms, a history of trauma, \nor both. These people may be just as much\
      \ in need of treatment as someone with a full-blown diagnosis. \nAlso, PTSD\
      \ and its symptoms are easily mistaken for other disorders, such as BPD and\
      \ depressive disorders \n(especially MDD). Although the person may not meet\
      \ sufficient criteria for PTSD, he or she may have \ntraumatic stress reactions\
      \ that need to be addressed. Subclinical traumatic stress reactions are more\
      \ \ncommonly expressed through depressive symptoms. Do not assume that just\
      \ because someone does not \nhave a PTSD diagnosis that he or she is not in\
      \ need of trauma-informed care. \nPrevalence \nTraumatic events are common in\
      \ people with CODs in part because they are so widely prevalent in the \ngeneral\
      \ population. Almost 90 percent of people in the United States have a lifetime\
      \ history of exposure \nto at least one traumatizing event, typically the death\
      \ of family/close friend because of \nviolence/accident/disaster; physical or\
      \ sexual assault; disaster; or accident/fire (Kilpatrick et al., 2013).  \n\
      Trauma and CODs \nAs noted in the section “PTSD,” trauma in people with addiction,\
      \ mental illness, or both is the norm \nrather than the exception (SAMHSA, 2014b).\
      \ In more than 600 people receiving SUD treatment, 49 \npercent reported a lifetime\
      \ history of physical or sexual abuse, and women were 5 times more likely \n\
      than men to report lifetime trauma (Keyser-Marcus et al., 2015). In people with\
      \ SMI, trauma exposure is \ncommon, with prevalence rates ranging from 25 percent\
      \ to 72 percent for physical abuse, 24 percent to \n49 percent for sexual abuse,\
      \ and 20 percent to 47 percent for PTSD (Mauritz, Goossens, Draijer, & van \n\
      Achterberg, 2013). Twelve-month or lifetime rates of DSM-5 drug use disorder\
      \ (i.e., an SUD excluding \nalcohol) carries increased odds of having PTSD (Grant\
      \ et al., 2016), and 12-month or lifetime PTSD \nincreases the odds of having\
      \ a past-year or lifetime SUD (Goldstein et al., 2016)."

      Page 137 \nAdverse life experiences are highly coincident with SUDs and mental\
      \ disorders, and vice versa: \n• \nCurrent PTSD prevalence in addiction populations\
      \ is likely 15 percent to 42 percent (Vujanovic et al., 2016). \n• \nIn active\
      \ duty military personnel, prevalence rates of various comorbid mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs in \npeople with PTSD have been estimated at 49 percent for depressive\
      \ disorders, 36 percent for GAD, \nand almost 27 percent for AUD (Walter, Levine,\
      \ Highfill-McRoy, Navarro, & Thomsen, 2018). \n• \nAmong a sample of U.S. adults\
      \ with any lifetime trauma, 47 percent screened positive for PTSD, \nalmost\
      \ 47 percent for GAD, and 42 percent for depression (Ghafoori, Barragan, & Palinkas,\
      \ 2014).  \n• \nBetween 28 percent and 43 percent of people with PTSD have an\
      \ SMI (Lu et al., 2013). \n• \nPeople with past-year or lifetime PTSD are at\
      \ significant risk of developing any number of comorbid \nmental disorders,\
      \ including, but not limited to, any mood disorder (2.4 to 3 times the odds),\
      \ bipolar I \ndisorder (2.1 to 2.2 times), any anxiety disorder (2.6 to 2.8\
      \ times), GAD (2 to 2.2 times), panic \ndisorder (2.1 times), and BPD (2.8 to\
      \ 3.3 times) (Goldstein et al., 2016). \n• \nPeople with adverse childhood events\
      \ (e.g., abuse, neglect) are more likely to report lifetime drug \nuse, past-year\
      \ moderate-to-heavy alcohol use, lifetime suicide attempt, and past-year depressed\
      \ \nmood than people without such a history (Merrick et al., 2017). Emotional\
      \ abuse in childhood is \nlinked with 6 times the odds for a lifetime suicide\
      \ attempt (Merrick et al., 2017). \nTrauma-Informed Treatment of CODs \nHistorically,\
      \ trauma has not been adequately addressed in SUD treatment, given provider\
      \ fear that doing \nso would worsen mental and addiction problems. However,\
      \ research indicates the opposite—that \nfailing to address trauma in people\
      \ with SUDs leads to worse outcomes (Brown, Harris, & Fallot, 2013). \nTrauma-informed\
      \ care means attending to trauma-related symptoms and also creating a treatment\
      \ \nenvironment that is responsive to the unique needs of individuals with histories\
      \ of trauma. Treatment is \nfocused on reducing specific symptoms and restoring\
      \ functioning but also broader goals like building \nresiliency, reestablishing\
      \ trust, preventing retraumatization, and offering hope for the future. Creating\
      \ a \nsupportive, safe treatment environment is crucial. Counselors must realize\
      \ how the setting and their \ninteractions with clients who have trauma can\
      \ affect treatment adherence, retention, and outcomes.  \nTrauma-informed care\
      \ for people with mental disorders, SUDs, or both often includes (SAMHSA, 2014b):\
      \ \n• \nPsychoeducation, especially about the relationship between trauma, mental\
      \ health, and addiction. \nPsychoeducation is also needed to help normalize\
      \ symptoms and reassure clients that their \nexperiences are not unusual, “wrong,”\
      \ or “bad.” \n• \nTeaching coping and problem-solving skills to foster effective\
      \ stress management. \n• \nDiscussing retraumatization and developing strategies\
      \ to prevent further victimization. \n• \nHelping clients feel empowered and\
      \ in control of their lives. \n• \nEstablishing a sense of safety in clients’\
      \ daily lives and in treatment. \n• \nPromoting resilience and offering hope\
      \ for change and improvement. \n• \nIdentifying and responding adaptatively\
      \ to triggers, like intrusive thoughts, feelings, and sensations. \n• \nBuilding\
      \ a therapeutic alliance, which fosters trust, confidence, and self-worth—all\
      \ keys to healing. \n• \nUsing trauma-specific interventions, like: \n− CBT.\
      \ \n− Cognitive processing therapy. \n− Exposure therapy."

      \ Chapter 6 discusses adapting treatments for CODs to female clients with trauma.\
      \ \nAdvice to the Counselor: Counseling a Client With Trauma \n• Clients need\
      \ not only to feel safe in the treatment environment, but also to feel safe\
      \ from their trauma \nsymptoms, many of which are intrusive, overwhelming, and\
      \ distressing. \n• Ensure interventions/interactions do not distress or traumatize\
      \ clients. Avoid:  \n− Being overly confrontational or argumentative with clients.\
      \ \n− Discounting and dismissing clients’ experiences and feelings. \n− Minimizing\
      \ or ignoring clients’ responses and needs. \n− Pushing clients to talk in greater\
      \ detail about their trauma. \n− Violating clients’ physical boundaries. \n\
      • Educate clients about the link between trauma and mental disorders, SUDs,\
      \ or both.  \n• Normalize clients’ reactions and feelings; this helps validate\
      \ their experiences and offers a sense of relief. \n• Help clients identify\
      \ triggers and learn more adaptive ways to cope and respond to them. This reduces\
      \ \nmaladaptive distress management strategies like substance use, self-injurious\
      \ behaviors, and avoidance. \n• Although trauma is an importance focus of treatment,\
      \ it does not need to be the sole focus. In fact, \nconstantly focusing on the\
      \ trauma can be overwhelming and emotionally draining for clients. \n• Include\
      \ specific SUD treatment approaches and techniques to address addiction symptoms.\
      \ \n• Use an integrated trauma and SUD recovery model that fully addresses mental\
      \ and substance-related needs. \n• Explore with clients their readiness for\
      \ change using the Stages of Change Model. This aids treatment \nmatching, fosters\
      \ better adherence/completion rates, and increases clients’ chances for long-term\
      \ recovery. \nSpecial Considerations: Trauma and Military Personnel \nActive\
      \ duty and veteran members of the military are highly susceptible to trauma\
      \ and all of its \ndeleterious aftereffects. PTSD prevalence is significantly\
      \ higher than that of the general population and \ncivilian clinical samples,\
      \ including 9 percent among a sample of more than 4 million veterans in primary\
      \ \ncare settings (Trivedi et al., 2015), 23 percent among Operations Enduring\
      \ Freedom and Iraqi Freedom \n(OEF/OIF) veterans (Fulton et al., 2015), 21 percent\
      \ in Gulf War veterans (Dursa, Barth, Schneiderman, & \nBossarte, 2016), and\
      \ 8.5 percent to 12.2 percent of Vietnam War veterans (Marmar et al., 2015).\
      \  \nAbout 20 percent of veterans have CODs (Trivedi et al., 2015); 16 percent\
      \ have PTSD and SUDs \nspecifically (Mansfield, Greenbaum, Schaper, Banducci,\
      \ & Rosen, 2017). In a sample of Operations \nEnduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom\
      \ veterans, 63 percent of people with SUD also had PTSD (Seal et al., \n2011).\
      \ Other common mental disorders in this population include SMI, depression,\
      \ and anxiety; all tend \nto co-occur often (Exhibit 4.20). These illnesses\
      \ are linked with increased hospitalizations, ED use, and \nmortality, with\
      \ SMI and SUDs being particularly damaging (Trivedi et al., 2015)."

      \ Trivedi et al. (2015).  \nMany veterans seek treatment outside of the Veterans\
      \ Health Administration, so community addiction \ncounselors should prepare\
      \ to work with them. Counseling veteran or active duty military populations\
      \ \nrequires a slightly different knowledge base, clinical approach, and skillset\
      \ than civilian populations. \nSUD counselors should note that (Briggs & Reneson,\
      \ 2010; Teeters, Lancaster, Brown, & Back, 2017): \n• \nWar zone stress reactions\
      \ often require specialized care and an understanding of the experiences \n\
      faced by soldiers in combat.  \n• \nMilitary-related trauma exposure does not\
      \ include only direct combat. For instance, people working \nin intelligence\
      \ gathering and medical personnel are often deployed to war zones where they\
      \ witness \nhorrific acts of violence and are potential targets of violence\
      \ themselves.  \n• \nFemale veterans often have specific service needs, such\
      \ as those to address military sexual trauma \n(e.g., sexual assault, harassment),\
      \ intimate partner violence, and childcare. (Note that men also can \nbe victims\
      \ of military sexual trauma, albeit at far lower rates than reported by women.\
      \ Do not \nassume that military sexual trauma is solely a women’s issue.) \n\
      • \nMany veterans are hesitant to seek SUD treatment or mental health services\
      \ because of fear that \ndoing so could negatively affect their career advancement.\
      \ Concerns about confidentiality are thus \nunderstandably very high in these\
      \ clients.  \n• \nShame, embarrassment, and stigma over mental health and addiction\
      \ are prominent. Military \nculture fosters some behaviors and mindsets that\
      \ can be adaptive in combat—like independence, \nbeing “masculine,” and not\
      \ showing “weakness”—but make seeking treatment much harder. \n• \nSuicide risk\
      \ is high in veterans. It requires active monitoring and management throughout\
      \ treatment, \nparticularly for military personnel with childhood trauma, PTSD,\
      \ military sexual trauma, or depression \n(Carroll, Currier, McCormick, & Drescher,\
      \ 2017; Cunningham et al., 2017; Kimerling, Makin-Byrd, \nLouzon, Ignacio, &\
      \ McCarthy, 2016; McKinney, Hirsch, & Britton, 2017; Pompili et al., 2013).\
      \  \nIndepth discussions about prevention programming and treatment for military\
      \ populations with trauma, \nsuicide risk, SUDs, mental disorders, or a combination\

      Chapter 5—Strategies for Working With \nPeople Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \  \n(For Counselors and Other Behavioral Health Service \nProviders, Supervisors,\
      \ and Administrators) \nEstablishing and maintaining a successful therapeutic\
      \ relationship with clients can enhance treatment \nengagement, participation,\
      \ and outcomes. Building a good therapeutic relationship with clients who \n\
      have CODs is especially important, yet doing so can be difficult. The first\
      \ part of this chapter reviews \nguidelines and techniques for building rapport\
      \ and optimizing outcomes when providing substance use \ndisorder (SUD) treatment\
      \ to clients who have CODs. The chapter also describes how to modify general\
      \ \ntreatment principles to suit the needs of clients with COD—particularly\
      \ useful when working with clients \nin Quadrants II and III. (Chapter 3 addresses\
      \ the Four Quadrants Model of service provision.) The second \npart describes\
      \ evidence-based techniques for building therapeutic rapport and effectively\
      \ counseling \nclients with CODs involving specific mental disorders—MDD, anxiety\
      \ disorders, PTSD, and SMI.   \nThe material in this chapter is consistent with\
      \ national or state consensus practice guidelines for COD \ntreatment and consonant\
      \ with many recommendations therein: \n• \nCounselors must be able to address\
      \ common clinical challenges, like managing feelings and biases \nthat could\
      \ arise when working with clients who have CODs (sometimes called countertransference).\
      \  \n• \nTogether, providers and clients should monitor clients’ disorders and\
      \ symptoms by examining the \nstatus of each disorder and alerting each other\
      \ to signs of relapse.  \n• \nCounselors can help clients with functional deficits\
      \ in areas such as understanding instructions by \nusing repetition, skill-building\
      \ strategies, and other accommodations to aid progress.  \n \n2 SMI: A diagnosable\
      \ mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder (other than developmental disorders\
      \ or SUDs) that \npersists long enough to meet diagnostic criteria and that\
      \ causes functional impairment sufficient to substantially \ndisrupt major life\
      \ activities (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA],\
      \ 2017).  \nKey Messages \nBuilding a positive therapeutic alliance is a cornerstone\
      \ of effective, high-quality, person-centered care for all \nclients, especially\
      \ those with co-occurring disorders (CODs). Clients with CODs often experience\
      \ stigma, \nmistrust, and low treatment engagement. \nCODs are complex and are\
      \ associated with certain clinical challenges that, if unaddressed, can compromise\
      \ the \ncounselor–client relationships and impinge on quality of care, potentially\
      \ leading to suboptimal outcomes. \nStrategies and approaches like empathic\
      \ support, motivational enhancement, relapse prevention techniques, \nand skill\
      \ building help strengthen clients’ ability to succeed and make long-term recovery\
      \ more likely.  \nCertain mental disorders are complex, chronic, and difficult\
      \ to treat, including major depressive disorder (MDD), \nanxiety disorders,\
      \ posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and serious mental illness2 (SMI). Clients\
      \ with these \ndisorders may have unique symptoms and limitations in function.\
      \  \nEmpirically based SUD treatment approaches can help counselors address\
      \ these unique symptoms and \nfunctional limitations in ways that will minimize\
      \ their potential to disrupt the therapeutic relationship and \nimpede positive\
      \ treatment outcomes."

      • \nThe consensus panel recommends that counselors primarily use a supportive,\
      \ empathic, and \nculturally responsive approach when working with clients who\
      \ have CODs. It is important to \ndistinguish behaviors and beliefs of cultural\
      \ origin from those that may indicate a mental disorder.  \n• \nCounselors and\
      \ other service providers should use motivational enhancement and relapse \n\
      prevention strategies consistent with each client’s specific stage of recovery.\
      \ These strategies are \nhelpful regardless of the severity of a client’s mental\
      \ disorder.   \nThroughout this chapter, Advice to the Counselor boxes highlight\
      \ practical guidance for counselors. \nCompetencies for Working With Clients\
      \ Who Have CODs  \nBefore establishing therapeutic rapport with clients who\
      \ have CODs, treatment providers first must \nensure that they possess integrated\
      \ competencies for working with the COD population. This means \nhaving the\
      \ specific attitudes, values, knowledge, and skills needed to provide appropriate\
      \ services to \nindividuals with CODs in the context of the providers’ job and\
      \ program setting. \nJust as other types of integration exist on a continuum,\
      \ so too does integrated competency. Some \ninterventions or programs require\
      \ only basic competency in welcoming, screening, and assessing \nindividuals\
      \ with CODs to identify their treatment needs. Other interventions, programs,\
      \ or job functions \n(e.g., those of supervisory staff) may require more advanced\
      \ integrated competency. Clients with more \ncomplex or unstable disorders require\
      \ providers with higher levels of integrated competency. They also \nrequire\
      \ more formal mechanisms within programs to coordinate various staff members\
      \ working with \nthat client to provide effective integrated treatment. \nThe\
      \ mental health service and SUD treatment systems are moving toward identification\
      \ of a basic, \nrequired level of integrated competency for all providers. Many\
      \ states are developing curricula for initial \nand ongoing training and supervision\
      \ to help providers achieve competency. Other states have created \ncareer ladders\
      \ and certification pathways to encourage providers to achieve greater competency\
      \ and to \nreward them for this achievement. (See Chapter 8 for further discussion\
      \ of counselor competencies.) \nGuidelines for a Successful Therapeutic Relationship\
      \  \nThis section reviews 10 guidelines for forming a good therapeutic relationship\
      \ with clients who have \nCODs and thereby increasing their chances of successful\
      \ long-term recovery. \n10 Guidelines for Developing Successful Therapeutic\
      \ Relationships With Clients Who Have CODs \n1. Develop and use a therapeutic\
      \ alliance to engage clients in treatment.  \n2. Maintain a recovery perspective.\
      \  \n3. Ensure continuity of care. \n4. Address common clinical challenges (e.g.,\
      \ countertransference, confidentiality). \n5. Monitor psychiatric symptoms (including\
      \ symptoms of self-harm). \n6. Use supportive and empathic counseling; adopt\
      \ a multiproblem viewpoint. \n7. Use culturally responsive methods. \n8. Use\
      \ motivational enhancement. \n9. Teach relapse prevention techniques. \n10.\
      \ Use repetition and skill building to address deficits in functioning."

      Develop and Use a Therapeutic Alliance To Engage Clients in Treatment \nResearch\
      \ suggests that a therapeutic alliance is a strong, if not essential, factor\
      \ in supporting recovery \nfrom mental disorders and SUDs (Kelly, Greene, &\
      \ Bergman, 2016; Shattock, Berry, Degnan, & Edge, \n2018; Zugai, Stein-Parbury,\
      \ & Roche, 2015). The therapeutic alliance can foster desirable outcomes by\
      \ \nimproving symptoms, functioning, treatment engagement, treatment satisfaction,\
      \ and quality of life \n(Dixon, Holoshitz, & Nossel, 2016; Kidd, Davidson, &\
      \ McKenzie, 2017). For clients with SMI (e.g., bipolar \ndisorder, schizophrenia),\
      \ better therapeutic alliance has been linked to a reduction in symptoms, fewer\
      \ \nhospitalizations, greater antipsychotic medication adherence, and improved\
      \ client self-esteem (Garcia et \nal., 2016; Shattock et al., 2018). Studies\
      \ of people with SUDs or CODs also suggest that a strong \ntherapeutic alliance\
      \ is a significant predictor of treatment retention, symptom reduction, enhanced\
      \ \nabstinence-related self-efficacy, and more days of abstinence (Campbell,\
      \ Guydish, Le, Wells, & McCarty, \n2015; Connors et al., 2016; Maisto et al.,\
      \ 2015).  \nHowever, the personal beliefs of individuals with CODs, such as\
      \ mistrust of treatment providers and fear \nof stigma, can be barriers to treatment\
      \ seeking, access, and engagement (Priester et al., 2016) and can \nmake establishing\
      \ a close, trusting client–provider relationship challenging. Developing a quality\
      \ \nrelationship with clients who have SMI and SUDs can be especially difficult.\
      \ Some individuals have little \ninsight, lower motivation to change, and less\
      \ ability to seek/access care than people without CODs \n(Pierre, 2018). Challenges\
      \ may be more apparent in clients with SUDs and co-occurring psychosis, as \n\
      they may have emotional/cognitive dysfunctions inhibiting ability to participate\
      \ in treatment (Priester et \nal., 2016). The presence and level of clinical\
      \ and functional deficits varies widely from one person with \nCODs to the next,\
      \ and among all people with CODs over the course of their illness and lifetime.\
      \  \nGiven the proliferation of research over the past few decades on technology-based\
      \ interventions in behavioral \nhealth services, some researchers have explored\
      \ how technology can affect client–counselor relationships in \nCOD treatment.\
      \ A pilot study from Ben-Zeev, Kaiser, and Krzos (2014) examined the use of\
      \ mobile phone \ntechnology to monitor clients with SMI and SUDs. Using daily\
      \ text messages over 12 weeks, team members \nroutinely texted clients (in what\
      \ the study authors termed “hovering”) reminders of upcoming appointments, \n\
      inquiries about medication adherence, general suggestions about managing symptoms,\
      \ and, as needed, crisis \nmanagement. At the end of the trial, participant\
      \ ratings of therapeutic alliance with providers who “hovered” \nwere significantly\
      \ higher than those for providers who did not use the intervention. Most clients\
      \ were satisfied \nwith the technology, and 87 percent said it helped them feel\
      \ more in control of their lives. \nTo foster treatment engagement for clients\
      \ with CODs, therapeutic relationships must build on clients’ \nexisting capacities.\
      \ The therapeutic alliance is the cornerstone of the COD recovery process. Once\
      \ \nestablished, the alliance is rewarding for both client and provider and\
      \ facilitates their joint participation \nin a full range of therapeutic activities.\
      \ Document alliance-building activities to help manage risk. \nAdvice to the\
      \ Counselor: Forming a Therapeutic Alliance \nThe consensus panel recommends\
      \ these approaches to form a therapeutic alliance with clients who have CODs:\
      \  \n• Demonstrate an understanding and acceptance of clients.  \n• Help clients\
      \ clarify the nature of their difficulties.  \n• Indicate that you will work\
      \ together with clients.  \n• Communicate to clients that you will help them\
      \ help themselves.  \n• Express empathy and a willingness to listen to clients’\
      \ conceptualization of their problems.  \n• Assist clients in solving external\
      \ problems directly and immediately."

      Maintain a Recovery Perspective \nVaried Meanings of “Recovery” \nThe word “recovery”\
      \ has different meanings in different contexts. SUD treatment providers may\
      \ think of \nclients who have changed their substance use behavior as being\
      \ “in recovery” for the rest of their lives \n(but not necessarily in formal\
      \ treatment forever). Mental health clinicians may think of recovery as a \n\
      process in which the client moves toward specific behavioral goals in stages;\
      \ in this conceptualization, \nrecovery is assessed by whether these goals are\
      \ achieved. In mutual support programs, recovery implies \nnot only abstinence\
      \ from substances but also a commitment to “working the program,” which includes\
      \ \ngroup members changing the way they act with others and taking responsibility\
      \ for their actions. People \nwith mental disorders may see recovery as the\
      \ process of reclaiming a meaningful life beyond mental \nillness, with symptom\
      \ control and positive life activity. \nGenerally, it is recognized that recovery\
      \ does not refer solely to a change in substance use but also to a \nchange\
      \ in an unhealthy way of living. Markers such as improved health, better ability\
      \ to care for oneself \nand others, increased independence, and enhanced self-worth\
      \ indicate progress in recovery. \nImplications of the Recovery Perspective\
      \ \nThe recovery perspective as developed in the SUD treatment field has two\
      \ main features: \n1. It acknowledges that recovery is a long-term process of\
      \ internal change. \n2. It recognizes that these internal changes proceed through\
      \ various stages (see De Leon [1996] \nand Prochaska et al. [1992] for a detailed\
      \ description). \nThe recovery perspective generates two main principles for\
      \ practice: \n• \nDevelop a treatment plan that provides for continuity of care\
      \ over time. In preparing this plan, the \nprovider should recognize that treatment\
      \ may occur in different settings over time (e.g., residential, \noutpatient).\
      \ The plan should reflect that much of the recovery process is client driven\
      \ and typically \noccurs outside of, or following, professional treatment (e.g.,\
      \ through participation in mutual \nsupport). Providers should reinforce long-term\
      \ participation in these settings. \n• \nUse interventions that match the tasks\
      \ and challenges specific to each stage of the COD recovery \nprocess. Doing\
      \ so enables providers to use sensible stepwise approaches in developing and\
      \ using \ntreatment protocols. Markers that are unique to individuals—such as\
      \ those related to their cultural, \nsocial, or spiritual context—should be\
      \ considered. Providers should engage clients in defining \nmarkers of progress\
      \ that are meaningful to them in each stage of recovery. \nAdvice to the Counselor:\
      \ Maintaining a Recovery Perspective \nThe consensus panel recommends these\
      \ approaches for maintaining a recovery perspective in treating CODs:  \n• Assess\
      \ each client’s stage of change (see the section “Using Motivational Enhancement”).\
      \ \n• Ensure that treatment stage and expectations are consistent with each\
      \ client’s stage of change.  \n• Use client empowerment to motivate change.\
      \  \n• Foster continuous support.  \n• Provide continuity of treatment.  \n\
      • Acknowledge that recovery is a long-term process; support and applaud even\
      \ small gains by clients."

      Stages of Change and Stages of Treatment \nWorking within the recovery perspective\
      \ requires a thorough understanding of the interrelationship \nbetween stages\

      \ & \nMcKendrick, 2000). The scales have a demonstrated relationship with retention\
      \ in general SUD \ntreatment populations and programs (Ali, Green, Daughters,\
      \ & Lejuez, 2017). A meta-analysis (Krebs, \nNorcross, Nicholson, & Prochaska,\
      \ 2018) found that client stage or readiness level of change predicted \npsychotherapy\
      \ outcomes among people with SUDs, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, depressive\
      \ \ndisorders, borderline personality disorder, and CODs (e.g., PTSD and alcohol\
      \ dependence). The authors \nsuggest tailoring goal-setting, treatment processes,\
      \ and resources to each client’s stage of change to \noptimize outcomes. Expectations\
      \ for clients’ progress through treatment stages (e.g., outreach, \nstabilization,\
      \ early-middle-late primary treatment, continuing care, long-term care) should\
      \ be consistent \nwith clients’ stages of change. \nClient Empowerment and Responsibility\
      \ \nThe recovery perspective emphasizes empowerment and responsibility of clients\
      \ and their network of \nfamily and significant others. Per Green, Yarborough,\
      \ Polen, Janoff, and Yarborough (2015), achieving \nsobriety can be a major\
      \ step in building clients’ feelings of self-efficacy and confidence to further\
      \ \nachieve recovery in SMI and can be a turning point in advancing their personal\
      \ growth, improving \nfunctioning, and meeting recovery goals. \nContinuous\
      \ Support \nThe recovery perspective highlights the need for continuing recovery\
      \ support. Providers encourage \nclients to build a support network that offers\
      \ respect, acceptance, and appreciation. For example, an \nimportant element\
      \ of long-term participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the offering of\
      \ a place of \nbelonging or a “home.” AA offers this supportive environment\
      \ without producing overdependence \nbecause members are expected to contribute,\
      \ as well as receive, support.  \nAdvice to the Counselor: Mitigating Relapse\
      \ By Managing the Recovery Environment \nTo guide clients through recovery and\
      \ ensure delivery of comprehensive, recovery-oriented care, counselors \nmust\
      \ help clients establish and maintain a supportive recovery environment. This\
      \ environment is more than \nwhere clients live; it compasses clients’ entire\
      \ physical, emotional, social, educational, and vocational world.  \nUnderstanding\
      \ limitations in clients’ recovery environments is critical to helping them\
      \ prevent relapse and \nproblem solve barriers. Environmental obstacles and\
      \ lack of support can sabotage clients’ recovery efforts and \ncan be difficult\
      \ to overcome without assistance from a mental health or addiction professional.\
      \  \nCounselors can help clients with CODs create a life conducive to recovery\
      \ by assessing areas and offering \nservices relevant to the American Society\
      \ of Addiction Medicine’s Patient Placement Criteria, Third Revision, \nDomain\
      \ 6 (Mee-Lee et al., 2013). This means working with clients to identify and\
      \ explore: \n• The client’s current living situation, including the physical\
      \ living space, the people who co-occupy their home, \nand the surrounding community\
      \ (e.g., Is it safe? Is it disruptive to recovery? Does the client live in an\
      \ area \nwhere illicit substances are easily accessible?). \n• The client’s\
      \ available supports for all biopsychosocial needs, whether related to illness\
      \ or broader areas of \nliving, like social life, work, and relationships. For\
      \ instance, does the client have reliable transportation? What"

      about childcare? Does the client have people in his or her life to rely on for\
      \ tangible and emotional support? \nIs the client able to maintain primary care\
      \ and behavioral health appointments? \n• Threats to support in the client’s\
      \ life, such as friends or loved ones who actively misuse substances or family\
      \ \nmembers who are unsupportive of SUD treatment? \n• Whether the client engages\
      \ in peer support, 12-Step support, or other mutual support programs. \n• Educational\
      \ or occupational matters that facilitate or hinder recovery. For instance,\
      \ is the client employed? \nDoes his or her supervisor know that the client\
      \ is in recovery (and supportive of this)? Is the client working to \ncomplete\

      \ the client is involved in the criminal justice system, child welfare system,\
      \ or both. \n• Whether the client needs financial assistance (e.g., applying\
      \ for Social Security Disability Insurance). \nEnsure Continuity of Care \n\
      Continuity of treatment flows from a recovery perspective and is a guiding principle\
      \ in its own right. \nContinuity of treatment implies that COD services are\
      \ constant. Treatment continuity for clients with \nCODs begins with proper,\
      \ thorough identification, assessment, and diagnosis. Per a review by McCallum,\
      \ \net al. (2015), continuity of care for people with CODs means providing:\
      \ \n• \nCare that is regular and consistent over time. \n• \nCare that is continually\
      \ adjusted to the client’s needs.  \n• \nContinuity in the counselor–client\
      \ relationship, such as through ongoing and reliable contact. \n• \nContinuity\
      \ across services via case management, coordination of care, and linkage to\
      \ resources.  \n• \nContinuity in the transfer of care, including maintaining\
      \ contact (as appropriate) even after handoff. \nOn a program level (Padwa,\
      \ Larkins, Crevecoeur-MacPhail, & Grella, 2013), continuity of care for clients\
      \ \nwith CODs can include having structures, procedures, and training in place\
      \ that enables providers to:  \n• \nAssess and monitor mental disorder and SUD\
      \ symptoms. \n• \nDevelop discharge planning that continually supports clients\
      \ through community resources (e.g., \npeer recovery support services, mutual\
      \ support). \n• \nFor people on pharmacotherapy, ensure medication needs are\
      \ met (e.g., medication checks are \nscheduled, prescription refill procedures\
      \ are in place). \nMore discussion of how counselors can ensure continuity of\
      \ care for clients with CODs across different \ntreatment settings can be found\
      \ in Chapters 2 and 7. \nAddress Common Clinical Challenges \nEase Discomfort\
      \ and Reluctance \nProviders’ ease in working toward a therapeutic alliance\
      \ is affected by their comfort level in working \nwith clients who have CODs.\
      \ SUD counselors may find some clients with SMI or severe SUDs to be \nthreatening\
      \ or unsettling. This discomfort may result from lack of experience, training,\
      \ or mentoring. \nLikewise, some mental health clinicians may feel uncomfortable\
      \ or intimidated by clients with SUDs. It is \ntherefore important to recognize\
      \ certain patterns that invite these feelings and not to let them interfere\
      \ \nwith clients’ treatment. Providers who find it challenging to form a therapeutic\
      \ alliance with clients who \nhave CODs should consider whether their difficulty\
      \ is related to:"

      • \nThe client’s difficulties. \n• \nA limitation in their own experience and\
      \ skills. \n• \nDemographic differences between themselves and their clients\
      \ in areas such as age, gender, \neducation, socioeconomic status, race, or\
      \ ethnicity. \n• \nCountertransference (see the section “Manage Countertransference”).\
      \  \nA consultation with a supervisor or peer to discuss this issue is important.\
      \ Often these reactions can be \novercome with further experience, training,\
      \ supervision, and mentoring. \nIndividuals with CODs may also feel challenged\
      \ in forming a therapeutic relationship with their \ntreatment providers. They\
      \ often experience demoralization and despair, given the complexity of having\
      \ \nmultiple behavioral health concerns and the difficulty of achieving treatment\
      \ success. Inspiring hope \noften is a necessary precursor for clients to give\
      \ up short-term relief for long-term work with some \nuncertainty in timeframe\
      \ and benefit. \nManage Countertransference \nProviders should understand difficulties\
      \ related to countertransference and be familiar with strategies \nto manage\
      \ it. Although the concept of countertransference is somewhat dated and infrequently\
      \ used in \nthe COD literature, it can help providers understand how their past\
      \ experiences can influence current \nattitudes toward certain clients. Transference\
      \ describes the process whereby clients project attitudes, \nfeelings, reactions,\
      \ and images from the past onto their providers. For example, the client may\
      \ regard \nthe provider as an “authoritative father,” “know-it-all older brother,”\
      \ or “interfering mother.” \nCountertransference is now understood to be a normal\
      \ part of providers’ treatment experience. \nParticularly when working with\
      \ clients who have multiple, complicated problems, providers are as \nvulnerable\
      \ as clients to feelings of pessimism, despair, and anger, as well as desires\
      \ to abandon \ntreatment. Less experienced providers may find it harder to identify\
      \ countertransference, access \nfeelings evoked by interactions with clients,\
      \ name those feelings, and keep feelings from interfering with \nthe counseling\
      \ relationship. \nAdvice to the Counselor: Managing Countertransference \nThe\
      \ consensus panel recommends this approach to manage countertransference with\
      \ clients who have CODs: \n• Be aware of strong personal reactions and biases\
      \ toward clients.  \n• Get further supervision when countertransference is suspected\
      \ and may be interfering with counseling.  \n• Receive formal and periodic clinical\
      \ supervision; they should have opportunities to discuss \ncountertransference\
      \ with their supervisors and with other staff at clinical team meetings.  \n\
      SUDs and mental disorders are stigmatized by the general public. Stigma can\
      \ also be present among \nproviders. Mental health clinicians who usually do\
      \ not treat people with SUDs may not have worked out \ntheir own responses to\
      \ substance misuse, which can influence their interactions with these clients.\
      \ \nProviders working with clients who have SMI may have more negative beliefs\
      \ about and express more \nnegative attitudes toward clients with SMI than those\
      \ without such diagnoses (Smith, Mittal, Chekuri, \nHan, & Sullivan, 2017; Stone\
      \ et al., 2019). Providers who treat clients with SMI can benefit from working\
      \ \nwith supervisors to uncover and correct underlying harmful thoughts and\
      \ attitudes.  \nSimilarly, SUD treatment providers may be unaware of their own\
      \ reactions to people with specific \nmental disorders and may have difficulty\
      \ preventing these reactions from influencing treatment. Their"

      negative attitudes or beliefs may be communicated, directly or subtly, to the\
      \ client—for example, \nthrough thoughts like, “I was depressed too, but I never\
      \ took medications for it—I just worked the Steps \nand got over it. So why\
      \ should this guy need medication?” \nNegative feelings generated by countertransference\
      \ can worsen over time. Some research indicates \nthat providers treating clients\
      \ with CODs may feel less satisfied with their jobs and increasingly \nfrustrated\
      \ with their clients the longer they stay in practice (Avery et al., 2016).\
      \  \nProviders’ negative attitudes toward clients with CODs can have a significant\
      \ impact on treatment \nservices and outcomes. For example, countertransference\
      \ may result in providers failing to offer timely, \nappropriate treatment and\
      \ having poor communication with their clients (Avery et al., 2016). (For a\
      \ full \ndiscussion of countertransference in SUD treatment, see Powell & Brodsky,\
      \ 1993.) Countertransference \nproblems are particularly significant when working\
      \ with people who have CODs, because people with \nSUDs and mental disorders\
      \ may evoke strong feelings in providers that could become barriers to \ntreatment\
      \ if providers allow such feelings to interfere. Providers may feel angry, used,\
      \ overwhelmed, \nconfused, anxious, uncertain how to proceed with a case, or\
      \ just worn out. \nCultural concerns may cause strong yet unspoken feelings,\
      \ creating countertransference and transference. \nCounselors working with clients\
      \ in their area of expertise may be familiar with countertransference, but \n\
      working with an unfamiliar population will introduce different kinds and combinations\
      \ of feelings. \nProtect Confidentiality \nConfidentiality and privacy are relevant\
      \ to every clinical situation and are especially important for \nclients with\
      \ SMI, SUDs, or both. These conditions can be complex and debilitating, and\
      \ they are \nassociated with an increased risk of harm to self and others. Furthermore,\
      \ people receiving SUD \ntreatment in federally funded programs are protected\
      \ by additional regulations that affect information \nsharing, privacy, and\
      \ consent. More information about these regulations is available online \n(www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs).\
      \  \nHowever, confidentiality is not absolute. Contexts in which to be mindful\
      \ of protections—and the \nlimitations of those protections—related to client\
      \ privacy and confidentiality, include: \n• \nWhen collaborating with other\
      \ providers, especially those outside of the behavioral health field. \nAll\
      \ clients have a right to privacy and confidentiality. There are federal as\
      \ well as state regulations \nthat dictate the type of information providers\
      \ can share with other providers while upholding those \nrights for their clients.\
      \ Remember that counselors who practice in more than one location are \nbeholden\
      \ to the regulations in all of the states in which they see clients. (See “Resource\
      \ Alert: \nFederal and State Mental Health Privacy and Confidentiality Regulations.”)\
      \ \nProviders have a duty to be aware of federal rules under the Health Insurance\
      \ Portability and Accountability \nAct and any additional regulations in their\
      \ states dictating what information they can and cannot share with \nother providers\
      \ (as well as caregivers and family members) and under which circumstances.\
      \ \n• \nWhen working in a setting with electronic health records (EHRs). The\
      \ proliferation of EHRs has \nhelped foster easier record sharing between mental\
      \ health and general medical clinicians but also \nposes a risk to confidentiality\
      \ that, if breached, could seriously damage client trust in the counselor \n\
      and in the psychotherapy process in general (Shenoy & Appel, 2017).  \n• \n\
      When working with clients who verbalize specific threats of harm to a third\
      \ party. If the counselor \nhas reason to believe a violent act is foreseeable\
      \ and is directed at a specific person, breach of \nconfidentiality may be appropriate\
      \ or even required by the state’s duty to warn mandate."

      \ to involve family members, when appropriate, without jeopardizing \nclient\
      \ privacy and confidentiality. Families often want to be involved in the care\
      \ of a loved one with \nCODs—especially if the individual has a history of nonadherence\
      \ to medication and other treatment and \ndoes not have other support systems\
      \ in place. Sometimes, family members or caregivers must be \ninvolved because\
      \ the client lacks capacity to make independent healthcare decisions.  \nRecommended\
      \ practices for involving families (Rowe, 2012) in a client’s COD treatment\
      \ include: \n• \nInvolving family members in planning and implementing treatments\
      \ to the extent possible (after \ndiscussing their involvement with the client\
      \ and obtaining his or her written consent). \n• \nConveying the same respect\
      \ and empathy toward family members as toward clients to build rapport. \n•\
      \ \nDeveloping a contract that spells out what type of information families\
      \ will and will not receive and \nwhat role they can play in their loved one’s\
      \ treatment."

      Monitor Psychiatric Symptoms \nJoint Treatment Planning \nWhen SUD counselors\
      \ work with clients who have CODs, especially those who need medications or\
      \ \nare receiving mental health services separately from SUD treatment, it is\
      \ especially important that \nthey participate in developing client treatment\
      \ plans and monitoring clients’ psychiatric symptoms. \nThe SUD counselor should,\
      \ at minimum, be knowledgeable of the overall treatment plan to permit \nreinforcement\
      \ of the plan’s mental health aspects as well as aspects specific to recovery\
      \ from SUDs. It is \nequally important for clients to participate in developing\
      \ their COD treatment plans.  \nFor example, for a client with bipolar disorder\
      \ and alcohol use disorder (AUD) who is receiving \ntreatment at both an SUD\
      \ treatment agency and a local mental health center, the treatment plan might\
      \ \ninclude individual SUD treatment counseling, medication management, and\
      \ group therapy. In another \nexample, for a client taking lithium, the SUD\
      \ treatment provider may assist in medication monitoring by \nasking such questions\
      \ as, “How are your meds helping you? Are you remembering to take them? Are\
      \ \nyou having any problems with them? Do you need to check in with the prescribing\
      \ doctor?”  \nPsychiatric Medications \nIt is prudent for providers to ask clients\
      \ with CODs to bring in all medications to counseling sessions. \nProviders\
      \ can then ask clients in what manner, when, and how they are taking medications.\
      \ They can \nalso ask whether clients feel that the medication is helping them,\
      \ and how. Doing so presents an \nopportunity for providers and their clients\
      \ to review and discuss attitudes toward medication and \nclients’ typical patterns\
      \ in taking medication. Some clients may not disclose that they have discontinued\
      \ \ntheir medications, but when asked to bring in their medications, they may\
      \ bring medication bottles that \nare completely full. Providers should help\
      \ educate clients about the effects of medication, teach \nclients to monitor\
      \ themselves (if possible), and consult with clients’ physicians whenever appropriate.\
      \ \nAdvice to the Counselor: Monitoring Psychiatric Symptoms \nThe consensus\
      \ panel recommends these approaches to monitoring psychiatric symptoms in clients\
      \ with CODs:  \n• Obtain a mental status examination to evaluate clients’ overall\
      \ mental health and danger profile. Ask about \nclients’ symptoms and use of\
      \ medication and look for signs of mental disorders regularly.  \n• Keep track\
      \ of changes in symptoms.  \n• Ask clients directly and regularly about the\
      \ extent of their depression and associated suicidal thoughts.  \nStatus of\
      \ Psychiatric Symptoms \nSUD counselors should monitor changes in severity and\
      \ number of psychiatric symptoms over time. For \nexample, most clients present\
      \ for SUD treatment with anxiety or depressive symptoms. Such symptoms \nare\
      \ substance induced (see Chapter 4) if they occur within 30 days of intoxication\
      \ or withdrawal. \nSubstance-induced symptoms tend to follow the principle of\
      \ “what goes up, must come down,” and vice \nversa. Clients who have just ended\
      \ a binge on stimulants will seem tired and depressed (clients using \nmethamphetamines\
      \ may present with psychotic symptoms that require medication). Conversely,\
      \ those \nwho recently stopped taking depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids) will\
      \ likely seem agitated and anxious. \nThese substance-induced symptoms result\
      \ from substance withdrawal and usually persist for days or \nweeks. Substance-related\
      \ depression may follow (which can be seen as a neurotransmitter depletion \n\
      state) and may begin to improve within a few weeks. If depressive or other symptoms\
      \ persist, then a co-"

      occurring (additional) mental disorder is likely, and a differential diagnostic\
      \ process should ensue. Such \nsymptoms may be appropriate targets for establishing\
      \ a diagnosis or determining treatment choices.  \nSUD treatment providers can\
      \ use various tools to help monitor psychiatric symptoms. Some tools \nconsist\
      \ only of questions and require no formal instrument. For example, to gauge\
      \ the status of \ndepression quickly, providers can ask a client: “On a scale\
      \ of 0 to 10, with 0 being your best day and 10 \nyour worst, how depressed\
      \ are you?” This simple scale, used from session to session, can provide much\
      \ \nuseful information. SUD treatment providers should also monitor adherence\
      \ to prescribed medication \nby asking clients regularly for information about\
      \ their use of these medications and their effects. \nTo identify changes, providers\
      \ should track psychiatric symptoms clients mention at the outset of \ntreatment\
      \ from week to week. For example, one may ask, “Last week you mentioned low\
      \ appetite, \nsleeplessness, and feeling hopeless—are these symptoms better\
      \ or worse now?” Providers should also \nascertain whether clients follow their\
      \ suggestions to alleviate symptoms, and if so, with what result.  \nChapter\
      \ 3 and Appendix C also address screening and assessment tools for mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs. \nPotential for Harm to Self or Others \nAccording to the Centers\
      \ for Disease Control and Prevention (2018), 46 percent of people who die by\
      \ \nsuicide have a known mental health issue; 28 percent have problematic substance\
      \ use. Individuals with \nCODs are at increased risk of self-harm (e.g., cutting,\
      \ suicide attempt) or harm to others compared with \npeople who do not have\
      \ CODs (Carra et al., 2014; Haviland, Banta, Sonne, & Przekop, 2016; Tiet &\
      \ \nSchutte, 2012).  \nProviders should always ask explicitly about suicide\
      \ or the intention to harm someone else when \nclient assessment indicates that\
      \ either is an issue. For clients who mention or seem to be experiencing \n\
      depression or sadness, explore the extent to which suicidal thinking is present.\
      \ (To learn about duty to \nwarn laws in each state, see “Resource Alert: Federal\
      \ and State Mental Health Privacy and \nConfidentiality Regulations” in the\
      \ previous section of this chapter.) \nFollow-up services for clients who screen\
      \ positive for suicide risk or have attempted suicide or other \nself-injurious\
      \ behaviors may effectively prevent future harmful behaviors (including completed\
      \ suicides), \nbut more research in this area is needed (Brown & Green, 2014).\
      \ Follow-up services can include: \n• \nConducting a full suicide risk assessment\
      \ (see Chapter 3). \n• \nContacting the client (e.g., sending letters or postcards)\
      \ to express care and concern. \n• \nScheduling follow-up appointments in person\
      \ or by phone to discuss the treatment plan. \n• \nMaking home visits (as appropriate).\
      \ \n• \nAdministering follow-up psychiatric and suicide risk assessments throughout\
      \ the course of care. \nChapter 4 covers general approaches to preventing suicide\
      \ and managing clients who have attempted \nsuicide or are at risk for self-harm.\
      \ Instructions on screening for risk of harm to self or others appear in \n\
      Chapter 3 and Appendix C. \nUse Supportive and Empathic Counseling \nA supportive\
      \ and empathic counseling style is one of the keys to establishing an effective\
      \ therapeutic \nalliance with clients who have CODs. According to Lockwood,\
      \ empathy is “the ability to vicariously \nexperience and to understand the\
      \ affect of other people”; it is the foundation adults use for relating to \n\
      and interacting with other adults (Lockwood, 2016, p. 256)."

      In empathic counseling, providers model behaviors that can help clients build\
      \ more productive \nrelationships. Providers’ empathy helps clients begin to\
      \ recognize and own their feelings, which is an \nessential step toward managing\
      \ them. In learning to recognize and manage their own feelings, clients \nwill\
      \ also learn to empathize with the feelings of others.  \nEmpathic counseling\
      \ must be consistent over time to keep the alliance intact, especially for clients\
      \ \nwith CODs. Clients with CODs often have lower motivation to address mental\
      \ illness or substance \nmisuse, find it harder to understand and relate to\
      \ others, and need strong support and understanding to \nmake major lifestyle\
      \ changes such as adopting abstinence. Support and empathy from providers can\
      \ \nhelp maintain the therapeutic alliance, increase client motivation, and\
      \ assist with medication adherence.  \nConfrontation and Empathy \nHistorically,\
      \ addiction research defined confrontation as an aggressive, argumentative communication\
      \ \ntactic to pressure people who misused substances into treatment. Confrontation\
      \ has more recently \ncome to be seen as a supportive, honest approach to warning\
      \ or advising at-risk individuals about \nharmful behaviors (Polcin, Galloway,\
      \ Bond, Korcha, & Greenfield, 2010; Polcin, Mulia, & Laura, 2012). \nAdvice\
      \ to the Counselor: Using an Empathic Style \nEmpathy is a key skill for the\
      \ SUD counselor, without which little could be accomplished. Bell (2018, p.111)\
      \ \nnotes that “it is the job of counselor educators and supervisors to instill\
      \ and nourish the trait of empathy, while \nbuilding skills that relay empathy\
      \ to the client.” An empathic style is one that: \n• Involves taking the client’s\
      \ perspective and trying to see life from his or her worldview. \n• Tries to\
      \ connect with clients who are difficult or are engaging in behaviors the counselor\
      \ disagrees with or \ncannot otherwise relate to (e.g., misusing substances,\
      \ breaking the law). \n• Is mindful, compassionate, and warm rather than judgmental\
      \ and accusatory. \n• Is focused on listening to—rather than talking at—the\
      \ client. \n• Includes nonverbal communication (e.g., pen body positioning,\
      \ direct eye contact, nodding along). \n• Conveys reflective listening via techniques\
      \ like repetition and parroting, using verbal cues like “I see” or “Tell \n\
      me more about that,” and paraphrasing content and feelings (“So, you’re saying\
      \ that he left, and then you \ndecided to go to the bar. Do I have that right?”\
      \ or “I hear that you were extremely angry about that”). \n• Demonstrates comfort\
      \ by expressing sympathy, consolation, and reflexive reassurance (i.e., phrasing\
      \ \ndesigned to alleviate anxiety and worry without promising a certain outcome—such\
      \ as saying, “Just give it \nyour best shot, and let’s see how things play out”\
      \ instead of saying, “Everything will be just fine”). \nSee also Treatment Improvement\
      \ Protocol (TIP) 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder\
      \ \nTreatment (SAMHSA, 2019d).  \nSources: Bell (2018); Kelley & Kelley (2013).\
      \ \nSUD treatment providers often feel tension between offering clients empathic\
      \ support and addressing \nclients’ potential minimization, evasion, dishonesty,\
      \ and denial. However, providers can be empathic \nand firm at once. Straightforward,\
      \ factual presentation of conflicting material or problematic behavior in \n\
      an inquisitive, caring manner can be confrontational yet supportive. Achieving\
      \ a balance of empathy \nand firmness is critical for providers to maintain\
      \ therapeutic alliances with clients who have CODs.  \nStructure and Support\
      \ \nClients with CODs benefit from a careful balance of structured versus free\
      \ time. Free time is both a \ntrigger for substance use cravings and a negative\
      \ influence for many individuals with mental disorders. \nThus, management of\
      \ free time is of particular concern for clients with CODs. Clients with CODs\
      \ need \nstrategies to better manage their free time, such as by structuring\
      \ one’s day to include meaningful"

      activities and to avoid activities that are risky. Providers can help clients\
      \ plan their free time (especially \nweekends) to introduce new pleasurable\
      \ activities that may alleviate symptoms and offer satisfaction \nthrough means\
      \ other than substance use. Other activities that can help structure clients’\
      \ time are \nworking on vocational and relationship matters in treatment. \n\
      In addition to structure, it is also important that clients’ daily activities\
      \ contain opportunities for \nreceiving support and encouragement. Counselors\
      \ should work with clients to create a healthy support \nsystem of friends,\
      \ family, and activities. \nMutual support is a key tool providers can introduce\
      \ to clients with CODs. Dual recovery mutual \nsupports are increasingly available\
      \ in most large communities. Providers play an important role in \nhelping clients\
      \ with CODs access and benefit from such resources. (Chapter 7 has more information\
      \ on \nmutual support approaches for people with CODs.) If groups for clients\
      \ who do not speak English are \nunavailable locally, providers can seek resources\
      \ in nearby communities or, if the number of clients in \nneed warrants, initiate\
      \ organization of a group for those who speak the same non-English language.\
      \ \nA provider can assist a client with CODs in accessing mutual support by:\
      \ \n• \nHelping the client locate an appropriate group. The provider should\
      \ be aware of available local \nmutual support programs and dual recovery mutual\
      \ support groups, especially those that are \nfriendly to clients with CODs,\
      \ have other members with CODs, or are designed specifically for people \nwith\
      \ CODs. The provider can gain awareness by visiting groups to see how they are\
      \ conducted, \ndiscussing groups with colleagues, updating personal lists of\
      \ groups periodically, and gathering \ninformation from clients. The provider\
      \ should ensure that the group selected is a good fit for the \nclient in terms\
      \ of its members’ ages, genders, and cultural characteristics. Some communities\
      \ offer \nalternatives to mutual support groups, such as Secular Organizations\
      \ for Sobriety. \n• \nHelping the client prepare to participate appropriately\
      \ in the group. Some clients, particularly \nthose with SMI or anxiety about\
      \ group participation, benefit when providers offer an explanation of \nthe\
      \ group process in advance. The provider should inform the client of the structure\
      \ of a meeting, \nexpectations of sharing, and how to participate. The client\
      \ may need to rehearse the kinds of things \nthat are and are not appropriate\
      \ to share at such meetings. The provider should also teach the client \nhow\
      \ to “pass” and when this would be appropriate. The counselor should be familiar\
      \ enough with \ngroup function and dynamics to walk the client through the meeting\
      \ process before attending. \n• \nHelping overcome barriers to group participation.\
      \ The provider should be aware of the genuine \ndifficulties the client may\
      \ have in connecting with a group. Although clients with CODs, like any \nothers,\
      \ may have some ambivalence about change, they also may have legitimate barriers\
      \ they \ncannot remove on their own. For example, a client with cognitive difficulties\
      \ may need help working \nout how he or she can physically get to the meeting.\
      \ The provider may need to write down detailed \ninstructions for this client\
      \ that another would not need (e.g., “Catch the number 9 bus on the other \n\
      side of the street from the treatment center, get off at Main Street, and walk\
      \ 3 blocks to the left to \nthe white church. Walk in at the basement entrance\
      \ and go to Room 5.”) \n• \nDebriefing the client after he or she has attended\
      \ a mutual support group to help process \nreactions and prepare for future\
      \ attendance. The provider’s work does not end with referral to a \nmutual support\
      \ group. The provider must be prepared to help the client overcome any obstacles\
      \ \nafter attending the first group to ensure engagement. Often, this involves\
      \ a discussion of the client’s \nreaction to the group and a clarification of\
      \ how he or she can participate in future groups. \nCase Study: Helping a Client\

      Use Culturally Appropriate Methods \nResearch is lacking on the ethnic/racial\
      \ diversity of populations with CODs. Limited published studies \nsuggest that\
      \ although CODs are more frequently observed among Whites, non-White Americans\
      \ also \nexperience CODs. A report (Mericle, Ta Park, Holck, & Arria, 2012)\
      \ estimated lifetime prevalence of \nCODs at 5.8 percent among Latinos, 5.4\
      \ percent among African Americans, and 2.1 percent among \nAsians. Whites, by\
      \ comparison, had a lifetime prevalence of 8.2 percent.  \nNotable gaps exist\
      \ in the rates of behavioral health service access, utilization, and completion\
      \ among \ndiverse racial and ethnic groups compared with Whites (Cook, Trinh,\
      \ Li, Hou, & Progovac, 2017; Holden \net al., 2014; Maura & Weisman de Mamani,\
      \ 2017; Nam, Matejkowski, & Lee, 2017; Saloner & Le Cook, \n2013; Sanchez, Ybarra,\
      \ Chapa, & Martinez, 2016). This is attributable to multiple factors such as\
      \ \nunderassessment, underdiagnosis, and underreferral (Priester et al., 2016)\
      \ as well as cultural barriers \nlike language differences, fear of stigma,\
      \ and shame (Holden et al., 2014; Keen, Whitehead, Clifford, \nRose, & Latimer,\
      \ 2014; Masson et al., 2013; Maura & Weisman de Mamani, 2017; Pinedo, Zemore,\
      \ & \nRogers, 2018). Culturally responsive care and cultural competence training\
      \ among behavioral health \nstaff are needed to help break down barriers to\
      \ service access and improve treatment outcomes for \ndiverse populations with\
      \ CODs. \nUnderstanding Clients’ Cultural Backgrounds \nPopulation shifts are\
      \ resulting in increasing numbers of diverse racial and ethnic groups in the\
      \ United \nStates (Colby & Ortman, 2014). Each geographic area has its own cultural\
      \ mix. Providers are advised to \nlearn as much as possible about the cultures\
      \ represented in their treatment populations. To provide \neffective COD treatment\
      \ to people of various cultural groups, providers should learn as much as \n\
      possible about characteristics of their clients’ cultural groups.  \nOf particular\
      \ importance are culturally based conventions of social interaction, styles\
      \ of interpersonal \ncommunication, concepts of healing, views of mental illness,\
      \ and perceptions of substance use. For \nexample, some cultures may tend to\
      \ somaticize symptoms of mental disorders, and clients from such \ngroups may\
      \ expect treatment providers to offer relief for physical complaints. These\
      \ clients may be \noffended by too many probing, personal questions early in\
      \ treatment and never return.  \nLinda, a 24-year-old woman, had attended her\
      \ mutual support group for about 3 months. Although she knew \nshe should ask\
      \ someone to sponsor her, she was shy and afraid of rejection. She had identified\
      \ a few women \nwho might be good sponsors, but each week in counseling, she\
      \ stated that she was afraid to reach out. No one \nhad approached her about\
      \ sponsorship either, although the group members seemed “friendly enough.” The\
      \ \ncounselor suggested that Linda share, in the next group meeting, that she’d\
      \ like a sponsor but has been feeling \nshy and hadn’t wanted to be rejected.\
      \ The counselor and Linda role-played this act of sharing during a \ncounseling\
      \ session. The counselor reminded Linda that it was okay to feel afraid and\
      \ reassured her that, if she \ncouldn’t share at the next meeting, they would\
      \ talk about what had stopped her.  \nAfter the next meeting, Linda related\
      \ that she almost shared but got scared at the last minute. She felt bad that\
      \ \nshe had missed an opportunity. She and the counselor talked about getting\
      \ it over with, and Linda resolved to \nreach out, starting her sharing statement\
      \ with, “It’s hard for me to talk in public, but I want to work this \nprogram,\
      \ so I’m telling you all that I know it’s time to get a sponsor.” This counseling\
      \ work helped Linda convey \nher need to the group. The response from group\
      \ members was helpful to Linda, as several women offered to \nmeet with her\
      \ and talk about sponsorship. This experience also helped Linda become more\
      \ attached to the \ngroup and learn a new skill for seeking help. Although Linda\
      \ was helped through counseling strategies alone, \nothers who are anxious in\
      \ social settings may need medications in addition to counseling."

      Similarly, it is essential for COD treatment providers to understand culturally\
      \ based concepts of and \nexpectations surrounding families. Providers should\
      \ learn each client’s role in the family and its cultural \nsignificance (e.g.,\
      \ expectations of the oldest son, a daughter’s responsibilities to her parents,\
      \ the role of \na grandmother as matriarch). \nProviders should not make assumptions\
      \ about clients based on their perception of the clients’ culture. \nAn individual\
      \ client’s level of acculturation and specific experiences may result in that\
      \ person identifying \nwith the dominant culture or other cultures. For example,\
      \ a person from India adopted by African \nAmerican parents at an early age\
      \ may know little about the cultural practices in his birth country. A \nprovider\
      \ working with this client would need to acknowledge the birth country and explore\
      \ the client’s \nassociations with it, as well as what those associations might\
      \ mean. The client’s country of origin may \nhave little influence on his cultural\
      \ beliefs or practices.  \nChapter 6 of this TIP further discusses culture-related\
      \ topics in COD treatment, including how \ncounselors can reduce racial/ethnic\
      \ disparities and use culturally adapted services. For more \ninformation about\
      \ cultural competence in general behavioral health services, see TIP 59, Improving\
      \ \nCultural Competence (SAMHSA, 2014a), which is available free of charge online\
      \ \n(https://store.samhsa.gov/system/files/sma14-4849.pdf).  \nUsing Motivational\
      \ Enhancement Consistent With Clients’ Specific Stage of Change \nMotivational\
      \ interviewing (MI) is a client-centered approach that enhances clients’ internal\
      \ \nmotivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence (Miller & Rollnick,\
      \ 2013). MI involves \naccepting a client’s level of motivation, whatever it\
      \ is, as the only possible starting point for change. For \nexample, if a client\
      \ says she has no interest in changing the amount or frequency of her drinking,\
      \ but is \ninterested in complying with an SUD interview to be eligible for\
      \ something else (such as the right to \nreturn to work or a housing voucher),\
      \ the SUD treatment provider would avoid arguing with or \nconfronting her.\
      \ Instead, the provider would focus on establishing a positive rapport with\
      \ the client—\neven remarking on the positive aspects of the client’s desire\
      \ to return to work or take care of herself by \nobtaining housing. The provider\
      \ would work with available openings to probe the areas in which the \nclient\
      \ does have motivation to change in hopes of eventually affecting the client’s\
      \ drinking or drug use. \nFor an indepth discussion of MI and how to apply its\
      \ principles to stages of change in clients with SUD, \nsee TIP 35, Enhancing\
      \ Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder Treatment (SAMHSA, 2019d).\
      \ \nGuiding Processes of MI \nFour overlapping processes guide the practice\
      \ of MI (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).  \n1. Engaging: The counselor uses strategies\
      \ to establish rapport and help build a trustful relationship \nwith the client.\
      \ Techniques include asking open- rather than close-ended questions, using reflective\
      \ \nlistening, summarizing statements from the client, and determining his or\
      \ her readiness to change.  \n2. Focusing: The counselor helps direct the conversation\
      \ and process as a whole through agenda \nsetting and identifying a target behavior\
      \ of change. \n3. Evoking: The counselor helps clients express their motivations\
      \ or reasons for change. Use of change \ntalk (expressing a desire to change)\
      \ is core to this process and helps clients recognize how their \nsubstance\
      \ use is affecting their lives. It helps clients recognize and respond to sustain\
      \ talk \n(expressing a desire not to change), which creates ambivalence and\
      \ should be minimized. Use of \nopen-ended questions and reflective listening\
      \ by the counselor will facilitate this process. \n4. Planning: The counselor\
      \ collaborates with the client to develop a plan for change. The plan is critical\
      \ \nfor putting ideas about and reasons for change into action. The counselor\
      \ works with clients to"

      identify a specific change goal (like reducing the number of drinks per day),\
      \ explore possible \nstrategies that will lead to the change, create steps to\
      \ make the change, and problem-solve possible \nobstacles to achieving lasting\
      \ behavior change. \nThe details of these strategies and techniques are presented\
      \ in TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change \nin Substance Use Disorder Treatment\
      \ (SAMHSA, 2019d) and in Miller and Rollnick’s manual, Motivational \nInterviewing:\
      \ Helping People Change (2013). \nMatching Motivational Strategies to Clients’\
      \ Stage of Change \nThe motivational strategies providers use should be consistent\
      \ with their clients’ stage of change (i.e., \nprecontemplation, contemplation,\
      \ preparation, action, maintenance, termination). A client with CODs \ncould\
      \ be at one stage of recovery or change for his or her mental disorder and another\
      \ for his or her \nSUD, which can complicate selection of strategies. Furthermore,\
      \ a client may be at one stage of change \nfor one substance and another stage\
      \ of change for another substance. For example, a client who has \ncombined\
      \ alcohol and cocaine use disorders with co-occurring panic disorder may be\
      \ in the \ncontemplation stage (i.e., aware that a problem exists and considering\
      \ overcoming it, but not \ncommitted to taking action) in regard to alcohol\
      \ use, precontemplation (i.e., unaware that a problem \nexists, with no intention\
      \ of changing behavior) in regard to cocaine use, and action (i.e., actively\
      \ \nmodifying behavior, experiences, or environment to overcome the problem)\
      \ for the panic disorder.  \nEvaluating clients’ motivational state is an ongoing\
      \ process. Court mandates, rules for clients engaged \nin group therapy, the\
      \ treatment agency’s operating restrictions, and other factors may act as barriers\
      \ to \nimplementing specific MI strategies in particular situations. \nMI and\
      \ CODs \nMI has been shown to be effective or efficacious in improving behavior\
      \ change—such as treatment \nengagement, attendance, and resistance—as well\
      \ as enhancing motivation and confidence in people \nwith mental or substance\
      \ misuse problems, including comorbid conditions (Baker, Thornton, Hiles, \n\
      Hides, & Lubman, 2012; Keeley et al., 2016; Laakso, 2012; Romano & Peters, 2015).\
      \ MI also appears to \nbe effective in helping clients with SUD reduce substance\
      \ misuse and associated behaviors and \nconsequences (DiClemente, Corno, Graydon,\
      \ Wiprovnick, & Knoblach, 2017). For instance, a review of \nstudies on COD\
      \ interventions for people involved in the criminal justice system found MI\
      \ helpful in \nreducing self-reported substance misuse (Perry et al., 2015).\
      \ In a sample of people with PTSD seeking \nSUD treatment (Coffey et al., 2016),\
      \ trauma-focused motivational enhancement therapy was associated \nwith significantly\
      \ greater reductions in PTSD symptoms versus a control condition (12 sessions\
      \ of healthy \nlifestyle education). At 6 months after treatment, just 6 percent\
      \ of participants in the motivational \nenhancement therapy group had a positive\
      \ urine drug screen for at least 1 illicit substance, compared \nwith almost\
      \ 13 percent in the healthy lifestyle control group. \nMotivational strategies\
      \ may be helpful with people who have SMI, but more research is needed. A 3-\n\
      week MI intervention yielded improvements in medication adherence, self-efficacy,\
      \ and motivation to \nchange among clients receiving outpatient treatment for\
      \ bipolar disorder (McKenzie & Chang, 2015). \nResults concerning MI and improved\
      \ adherence to pharmacotherapy for clients with schizophrenia are \ngenerally\
      \ negative, but some research suggests that MI reduces psychotic symptoms and\
      \ hospitalization \nrates (Vanderwaal, 2015). A meta-analysis of MI plus cognitive–behavioral\
      \ therapy (CBT) as an adjunct \nto or replacement for treatment as usual for\
      \ co-occurring AUD and depression (Riper et al., 2014) found \nsmall but positive\
      \ effects in decreasing alcohol consumption and improving depressive symptoms."

      Although more research is warranted, it appears that MI strategies may be applied\
      \ successfully to the \ntreatment of clients with CODs, especially in: \n• \n\
      Assessing clients’ perceptions of their problems. \n• \nExploring clients’ understanding\
      \ of their disorders. \n• \nExamining clients’ desire for continued treatment.\
      \ \n• \nEnsuring client attendance at initial sessions. \n• \nExpanding clients’\
      \ willingness to take responsibility for change. \nTeaching Relapse Prevention\
      \ Techniques \nSAMHSA (2011) considers relapse prevention a critical component\
      \ of integrated programming for \neffective COD treatment. The long-term course\
      \ of comorbid mental illness and addiction is often marked \nby (sometimes multiple)\
      \ instances of relapse and remission (Luciano, Bryan, et al., 2014; Xie, Drake,\
      \ \nMcHugo, Xie, & Mohandas, 2010). Per the National Institute on Drug Abuse\
      \ (NIDA), relapse is “a return \nto drug use after an attempt to stop” (NIDA,\
      \ 2018c). Others define relapse as “a setback that occurs \nduring the behavior\
      \ change process, such that progress toward the initiation or maintenance of\
      \ a \nbehavior change goal (e.g., abstinence from drug use) is interrupted by\
      \ a reversion to the target \nbehavior” (Hendershot, Witkiewitz, George, & Marlatt,\
      \ 2011, p. 2).  \nA variety of SUD relapse prevention models are described in\
      \ the literature (Hendershot et al., 2011; \nMelemis, 2015). However, all relapse\
      \ prevention approaches include anticipating problems likely to \narise in maintaining\
      \ change, acknowledging them as high-risk situations for resumed substance use,\
      \ \nand helping clients develop strategies to cope with those situations without\
      \ having a lapse.  \nTo prevent relapse, providers and clients must understand\
      \ the types of triggers and cues that precede \nit. These warning signs precede\
      \ exposure to events, environments, or internal processes (high-risk \nsituations)\
      \ where or when resumed substance use is likely. A lapse may occur in response\
      \ to these high-\nrisk situations unless the client is able to implement effective\
      \ coping strategies quickly and adequately.  \nIn relapse prevention, providers\
      \ recognize that lapses (single episodes or brief returns to substance use)\
      \ are an \nexpected part of overcoming SUDs. Lapses do not signal failure or\
      \ loss of all treatment progress.  \nFor clients with CODs who require medication\
      \ to manage disruptive or disorganizing mental disorder \nsymptoms, it is critical\
      \ for providers to address lapses in medication regimen adherence. In these\
      \ \ncases, a “lapse” is defined as not taking prescribed medication. This type\
      \ of lapse is different from lapses \nthat involve returns to substance misuse\
      \ for self-medication or pleasure seeking. \nCounseling for relapse prevention\
      \ can occur individually or in small groups, and may include practice or \n\
      role-play to help clients learn how to cope effectively with high-risk situations.\
      \ Relapse prevention \napproaches have many common elements (Daley & Marlatt,\
      \ 1992) that highlight the need for clients to: \n1. Have a range of cognitive\
      \ and behavioral coping strategies to handle high-risk situations and relapse\
      \ \nwarning signs. \n2. Make lifestyle changes that decrease the need for alcohol,\
      \ drugs, or tobacco. \n3. Increase healthy activities. \n4. Be prepared to interrupt\
      \ lapses so that they do not end in full-blown relapse. \n5. Resume or continue\
      \ to practice relapse prevention skills even when a full-blown relapse does\
      \ occur \nby renewing their commitment to abstinence rather than giving up the\
      \ goal of living a drug-free life."

      NIDA (2018) includes relapse prevention therapy (RPT) in its list of effective\
      \ SUD treatment \napproaches. RPT helps people maintain health behavior changes\
      \ by teaching them to anticipate and \ncope with relapse. There are five categories\
      \ of RPT strategies (Marlatt, 1985):  \n• \nAssessment procedures help clients\
      \ appreciate the nature of their problems in objective terms, to \nmeasure motivation\
      \ for change, and to identify risk factors that increase the probability of\
      \ relapse. \n• \nInsight/awareness-raising techniques help clients adjust their\
      \ beliefs about the behavior change \nprocess (e.g., viewing it as a learning\
      \ process). Via self-monitoring, RPT also helps clients identify \npatterns\
      \ of emotion, thought, and behavior related to SUDs and co-occurring mental\
      \ disorders. \n• \nCoping-skills training strategies teach clients behavioral\
      \ and cognitive strategies to avoid relapse. \n• \nCognitive strategies help\
      \ clients manage urges and craving, identify early warning signals of relapse,\
      \ \nand reframe reactions to an initial lapse. \n• \nLifestyle modifications\
      \ (e.g., meditation, exercise) strengthen clients’ overall coping capacity.\
      \ \nThe goal of RPT is to teach clients to recognize increasing relapse risk\
      \ and to intervene at earlier points \nin the relapse process. Thus, RPT fosters\
      \ client progress toward maintaining abstinence and living a life \nin which\
      \ lapses occur less often and are less severe. RPT frames a lapse as a “fork\
      \ in the road,” or a \ncrisis. Each lapse has elements of danger (progression\
      \ to full-blown relapse) and opportunity (reduced \nrelapse risk in the future\
      \ because of the lessons learned from debriefing the lapse).  \nRPT encourages\
      \ clients to create a balanced lifestyle that will help them manage their CODs\
      \ more \neffectively and fulfill their needs without using substances to cope\
      \ with life’s demands and \nopportunities. In delivering RPT, providers can:\
      \ \n• \nExplore with clients the positive and negative consequences of continued\
      \ substance use (“decisional \nbalance,” as discussed in the motivational interviewing\
      \ section of this chapter). \n• \nHelp clients recognize high-risk situations\
      \ for returning to substance use. \n• \nTeach clients skills to avoid high-risk\
      \ situations or cope effectively with them. \n• \nDevelop a relapse emergency\
      \ plan for damage control to limit lapse duration/severity. \n• \nSupport clients\
      \ in learning how to identify and cope with substance-related urges and cravings.\
      \ \nAdvice to the Counselor: Using Relapse Prevention Methods in COD Treatment\
      \ \nThe consensus panel recommends using the following relapse prevention methods\
      \ with clients who have CODs:  \n• Provide relapse prevention education on both\
      \ mental disorders and SUDs and their interrelations.  \n• Teach clients skills\
      \ to resist pressure to stop psychotropic medication and to increase medication\
      \ adherence.  \n• Encourage attendance at dual recovery groups and teach social\
      \ skills necessary for participation.  \n• Use daily inventory to monitor psychiatric\
      \ symptoms and symptoms changes.  \nIf relapse occurs, use it as a learning\
      \ experience to investigate triggers with the client. Reframe the relapse as\
      \ an \nopportunity for self-knowledge and a step toward ultimate success. \n\
      Empirical Evidence Supporting Use of RPT in COD Treatment \nMuch of the empirical\
      \ literature on RPT addresses its application in SUD treatment. In this context,\
      \ RPT \nhas demonstrated strong and consistent efficacy versus no treatment\
      \ and similar efficacy to other active \ntreatments on outcomes like reduced\
      \ relapse risk and severity, increased treatment gains, and greater \nuse of\
      \ treatment matching (Bowen et al., 2014; Hendershot et al., 2011). Research\
      \ also supports RPT \nfor enhancing substance use outcomes among people with\
      \ CODs."

      \ prolonged exposure therapy is linked to marked improvement in client- and\
      \ provider-reported SUD \nand PTSD symptom severity and past-week substance\
      \ use (Ruglass et al., 2017). \nRPT Adaptations for Clients With CODs \nRPT\
      \ adaptations for clients with CODs should address their full range of symptoms\
      \ and circumstances. \nAdapted RPT should support adherence to treatment (including\
      \ medication adherence—particularly \ncritical for people with psychotic or\
      \ bipolar disorders), improve social functioning, and help clients meet \nbasic\
      \ living needs (e.g., finding housing, gaining stable employment). The aspects\
      \ of RPT most useful for \nimproving recovery from CODs (Subodh, Sharma, & Shah,\
      \ 2018; Weiss & Connery, 2011) include: \n• \nEncouraging abstinence. \n• \n\
      Promoting adherence to mood-stabilizing medication. \n• \nSupporting habits\
      \ associated with stable mood, like good sleep hygiene. \n• \nPromoting recovery\
      \ by teaching clients strategies for: \n− Avoiding, recognizing, and responding\
      \ to high-risk situations that are likely to exacerbate \nsubstance- or mood-related\
      \ symptoms and problems. \n− Using substance-refusal skills.  \n• \nAddressing\
      \ multiple areas of functioning, including interpersonal functioning. \n• \n\
      Using family-focused interventions, especially for clients who have demonstrated\
      \ difficulty with \nadhering to treatment/medication or who have problems with\
      \ cognition or insight. \n• \nFacilitating engagement in mutual support groups.\
      \ \nIn a small qualitative analysis of men with CODs (Luciano, Bryan, et al.,\
      \ 2014), client-reported relapse \nprevention strategies deemed helpful for\
      \ maintaining at least 1 year of sobriety included: \n• \nBuilding a supportive\
      \ community, including peers in treatment. \n• \nEstablishing a meaningful daily\
      \ routine (e.g., going to work, attending school, exercising). \n• \nAdopting\
      \ a healthy mindset that helped individuals stay mindful of cravings and other\
      \ symptoms, \ndevelop insight about the relationship between substance use and\
      \ mental illness, and maintain a \nsense of responsibility (to themselves and\
      \ to others) to live a life of recovery. \nRPT-based SUD interventions with\
      \ integrated components to address PTSD are supported by a \ngrowing number\
      \ of studies, reflecting the field’s recognition that trauma commonly co-occurs\
      \ with \naddiction (Swopes, Davis, & Scholl, 2017; Vrana, Killeen, Brant, Mastrogiovanni,\
      \ & Baker, 2017; \nVujanovic, Smith, Green, Lane, & Schmitz, 2018). In just\
      \ one example of trauma-informed RPT \nadaptations to address CODs, Vallejo\
      \ and Amaro (2009) adapted a mindfulness-based stress reduction \nprogram for\
      \ relapse prevention among women with SUDs and trauma/PTSD to better address\
      \ trauma \nsensitivity and risk of relapse. Modifications included:  \n• \n\
      Centrally focusing on stress management as a key skill in preventing relapse.\
      \ \n• \nUsing shorter and more structured sessions. \n• \nAltering body scan\
      \ activities to reduce anxiety and promote feelings of safety (e.g., having\
      \ \nparticipants perform body scan exercises with eyes open rather than closed;\
      \ avoiding a detailed \nfocus on scanning parts of the body that could be triggering\
      \ or retraumatizing, like the pelvic area). \n• \nUsing a more flexible curriculum\
      \ that emphasized early identification of warning signs of relapse."

      • \nHaving counselors available to work with clients on uncomfortable feelings\
      \ that arose in sessions. \nPTSD-related adaptations may be particularly important\
      \ when providing RPT for women, in whom \ntrauma-related symptoms have been\
      \ shown to predict returns to substance use (Heffner, Blom, & \nAnthenelli,\
      \ 2011). \nIntegrated Treatment \nRPT and other CBT approaches to mental health\
      \ counseling and SUD treatment allow providers to treat \nCODs in an integrated\
      \ way by: \n1. Conducting a detailed functional analysis of the relationships\
      \ between substance use, mental \ndisorder symptoms, and any reported criminal\
      \ conduct. \n2. Evaluating unique and common high-risk factors for each problem\
      \ and gauging how they interrelate. \n3. Assessing cognitive and behavioral\
      \ coping skills deficits. \n4. Implementing cognitive and behavioral coping\
      \ skills training tailored to the specific needs of each \nclient with respect\
      \ to substance use, symptoms of mental disorder, and criminal conduct. \nChapter\
      \ 7 further discusses integrated treatments and their outcomes for clients with\
      \ CODs. \nUse Repetition and Skill Building To Address Deficits in Functioning\
      \ \nIn applying the approaches described previously, providers should keep in\
      \ mind that clients with CODs \noften have cognitive limitations, including\
      \ difficulty concentrating. Sometimes, these limitations are \ntransient and\
      \ improve during the first several weeks of treatment. Other times, symptoms\
      \ persist for \nlong periods. In some cases, individuals with specific disorders\
      \ (e.g., schizophrenia, attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder) may manifest\
      \ these symptoms as part of their disorder. \nGeneral treatment strategies to\
      \ address cognitive limitations in clients with CODs include:  \n• \nBeing more\
      \ concrete and less abstract in communicating ideas. \n• \nUsing simpler concepts.\
      \ \n• \nHaving briefer discussions. \n• \nRepeating core concepts many times.\
      \  \n• \nPresenting information in multiple formats (verbally; visually; affectively\
      \ through stories, music, and \nexperiential activities).  \n• \nUsing role-playing\
      \ to practice real-life situations with clients who have cognitive limitations\
      \ (e.g., \nhaving a client practice “asking for help” by phone using a prepared\
      \ script individually with the \ncounselor, or in a group to obtain feedback\
      \ from the members). \nCompared with individuals who have no additional disorders\
      \ or disabilities, people with CODs and \nadditional deficits require more SUD\
      \ treatment to attain and maintain abstinence. Abstinence requires \nclients\
      \ to develop and use a set of SUD recovery skills. Clients with co-occurring\
      \ mental disorders face \nadditional challenges that require learning yet more\
      \ diverse skills. They also may require more support \nthat provides treatment\
      \ in smaller steps with more practice, rehearsal, and repetition. The challenge\
      \ is \nnot to provide more intensive or complicated treatment for clients with\
      \ CODs, but rather to tailor the \nskill acquisition process to the needs and\
      \ abilities of each client. \nCase Study: Using Repetition and Skills Building\
      \ With a Client Who Has CODs"

      In individual counseling sessions with Susan, a 34-year-old White woman with\
      \ bipolar disorder and AUD, the \ncounselor observes that she frequently forgets\
      \ details of her recent past, including discussions and decisions \nmade in\
      \ recent counseling sessions. Conclusions the counselor thought were clear in\
      \ one session seem fuzzy by \nthe next. The counselor adjusts course, starting\
      \ sessions with a brief review of the last session. The counselor \nallows time\
      \ at the end of each session for a review. Susan has difficulty remembering\
      \ appointment times and \nother responsibilities, so the counselor also helps\
      \ her devise a system of reminders. \nGuidance for Working With Clients Who\
      \ Have Specific Co-\nOccurring Mental Disorders \nClients with certain mental\
      \ disorders may have specific treatment needs and do best with particular \n\
      counseling approaches tailored to their diagnosis and levels of functioning.\
      \ This is especially true for \nmental disorders known to be highly disabling,\
      \ distressing, longstanding, or difficult to treat—such as \ndepression, anxiety,\
      \ PTSD, and SMI. These mental disorders are also the most likely to co-occur\
      \ with \nsubstance misuse. This section of Chapter 5 offers guidance for SUD\
      \ treatment, mental health service, \nand other providers on how best to deliver\
      \ SUD treatment and build rapport with clients who have \nthese disorders. Chapter\
      \ 4 covers diagnosis and management of the specific mental disorders discussed.\
      \ \nMDD \nDepression commonly co-occurs with SUDs (Lai et al., 2015), and each\
      \ can exacerbate the other. To \noptimize treatment outcomes, counselors working\
      \ with clients who have an SUD and MDD should:  \n• \nUse integrated CBT treatment\
      \ approaches. Review studies and meta-analyses confirm CBT’s \neffectiveness\
      \ in improving symptoms and decreasing substance misuse among people with \n\
      depression and SUDs, particularly when integrated with additional treatment\
      \ strategies such as RPT \nor MI (Baker et al., 2012; Riper et al., 2014; Vujanovic\
      \ et al., 2017). CBT treatment elements most \nhelpful for clients with depression\
      \ and SUDs include (Vujanovic et al., 2017): \n− Functional analysis of situations\
      \ in which substance use is likely to occur and of situations \nassociated with\
      \ depressive symptoms. \n− Cognitive training to identify and reframe maladaptive\
      \ thoughts associated with increased \nsubstance use as well as with negative\
      \ mood. \n− Behavioral skills to address craving, coping with stressful situations,\
      \ and improving mood. \n• \nIncorporate behavioral activation (BA) techniques\
      \ into CBT treatment. BA techniques are often \nused in CBT to help clients\
      \ improve their mood by reengaging in pleasant and rewarding behaviors. \nBA\
      \ supports clients in identifying rewarding activities and goals, barriers to\
      \ engaging in those \nactivities (e.g., avoidance triggers), and solutions for\
      \ reducing avoidance. Research on BA for \ndepression and SUDs is still growing,\
      \ but early evidence suggests that CBT with BA is feasible and \nefficacious\
      \ in reducing negative mood, increasing activation of pleasant behaviors, and\
      \ improving \ntreatment retention (Daughters, Magidson, Lejuez, & Chen, 2016;\
      \ Martínez-Vispo, Martínez, López-\nDurán, Fernández del Río, & Becoña, 2018;\
      \ Vujanovic et al., 2017). \n• \nRemain vigilant for double depression. Not\
      \ all clients with depression and SUDs will meet criteria \nfor MDD, but they\
      \ may still have distressing, impairing depressive symptoms that would benefit\
      \ \nfrom treatment. It is important that counselors look for clients with “double\
      \ depression,” or the \noccurrence of persistent depressive disorder and intermittent\
      \ major depressive episodes. In a \nsample of clients seeking SUD treatment,\
      \ 14 percent had double depression (Diaz, Horton, &"

      Weiner, 2012) and reported higher levels of alcohol dependence and lower quality\
      \ of life than \nparticipants with dysthymia only or MDD only. \n• \nPerform\
      \ (or give referrals for) medication evaluations. Antidepressants can be highly\
      \ effective in \ntreating MDD, but not all clients will need medication. Evaluation\
      \ by a psychiatrist can help \ndetermine whether pharmacotherapy is warranted.\
      \ \n• \nBe mindful of the unclear temporal relationship between depression and\
      \ substance misuse, as \nthis can affect treatment planning. Providers may be\
      \ tempted to assume that a client is misusing \nsubstances to self-medicate\
      \ for depression or that a client’s depression is substance induced. But \n\
      the relationship between substance misuse and depression is multifactorial,\
      \ with more research \nneeded to clarify those factors. Although there is some\
      \ support for the self-medication hypothesis, \nseveral factors affect the temporal-causal\
      \ relationship between depression and substance misuse, \nlike sociocultural\
      \ factors (e.g., income-to-poverty ratio) and demographics (Lo, Cheng, & de\
      \ la Rosa, \n2015). Counselors should not make treatment decisions based on\
      \ assumptions that alleviating \ndepressive symptoms will reduce substance misuse\
      \ or vice versa. CODs tend to be intertwined in \ncomplex ways and often require\
      \ multiple trials of various approaches to treatment. \nAnxiety Disorders \n\
      Despite high rates of elevated anxiety among SUD populations, research on the\
      \ complex relationship \nbetween substance misuse and anxiety is still developing.\
      \ The emerging picture suggests that anxiety \ncan be a risk for substance misuse\
      \ (such as through avoidance coping or self-medication) and that \nsubstance\
      \ use, craving, and withdrawal can lead to increases in anxiety.  \nCounselors\
      \ treating clients for anxiety disorders and SUDs should be mindful that: \n\
      • \nAnxiety needs to be assessed early in treatment. Anxiety is related to more\
      \ severe substance \ndependence and is associated with higher rates of treatment\
      \ dropout and posttreatment relapse \n(McHugh, 2015; Smith & Randall, 2012;\
      \ Vorspan, Mehtelli, Dupuy, Bloch, & Lépine, 2015). \nIdentifying clients with\
      \ elevated anxiety early in SUD treatment could help providers better address\
      \ \nrisks for premature treatment termination or posttreatment relapse. Screening\
      \ for elevated anxiety \nearly in treatment can also identify clients who may\
      \ require additional skills to help them manage \nelevated distress related\
      \ to stopping or decreasing their substance use (e.g., distress associated with\
      \ \nwithdrawal; worsening of anxiety symptoms previously self-managed with drugs\
      \ or alcohol). \n• \nThe type of anxiety disorder can affect treatment engagement,\
      \ participation, and retention. For \ninstance, individuals with elevated social\
      \ anxiety may be reluctant to speak during group treatment \nor to share their\
      \ social worries with their counselors for fear of being judged or ridiculed.\
      \ This can \nimpede their ability to participate in and benefit from group or\
      \ even individual SUD treatments. \nCounselors should discuss with anxious clients\
      \ their reasons for treatment noncompliance when \nrelevant. Sometimes, anxious\
      \ clients have difficulty adhering to treatment because of their \nsymptoms\
      \ or anxiety-related avoidance, not because of low motivation. \n• \nAnxiety\
      \ symptoms can mimic or occur as a part of withdrawal from substances:  \n−\
      \ Anxiety is a commonly reported withdrawal symptom (Craske & Stein, 2016).\
      \ When clients \nreduce or stop using substances, their anxiety may increase\
      \ as a result of withdrawal.  \n− Anxiety sensitivity (fear of anxiety-related\
      \ sensations) is related to premature treatment \ntermination (Belleau et al.,\
      \ 2017), in part because clients with this sensitivity face additional \ndifficulty\
      \ tolerating physical symptoms of withdrawal. People may misinterpret physical\
      \ \nsymptoms of withdrawal (e.g., increased heart rate, sweating, sleep problems,\
      \ irritability) as signs"

      of a medical problem. Anxiety symptoms and anxiety sensitivity can also evolve\
      \ into full-blown \nanxiety disorders if left untreated, making clients vulnerable\
      \ for returns to substance use. \n• \nIntegrated treatments are highly recommended:\
      \ \n− Given the worse outcomes associated with treating anxiety and SUDs in\
      \ isolation, clients may \nbenefit from an integrated approach. Given the bidirectional\
      \ relationship between the two \nconditions, addressing both simultaneously\
      \ in integrated counseling can mitigate relapse and \nprovide a holistic approach\
      \ to treatment. \n− Effective techniques include psychoeducation about the nature\
      \ of anxiety (e.g., the relationship \nbetween thoughts, feelings, and behaviors;\
      \ normalizing anxiety), CBT (including anxiety \nmonitoring, thought restructuring,\
      \ clarifying cognitive distortions, exposure therapy, and \nrelaxation training),\
      \ medication, motivational enhancement, mindfulness, and encouraging a \nhealthy\
      \ lifestyle (e.g., good sleep hygiene, engaging in physical activity). \nPTSD\
      \ \nPeople with PTSD or histories of trauma are susceptible to substance misuse,\
      \ often as a coping \nmechanism. People with both PTSD and SUDs tend to have\
      \ worse clinical symptoms than people with \neither disorder alone, including\
      \ a higher risk of suicide (SAMHSA, 2014b). Providers whose clients have \n\
      PTSD and SUDs can improve treatment success if they: \n• \nTreat disorders concurrently.\
      \ Integrated, concurrent treatments are effective; clients may prefer \nthem\
      \ over sequential treatment (Banerjee & Spry, 2017; Flanagan et al., 2016; SAMHSA,\
      \ 2014b). \nAdditionally, some symptoms of PTSD may worsen during abstinence.\
      \ Do not make the mistake of \nthinking that treating the SUD will necessarily\
      \ alleviate the PTSD. Both must be treated jointly. In \nsome instances, medication\
      \ for PTSD may also be needed. \n• \nHelp clients increase their feelings of\
      \ safety at the outset of treatment through techniques such as \ngrounding exercises,\
      \ establishing routines in treatment, discussing safety-promoting behaviors,\
      \ and \ndeveloping a safety plan to help the client feel confident, prepared,\
      \ and in control (SAMHSA, 2014b). \n• \nTake steps to help prevent retraumatization\
      \ of clients. This includes being sensitive to clients’ \ntriggers (e.g., allowing\
      \ a client to sit facing the door instead of with his or her back to it); sensitively\
      \ \naddressing clients acting out in response to triggering events; listening\
      \ for cues that cause reactions \nand behaviors; and teaching clients to identify\
      \ and manage trauma-related triggers (SAMHSA, \n2014b). \n• \nAdjust the pace,\
      \ timing, and length of sessions to the needs of clients. Do not rush clients\
      \ into \ntalking about their trauma, and stay alert for signs of clients feeling\
      \ overwhelmed by the intensity or \nspeed of the intervention (SAMHSA, 2014b).\
      \ Creating safety and enhancing coping skills to manage \ntraumatic stress reactions\
      \ are key aspects of helping clients heal from trauma. \n• \nRecognize the cyclical\
      \ relationship between trauma and substance use. Using substances places \n\
      people at greater risk for additional traumatic events. These traumas increase\
      \ risks of substance \nmisuse. Counselors need to educate clients about this\
      \ to help safeguard them from harm. \nChapter 4 provides more information about\
      \ trauma-informed care for people with CODs. \nSMI \nPeople with SMI and SUDs\
      \ often have complex recovery trajectories with drastic shifts in symptoms and\
      \ \nfunctioning, employment, housing, family life, social relationships, and\
      \ physical health. Counselors \nworking with clients who have SMI and SUDs should\
      \ be aware that:"

      • \nAlthough integrated treatments work for many clients with SMI and SUDs,\
      \ there are different \nlevels of success with this approach. Integrated treatment\
      \ for SMI and SUDs has demonstrated \nmixed results in the empirical literature\
      \ (Chow et al., 2013; Hunt, Siegfried, Morley, Sitharthan, & \nCleary, 2013).\
      \ It may help improve psychiatric symptoms better than nonintegrated treatment\
      \ in \noutpatient and residential settings and may be better at reducing alcohol\
      \ consumption, but not drug \nuse, in residential settings compared with outpatient\
      \ settings. However, some studies have found \nno significant effects of integrated\
      \ versus nonintegrated treatments. For some clients with SMI and \nSUDs, parallel\
      \ treatment may be preferable and should not be ruled out as an option after\
      \ first \ntrying to treat concurrently. \n• \nMany SMI symptoms, like psychosis,\
      \ apathy, and cognitive dysfunction, can undermine treatment \nparticipation\
      \ and adherence. Treatment should address (Horsfall, Cleary, Hunt, & Walter,\
      \ 2009):  \n− Managing positive and negative symptoms of psychosis. \n− Increasing\
      \ coping skills. \n− Improving social skills, including communication with others.\
      \ \n− Enhancing problem-solving abilities. \n− Building distress tolerance.\
      \  \n− Increasing motivation. \n− Learning how to set and achieve goals. \n\
      − Expanding social support networks (include peer supports). \nGiven these potential\
      \ cognitive, social, and functional challenges, counselors may need to use \n\
      sessions that are shorter, more flexible, adapted to client impairments, and\
      \ lower in intensity. \n• \nSMI often requires medication for symptom stabilization.\
      \ Counselors should consider referring \nclients not currently on medication\
      \ or not being followed by a psychiatrist for a medication \nevaluation, especially\
      \ for clients who are unstable or experiencing positive psychiatric symptoms\
      \ \n(e.g., hallucinations, delusions). \n• \nClients may need assistance with\
      \ basic living needs. Securing reliable housing and gainful \nemployment are\
      \ often among the greatest stressors people with SMI experience (Horsfall et\
      \ al., \n2009). Vocational rehabilitation and housing assistance should be provided\
      \ as a part of \ncomprehensive COD care to help increase the chances of long-term\
      \ recovery. Certain clients may \nalso need help from counselors in liaising\
      \ with the criminal justice system. \n• \nEncouraging abstinence may indirectly\
      \ help improve psychiatric symptoms. Stopping substance \nuse can give clients\
      \ a sense of accomplishment and self-efficacy that can fuel their confidence\
      \ in \nbeing able to recover from their mental illness as well (Green, Yarborough,\
      \ et al., 2015).  \nConclusion \nTherapeutic alliance is a critical component\
      \ of counseling essential to clients’ success and long-term \nrecovery. People\
      \ with CODs often face numerous difficulties in managing complex and fluctuating\
      \ \nsymptoms as well as the effects of symptoms on everyday living, including\
      \ their ability to function as a \nproductive and healthy member of society,\
      \ hold down a job, maintain housing, and have fulfilling \nrelationships. Experiences\
      \ of stigma and feelings of hopelessness can contribute to clients’ mistrust\
      \ or \nlow motivation to initiate, engage in, and complete treatment.  \nProviders\
      \ working with people who have CODs should be aware of basic approaches that\
      \ can support \nthe therapeutic relationship and make interventions more effective.\

      \ Disorders Among Special \nPopulations  \n(For Counselors, Other Treatment/Service\
      \ Providers, \nSupervisors, and Administrators) \nKey Messages \nThe recovery\
      \ community is diverse. Assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of substance use\
      \ disorders (SUDs), \nmental disorders, or both (co-occurring disorders [CODs])\
      \ should be inclusive of all people who need services. \nPeople experiencing\
      \ homelessness, those involved in the criminal justice system, women, and people\
      \ who \nidentify with diverse racial/ethnic groups have historically been underserved,\
      \ often have unique needs and \npresenting symptoms, and face certain barriers\
      \ to care (and thus to recovery) that counselors can help address. \nCounselors\
      \ may need to adapt treatment approaches to ensure the most beneficial COD outcomes\
      \ for these \ngroups. Adaptations are possible across a wide spectrum, involving\
      \ basic to increasingly complex modifications. \nRegardless of complexity, all\
      \ population-specific adaptations should aim to improve the therapeutic alliance,\
      \ \nincrease clients’ engagement in services, and give people with CODs the\
      \ best chances for long-term recovery.  \nThere are ample resources available\
      \ to help counselors tailor SUD treatment and mental health services to the\
      \ \nneeds of special populations with CODs. \nSome people with CODs are especially\
      \ vulnerable to treatment challenges and poor outcomes—namely, \nwomen, people\
      \ from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, people experiencing homelessness,\
      \ and people \ninvolved in the criminal justice system. This chapter describes\
      \ proven and emerging COD treatment \nstrategies that can effectively address\
      \ substance misuse in these populations. It describes unique \naspects of CODs\
      \ among specific populations and offers recommendations of use to SUD treatment\
      \ \nproviders, other behavioral health service providers, program supervisors/administrators,\
      \ and primary \ncare providers who may encounter clients with CODs in their\
      \ practice. \nA complete description of the demographic, sociocultural, and\
      \ other aspects of the noted populations \nand related treatment programs and\
      \ models is beyond the scope of this Treatment Improvement \nProtocol (TIP).\
      \ However, readers can find more detailed information about population-specific\
      \ \nbehavioral health services in other TIPs, including:  \n• \nTIP 44, Substance\
      \ Abuse Treatment for Adults in the Criminal Justice System (Center for Substance\
      \ \nAbuse Treatment, 2005b). \n• \nTIP 51, Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing\

      \ Cultural Competence (SAMHSA, 2014a). \nMilitary Personnel \nActive duty military\
      \ members and veterans are a unique, complex population at risk for CODs, trauma,\
      \ \nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal ideation. They often\
      \ lack access to sufficient behavioral health"

      \ surrounding \nstigma toward mental illness) and circumstances, such as deployments\
      \ and family stress, to provide behavioral \nhealth services that are responsive\
      \ to this population’s needs. See the “Trauma” section in Chapter 4 for more\
      \ \ninformation on military personnel. Chapter 4 also lists resources that address\
      \ some of the specific behavioral \nhealth needs of the military population\
      \ and how counselors can best meet those needs. \nPeople Experiencing Homelessness\
      \ \nHomelessness continues to be one of the United States’ most intractable\
      \ and complex social problems, \nalthough homelessness affects only about 0.2\
      \ percent of the U.S. population (Willison, 2017). The \nDepartment of Housing\
      \ and Urban Development (Henry et al., 2018) reported that \napproximately553,000\
      \ people experienced homelessness in the United States on any given night in\
      \ \n2018. Moreover, the prevalence of homelessness is rising. From 2017 to 2018,\
      \ the number of individuals \nexperiencing homelessness rose by 0.3 percent\
      \ and the number living in unsheltered locations increased \nby 3 percent; the\
      \ number experiencing chronic homelessness increased by 2 percent (Henry et\
      \ al., \n2018).  \nAmong more than 36,000 U.S. adults who participated in the\
      \ 2012–2013 Wave 3 of the National \nEpidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related\
      \ Conditions (Tsai, 2018), lifetime homelessness was about 4 \npercent and past-year\
      \ homelessness was 1.5 percent. Risk of homelessness was associated with a \n\
      history of mental illness (including serious mental illness [SMI]), lifetime\
      \ tobacco use, and lifetime \nsuicide attempt, among other demographic and social\
      \ variables (Tsai, 2018).  \nHomelessness, Mental Health, and Substance Misuse\
      \ \nThe prevalence of substance misuse and mental illness among people experiencing\
      \ homelessness is \nhigh. Solari, Morris, Shivji, and Souza (2016) found that\
      \ about 33 percent of adults in permanent \nsupportive housing programs had\
      \ a mental disorder; 8 percent, substance abuse (per Diagnostic and \nStatistical\
      \ Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV] criteria); and 25 percent,\
      \ CODs. Further \nstatistics paint a similar picture: \n• \nStringfellow et\
      \ al. (2016) reported that 3-month substance use among individuals experiencing\
      \ \nhomelessness was 50 percent for alcohol, 19 percent for cannabis, 16 percent\
      \ for cocaine, 7.5 \npercent for opioids, and 6.5 percent for sedatives. Furthermore,\
      \ 59 percent of individuals who took \nthe Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement\
      \ Screening Test had moderate or high risk for \nsubstance misuse.  \n• \nIn\
      \ a study of more than 870,000 veterans with SMI, 7 percent experienced homelessness\
      \ (Hermes & \nRosenheck, 2016). \n• \nAmong a sample of women experiencing homelessness\
      \ who were seeking treatment in primary care \nsettings (Upshur, Jenkins, Weinreb,\
      \ Gelberg, & Orvek, 2017), self-reported rates of SUDs or mental \ndisorders\
      \ greatly exceeded those in the general population. Specifically, women reported\
      \ rates \nhigher than the general population for: \n− SMI (4 times higher).\
      \ \n− Major depressive disorder (MDD; 5 times higher). \n− Alcohol use disorder\
      \ (AUD; 4 times higher). \n− Any drug use disorder (12 times higher). \n• \n\
      A study of people ages 50 and older experiencing homelessness (Spinelli et al.,\
      \ 2017) found that:  \n− 38 percent had current symptoms of MDD."

      \ \n− 10 percent reported binge drinking. \nPeople experiencing homelessness\
      \ often have CODs. In 2010, about 17 percent of adults enrolled in \npermanent\
      \ supportive housing programs had CODs; this increased to 22 percent in 2014\
      \ and 25 percent \nin 2015 (Solari et al., 2016). Among women experiencing homelessness\
      \ and seeking primary healthcare, \n26 percent reported at least one mental\
      \ disorder and one SUD (Upshur et al., 2017). In a sample of \nveterans experiencing\
      \ homelessness, 77 percent had at least one previous mental disorder diagnosis;\
      \ 47 \npercent, a substance-related diagnosis; and 37 percent, a COD diagnosis\
      \ (Ding, Slate, & Yang, 2017). \nThe Importance of Housing \nHousing is more\
      \ than just physical shelter. It is a social determinant of health and is essential\
      \ for \nindividual physical, emotional, and socioeconomic wellbeing. Housing\
      \ affects communities, \ngovernments, and nations through its impact on the\
      \ economy, healthcare system, workforce, and more.  \nHousing for veterans and\
      \ civilians with mental disorders, SUDs, or CODs is particularly important.\
      \ \nHomelessness in these populations is associated with negative treatment-system\
      \ factors, including  \n• \nIncreased emergency department (ED) usage (Cox,\
      \ Malte, & Saxon, 2017; Moulin, Evans, Xing, & \nMelnikow, 2018). \n• \nHigher\
      \ ED costs (Mitchell, Leon, Byrne, Lin, & Bharel, 2017). \n• \nGreater usage\
      \ of inpatient services (Cox et al., 2017). \n• \nHigher risk of incarceration/criminal\
      \ justice involvement (Cusack & Montgomery, 2017; Polcin, 2016). \nPeople experiencing\
      \ homelessness who screened at highest risk for an SUD had lower scores of social\
      \ \nsupport and higher scores of psychological distress compared with those\
      \ who screened at low or \nmoderate risk (Stringfellow et al., 2016). Those\
      \ with highest SUD risk also reported more difficulty \npaying for food, shelter,\
      \ and utilities; were less likely to have medical insurance; and experienced\
      \ more \nepisodic health conditions. \nService Models for People With CODs Who\
      \ Are Experiencing Homelessness \nTo address substance misuse, mental illness,\
      \ or both in clients who lack housing, there are several \nservice models providers\
      \ can follow, including: \n• \nSupportive housing—housing combined with access\
      \ to services and supports to address the needs \nof individuals without housing\
      \ so that they may live independently in the community. This model is \nan option\
      \ for individuals and families who have lived on the street for longer periods\
      \ of time or \nwhose needs can best be met by services accessed through their\
      \ housing."

      \ Disorders Among Special Populations \n \nPage 169 \n• \nLinear housing—housing\
      \ that is contingent on completion of treatment for SUDs or mental \ndisorders.\
      \ Subsidized housing programs participating in this model typically require\
      \ abstinence as a \ncondition of housing, often through completion of residential\
      \ treatment. \n• \nIntegrated treatment—receipt of housing concurrently with\
      \ addiction/mental health services. \nTo help clients with CODs address housing\
      \ needs, treatment programs need to establish ongoing \nrelationships with housing\
      \ authorities, landlords, and other housing providers. Groups and seminars \n\
      that discuss housing difficulties may be necessary to help clients with CODs\
      \ transition from residential \ntreatment to supportive or independent housing.\
      \ To ease clients’ transition, an effective strategy COD \ntreatment programs\
      \ can use is to coordinate housing tours with supportive housing programs. \
      \ \nRelapse prevention efforts are essential to help clients with CODs maintain\
      \ housing. Substance misuse \nmay disqualify clients from public housing in\
      \ the community (Curtis, Garlington, & Schottenfield, 2013). \nTIP 55, Behavioral\
      \ Health Services for People Who Are Homeless (SAMHSA, 2013) offers more information\
      \ \non treatment and recovery support approaches specific to people experiencing\
      \ or at risk for homelessness. \nSupportive Housing Model \nA systematic literature\
      \ review (Benston, 2015) found that permanent supportive housing programs for\
      \ \npeople experiencing homelessness and mental illness often led to better\
      \ housing stability (e.g., \npercentage of participants housed vs. not housed\
      \ at the end of the study, proportion of time spent in \nstable housing vs.\
      \ experiencing homelessness, number of days housed vs. homeless) compared with\
      \ \ncontrol conditions. Although the studies reported mixed results because\
      \ of variations in design, results, \nand definitions of “housing,” some, but\
      \ not all, found that supportive housing was associated with \nimprovement in\
      \ psychiatric symptoms and reduced substance use.  \nSimilarly, an earlier literature\
      \ review of treatments for people with CODs who were experiencing \nhomelessness\
      \ recommended use of supportive housing rather than treatment only or linear\
      \ models \n(Sun, 2012). Another review (Rog et al., 2014) found that, among\
      \ people with CODs, supportive housing \nwas associated with reduced homelessness\
      \ and improvements in housing tenure, less ED use, fewer \nhospitalizations,\
      \ and better client satisfaction (compared with linear housing models). \nHousing\
      \ First \nThe Housing First (HF) model provides housing no matter where a person\
      \ is in recovery from SUDs or \nmental disorders. HF is one of the best-known\
      \ and well-researched approaches to supportive housing. \nSAMHSA supports the\
      \ HF model as a preferred approach for addressing homelessness in individuals\
      \ \nwith mental illness, SUDs, or both, as does the U.S. Interagency Council\
      \ on Homelessness (2014). (See \n“Resource Alert: Implementing Supportive Housing\
      \ Programs.”) \nHF helps people with CODs (including SMI) establish stable housing\
      \ and is associated with good \nhousing retention rates (Collins, Malone, &\
      \ Clifasefi, 2013; Pringle et al., 2017; Watson, Orwat, Wagner, \nShuman, &\
      \ Tolliver, 2013). In some studies, HF is associated with better SUD outcomes\
      \ than treatment \nonly (Padgett, Stanhope, Henwood, & Stefancic, 2011). However,\
      \ research on SUD outcomes in HF has \ngenerally had mixed results (Paquette\
      \ & Pannella Winn, 2016). Compared with linear housing models, \nKertesz, Crouch,\
      \ Milby, Cusimano, and Schumacher (2009) found that HF showed better housing\
      \ \nstability and retention and, in some cases, favorable reductions in substance\
      \ misuse severity—but both \nmodels benefitted people experiencing homelessness\
      \ with SMI, SUDs, or both."

      \   \nThe following examples of supportive housing models have successfully\
      \ reduced homelessness and \nenhanced outcomes among people with SUDs, mental\
      \ disorders, or both. \nPathways to Housing \nThe well-known and heavily researched\
      \ Pathways to Housing program is an example of HF-based \nsupportive housing.\
      \ The program was originally designed (Tsemberis & Eisenberg, 2000; Tsemberis,\
      \ \nMoran, Shinn, Asmussen, & Shern, 2003) to serve a highly visible and vulnerable\
      \ segment of New York’s \npopulation experiencing homelessness: people with\
      \ CODs who were living in the streets, parks, subway \ntunnels, and similar\
      \ places. It has since been expanded to other areas, including Washington, DC,\
      \ \nVermont, Pennsylvania, and Canada. Pathways to Housing reflects a client-centered\
      \ perspective and \noffers clients experiencing homelessness the option of moving\
      \ directly into a furnished apartment of \ntheir own. However, clients must\
      \ agree to receive case management and work with a representative \npayee to\
      \ ensure that rent and utilities are paid and resources are well-managed (Tsemberis\
      \ & Eisenberg, \n2000). Pathways to Housing uses assertive community treatment\
      \ (ACT) teams to offer clients an array of \nsupport services in twice-monthly\
      \ sessions. Vocational, medical, behavioral health, and other services \nare\
      \ among the options.  \nHighlights of outcomes reported from Pathways to Housing\
      \ programs include the following: \n• \nPathways to Housing DC (2017) reported\
      \ a 91 percent housing success rate. \n• \nPathways to Housing PA (2018) supplied\
      \ 2,992 hours of medical, mental, and SUD treatment \nservices and 2,996 hours\
      \ of paid transitional employment. Additionally, 100 percent of clients \nretained\
      \ housing through the first year, and 65 percent were in SUD treatment after\
      \ 6 months. \n• \nOver about 3 years, Pathways to Housing VT achieved an 85\
      \ percent housing retention rate, and \nmean number of days spent homeless decreased\
      \ significantly over the course of a year (11 days at \nbaseline vs. 2 days\
      \ at 12-month follow-up) (Stefancic et al., 2013). \nLinear Housing Model \n\
      The linear model provides housing contingent on abstinence from substances.\
      \ It was once the preferred \napproach for aiding people with SUDs, mental disorders,\
      \ or CODs who were experiencing homelessness. \nResearch has since shown this\
      \ approach to produce less favorable housing retention outcomes than \nsupportive\
      \ housing (Kertesz et al., 2009; Polcin, 2016). Linear models often require\
      \ completion of an \nSUD treatment program (typically residential treatment)\
      \ in addition to abstinence before housing is \nprovided, yet SUD treatment\
      \ completion rates are frequently low. Often, linear programs also lack"

      \ Disorders Among Special Populations \n \nPage 171 \naccess to and control\
      \ of stable, permanent housing, which contributes to low rates of housing stability\
      \ \ncompared with permanent supportive housing programs such as HF (Kertesz\
      \ et al., 2009; Polcin, 2016).  \nLinear programs do appear effective in helping\
      \ clients improve substance use outcomes. Therapeutic \ncommunities (TCs), an\
      \ example of the linear model, have been shown to reduce substance use and \n\
      psychiatric symptoms, but according to some research, may not produce robust\
      \ improvements in \nhousing status (Kertesz et al., 2009). Compared with usual\
      \ care (e.g., receiving day treatment only), the \nBirmingham approach to the\
      \ linear housing model can improve both housing and substance use \noutcomes.\
      \ This approach offers referrals for private or public housing only upon completion\
      \ of a \ncomprehensive, community-based SUD treatment program that includes\
      \ behavioral interventions, \nemployment training, and community reinforcement\
      \ and supports (e.g., relapse prevention, goal \nsetting, rewards for achieving\
      \ objectively defined recovery goals). The Birmingham approach has \nsignificantly\
      \ improved abstinence, housing stability (especially among clients who achieve\
      \ longer-term \nabstinence), and employment; program retention has been moderate\
      \ to high (Kertesz et al., 2009). \nThe Role of Recovery Housing for People\
      \ With CODs \nRecovery housing is a critical issue for all clients with CODs–not\
      \ just those experiencing homelessness. Without \nstable supportive housing,\
      \ achieving and maintaining long-term recovery is less likely. The National\
      \ Alliance for \nRecovery Residences maintains a resource library on recovery\
      \ housing to help providers learn about the various \ntypes of recovery residences,\
      \ how recovery housing affects client outcomes, and how to support clients in\
      \ \nidentifying and obtaining housing that best meets their recovery needs (https://narronline.org/resources/).\
      \ \nIntegrated Housing and Treatment Models \nPeople experiencing homelessness\
      \ often have diverse, complex treatment and support needs. Thus, a \nmultifactorial,\
      \ flexible, integrated approach to addressing clients’ behavioral health and\
      \ housing \nneeds may be preferable, in some cases, to the more structured housing\
      \ service models described \npreviously (Polcin, 2016). The Comprehensive, Continuous,\
      \ Integrated System of Care is an integrated \nCOD treatment approach that has\
      \ been adapted to include housing and employment supports. In one \nprogram\
      \ using this approach (Harrison, Moore, Young, Flink, & Ochshorn, 2008), homelessness\
      \ \ndecreased by 90 percent, permanent housing increased by 202 percent, unemployment\
      \ decreased by 16 \npercent, and employment increased by 1,215 percent. The\
      \ program also showed decreases in number of \ndays of past-month illicit substance\
      \ use, and past-month substance use declined over the course of 6 \nmonths.\
      \ Other significant improvements included (Moore, Young, Barrett, & Ochshorn,\
      \ 2009):  \n• \nDecreased need for SUD treatment and psychological/emotional\
      \ services. \n• \nIncreased receipt of needed SUD treatment and psychological/emotional\
      \ services. \n• \nReductions in unmet medical needs. \n• \nDecreased self-reported\
      \ mental disorder symptoms. \nAdvice to the Counselor: Working With Clients\
      \ Who Have CODs and Are Experiencing \nHomelessness \nThe consensus panel recommends\
      \ that providers: \n• Address the housing needs of clients.  \n• Help clients\
      \ obtain housing.  \n• Teach clients skills for maintaining housing.  \n• Collaborate\
      \ with shelter workers and other providers of services to people experiencing\
      \ homelessness."

      \ in addition to housing, such as SUD treatment, legal/criminal justice matters,\
      \ \nSupplemental Security Insurance/entitlement applications, problems related\
      \ to children, and healthcare.  \nPeople Involved in the Criminal Justice System\
      \ \nEstimated rates of mental disorders and SUDs in prison populations vary\
      \ but are consistently high, often \nexceeding general population rates (Fazel,\
      \ Yoon, & Hayes, 2017; Reingle Gonzalez & Connell, 2014; \nMarotta, 2017). Among\
      \ those incarcerated in U.S. state prisons (Prins, 2014), mental disorders of\
      \ highest \nprevalence include:  \n• \n9 percent to 29 percent for current MDD.\
      \ \n• \n5.5 percent to 16 percent for bipolar disorder. \n• \n1 percent (women),\
      \ 5.5 percent (men and women), and 7 percent (men) for panic disorder. \n• \n\
      2 percent to 6.5 percent for schizophrenia. \nIn a sample of more than 8,000\
      \ U.S. inmates (Al-Rousan et al., 2017), nearly 48 percent had a history of\
      \ \nmental illness, 29 percent had an SMI, and 26 percent had an SUD. About\
      \ 48 percent of those with a \nmental illness also misused substances. People\
      \ on probation or parole from 2002 to 2014 had \nsignificantly higher rates\
      \ of DSM-IV SUDs than U.S. adults not on probation or parole (Fearn et al.,\
      \ 2016); \n13 percent had alcohol abuse (vs. 4 percent), 15 percent had alcohol\
      \ dependence (vs. 3 percent), 2 \npercent had illicit drug abuse (vs. 0.3 percent),\
      \ and 8 percent had illicit drug dependence (vs. 1 percent). \nRationale for\
      \ Treatment \nInmates with a history of mental illness or CODs are at higher\
      \ risk of violence (Peters et al., 2017). They \nare more likely to be charged\
      \ with violent crimes before incarceration and to experience or perpetrate \n\
      prison-related assaults during incarceration (Wood, 2013).  \nAmong individuals\
      \ in the criminal justice system, comorbid SMI and SUDs substantially increase\
      \ the risk of \nmultiple reincarcerations compared with having either disorder\
      \ alone (Baillargeon et al., 2010). However, the \nodds of incarceration are\
      \ reduced when people engage in SUD treatment (Luciano, Belstock, et al., 2014).\
      \ \nThe rationale for providing SUD treatment in the criminal justice system\
      \ is based on the well-\nestablished link between substance misuse and criminal\
      \ behavior. The overall goal of SUD treatment \nfor criminal offenders, especially\
      \ those who have engaged in violence, is to reduce criminality.  \nEvidence\
      \ suggests that people with CODs can be effectively treated while incarcerated\
      \ (Peters et al., \n2017). Unfortunately, despite the high need for services,\
      \ lifetime treatment rates among offenders with \nCODs are low: approximately\
      \ 38 percent have received any type of previous behavioral health services;\
      \ \n27 percent, inpatient or outpatient SUD treatment; 4 percent, inpatient\
      \ mental health services; 7 \npercent, both SUD treatment and mental health\
      \ services; and 16 percent, any type of behavioral health \nservice during the\
      \ past year (Hunt, Peters, & Kremling, 2015). \nTreatment Features, Approaches,\
      \ and Empirical Evidence \nSeveral features distinguish COD treatment programs\
      \ currently available in the criminal justice system \nfrom other treatment\
      \ programs: \n• \nStaff are trained and experienced in treating both mental\
      \ disorders and SUDs. \n• \nBoth disorders are treated as “primary.”"

      \ model, and cognitive–behavioral therapy \n(CBT) (Peters et al., 2017):  \n\

      \ Security income, Medicaid; Peters et al., 2017).  \nSmith, Jennings, and Cimino\

      with CODs transition from incarceration on an inpatient forensic unit to community\
      \ living. Participants \nwere provided stage-specific skills and interventions\
      \ (e.g., support to improve self-care, medication \nmanagement, relapse prevention,\
      \ enhanced socialization). Stages of treatments were tied to behavioral \nrewards\
      \ and increased privileges (such as less supervision) and included assessment\
      \ and orientation, a \nCBT program, a prerelease stage, and conditional release\
      \ and community continuing care programming. \nNinety percent of individuals\
      \ who completed the program had “overall success” (e.g., no psychiatric \nstate\
      \ hospital readmissions and no rearrests following release), 75 percent maintained\
      \ substance \nabstinence, and 82 percent maintained steady housing (i.e., keeping\
      \ a consistent home without being \nevicted, ejected, or changing residences\
      \ more than three times in any year). Interestingly, of the 5 \nindividuals\
      \ who were rearrested following release, all had maintained substance abstinence,\
      \ stable \nhousing, and employment.  \nMeanwhile, Cusack, Morrissey, Cuddeback,\
      \ Prins, and Williams (2010) compared forensic adaptations of \nACT for criminal\
      \ justice-involved individuals who had mental illness, SUDs, or CODs with usual\
      \ \ntreatment. They found reductions in jail bookings and psychiatric hospitalizations,\
      \ increases in the use of \noutpatient mental health services, increases in\
      \ the odds of staying out of jail after release, and \ndecreases in inpatient\
      \ psychiatric service costs and per-person jail costs.  \nIn 2002, the National\
      \ Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) established the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse\
      \ Treatment \nStudies Series to fund regional research centers meant to forge\
      \ partnerships between SUD treatment providers \nand the criminal justice system.\
      \ The goal is to foster the design and testing of approaches to better integrate\

      \ Disorders Among Special Populations \n \nPage 175 \nIn the United States,\
      \ mental illness prevalence estimates are higher for women than men. The 2018\
      \ \nNSDUH showed that approximately 15 percent of men ages 18 and older reported\
      \ a past-year mental \nillness compared with approximately 23 percent of women.\
      \ However, rates very close for SMI (3.4 \npercent for men and 5.7 percent for\
      \ women), CODs (4.0 percent for men and 3.4 for women), and \ncombined SUDs\
      \ with SMI (1.1 percent for men and 1.4 percent for women). More women than\
      \ men \nwith any mental illness received mental health services in 2018, whether\
      \ including or excluding SMI \n(CBHSQ, 2019). \nTreatment Approaches for Women\
      \ \nSUD treatment \nWomen disproportionately face barriers to treatment related\
      \ to children and childcare. Responsibility \nfor care of dependent children\
      \ is one of the most significant barriers women face in entering treatment,\
      \ \nas many programs will not enroll women who lack child care (Taylor, 2010).\
      \ Women who enter \ntreatment sometimes risk losing public financial assistance\
      \ and custody of their children, making the \ndecision to begin treatment a\
      \ difficult one (Taylor, 2010). However, women accompanied by their \nchildren\
      \ into treatment can achieve successful outcomes. The Iowa Pregnant and Postpartum\
      \ Women’s \nResidential Treatment Program (https://idph.iowa.gov/substance-abuse/programs/ppw),\
      \ funded \nthrough a SAMHSA grant, reported a 76 percent treatment completion\
      \ rate and 90.5 percent abstinence \nrate from drugs and alcohol at 5 to 8 months\
      \ after admission (Jones & Arndt, 2017). \nOther barriers to SUD treatment women\
      \ face include (McHugh, Votaw, Sugarman, & Greenfield, 2018; \nTaylor, 2010):\
      \ \n• \nFear of stigma, shame, and embarrassment, especially among women with\
      \ a history of sex work. \n• \nLack of support from partners, family, or friends.\
      \ \n• \nInability to afford the high cost of treatment; women are less likely\
      \ than men to have health \ninsurance or sufficient funds to cover costs. Women\
      \ and children programs are limited across States.  \n• \nDenial or tendency\
      \ to attribute substance-related problems to sources other than the addiction\
      \ \nitself (like stress or physical health). \n• \nAvoidance of programs including\
      \ men, particularly if there is a history of physical or sexual abuse. \n• \n\
      Presence of a co-occurring mental illness, especially PTSD, depression, anxiety,\
      \ or an eating disorder. \nCODs in women may lead to difficulty initiating,\
      \ engaging in, and completing treatment. \nWomen differ from men in their SUD\
      \ treatment initiation and participation behaviors and needs \n(Grella, 2008;\
      \ McHugh et al., 2018; NIDA, 2018d, July): \n• \nWomen are more likely to be\
      \ referred to or enter treatment via community-based social services, \nlike\
      \ welfare and child welfare programs, and are less likely to enter via the criminal\
      \ justice system.  \n• \nWomen are more likely to require public assistance\
      \ to pay for treatment.  \n• \nWomen may be more likely to initiate treatment\
      \ after fewer years of substance misuse than men, \nbut their clinical profiles\
      \ are often more severe (e.g., greater psychosocial distress, greater odds of\
      \ \ntrauma experience, higher childcare burden, worse functional impairment).\
      \ They also tend to start \nsubstance use at a later age but progress from first\
      \ use to addiction faster than men do. \n• \nWomen with SUDs have a higher reported\
      \ prevalence of mental disorders, particularly internalizing \nconditions (e.g.,\
      \ depression, anxiety, eating disorders, PTSD) and lower self-esteem, whereas\
      \ men \nwith SUDs are more likely to exhibit externalizing conditions (e.g.,\
      \ antisocial personality disorder \n[PD])."

      \ Disorders Among Special Populations \n \nPage 176 \n• \nWhereas women with\
      \ SUDs report having more difficulty with emotional problems, their male \n\
      counterparts report having more trouble with functioning (e.g., work, money,\
      \ legal problems).  \nRegarding treatment outcomes, large-scale randomized clinical\
      \ trials have been mixed in their findings \nbut generally find no gender differences.\
      \ \nOver the past two decades, there has been an increase in policy and research\
      \ supporting the need for \ngender-sensitive SUD treatments. Compared with mixed-gender\
      \ approaches (Grella, 2008; McHugh et \nal., 2018), some women-specific programs\
      \ have been linked to:  \n• \nBetter treatment retention and substance use outcomes\
      \ (including abstinence). \n• \nBetter client satisfaction, comfort, and self-reported\
      \ feelings of safety. \n• \nReduced risk of criminal activity and incarceration.\
      \ \n• \nHigher rates of receiving continuity of care.  \nPositive outcomes are\
      \ especially likely in programs that include residential treatment with in-house\
      \ \naccommodations for children, outpatient treatments that incorporate family\
      \ therapy, and \ncomprehensive services that address women-specific needs (e.g.,\
      \ case management, pregnancy-\nrelated services, parenting training/classes,\
      \ childcare, job training, and continuing care). Gender-specific \ntreatments\
      \ are effective in several subpopulations of women, including those with children,\
      \ CODs, \ntrauma history, or criminal justice system involvement (McHugh et\
      \ al., 2018). \nPrograms offering COD treatment have a responsibility to address\
      \ women’s specific needs. Mixed-\ngender programs need to be responsive to women’s\
      \ needs. Women in mixed-gender outpatient \nprograms require careful, appropriate\
      \ counselor matching and the availability of specialized women-\nonly groups\
      \ to address sensitive topics such as trauma, parenting, stigma, and self-esteem.\
      \ Strong \nadministrative policies pertaining to sexual harassment, safety,\
      \ and language must be clearly stated and \nupheld. The same responsibility\
      \ exists for residential programs designed for women who have multiple \nand\
      \ complex needs and require a safe environment for stabilization, intensive\
      \ treatment, and an \nintensive recovery support structure. Residential treatment\
      \ for pregnant women with CODs should \nprovide integrated SUD and mental disorder\
      \ treatment and primary medical care, as well as attention to \nrelated problems\
      \ and disorders. The needs of women in residential care depend in part on the\
      \ severity \nand complexity of their co-occurring mental disorders. Other areas\
      \ meriting attention include past or \npresent history of domestic violence\
      \ or sexual abuse, physical health, and pregnancy or parental status. \nExhibit\
      \ 6.1 lists suggestions for gender-responsive SUD treatment. TIP 51, Substance\
      \ Abuse Treatment: \nAddressing the Specific Needs of Women (SAMHSA, 2009c)\
      \ offers more information on adapting \nbehavioral health services to the needs\
      \ of women. \nExhibit 6.1. Adapting Treatment Services to Women’s Needs \n•\
      \ Use nonconfrontational, strengths-based, trauma-informed treatment approaches.\
      \ \n• Offer evidence-based interventions that have been researched specifically\
      \ in female populations. \n• Ensure staff training and competencies regarding\
      \ women-specific problems in substance misuse. \n• Provide: \n− Prenatal/postnatal\
      \ services. \n− Women-only groups. \n− Parenting training/counseling. \n− Trauma/abuse\

      \ Arieira (2012). \nCOD Treatment \nThe treatment barriers and socioeconomic\
      \ burdens facing women with either SUDs or mental illness \nalone are multiplied\
      \ in women with both conditions, leading to substantial challenges that make\
      \ \nrecovery more difficult and relapse more likely. Women with SUDs frequently\
      \ have comorbid mental \ndisorders, including SMI (Evans, Padwa, Li, Lin, &\
      \ Hser, 2015). This leads to more severe symptoms, \nworse functioning, lower\
      \ quality of life, and more complex treatment needs than for women who only\
      \ \nhave SUDs. Specifically, women with CODs (particularly involving SMI, like\
      \ bipolar disorder or psychosis) \nare more like than women with only SUDs to\
      \ (Evans et al., 2015):  \n• \nExperience homelessness. \n• \nBe unmarried.\
      \ \n• \nHave a past history of physical or sexual abuse. \n• \nReceive public\
      \ assistance. \n• \nHave a longer substance use history. \n• \nHave more severe\
      \ alcohol use-related problems. \n• \nHave more severe problems related to employment.\
      \ \n• \nHave more severe medical conditions. \n• \nHave greater family dysfunctions.\
      \ \n• \nBe on psychiatric medication. \nServices for women with CODs should\
      \ address these disparities. Women with CODs may also lack \nsocial support\
      \ compared with women who have only SUDs; counselors should help women with\
      \ CODs \nlocate and use supportive services (Brown, Harris, & Fallot, 2013).\
      \  \nWomen receiving treatment for SUDs or CODs often benefit from trauma-informed\
      \ approaches. \nTrauma is present in an overwhelming majority of women with\
      \ CODs (SAMHSA, 2015c, March), \nregardless of their age. Most women have a\
      \ history of at least one adverse childhood experience, often \nabuse (Choi\
      \ et al., 2017). However, women with CODs are less likely than women with SUDs\
      \ only to \nenter treatment and to receive ongoing care (Bernstein et al., 2015),\
      \ despite mental disorders and SUDs \nboth being disabling in women and a common\
      \ cause of inpatient hospitalization (Bennett, Gibson, \nRohan, Howland, & Rankin,\
      \ 2018).  \nWomen with CODs—and particularly with SMI and SUDs—often do not\
      \ receive services for their conditions. \nOf women who entered SUD treatment\
      \ with a co-occurring mental illness (Evans et al., 2015), almost 30 percent\
      \ \nwith a comorbid mental disorder received no mental health services over\
      \ the course of 8 years, including 7 \npercent with co-occurring psychosis,\
      \ 13 percent with bipolar disorder, and 20 percent with depressive disorder."

      \ Disorders Among Special Populations \n \nPage 178 \nPregnancy and CODs \n\
      Pregnancy can both aggravate and diminish the symptoms of co-occurring mental\
      \ illness. Women with \nschizophrenia may experience a worsening of symptoms,\
      \ whereas women with bipolar disorder have \nexhibited lower rates of new onset\
      \ or recurrence of symptoms (Jones, Chandra, Dazzan, & Howard, \n2014). Ample\
      \ research has examined MDD during the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal periods.\
      \ \nAntidepressant discontinuation or untreated depression during pregnancy\
      \ can exacerbate symptoms, \nincluding those related to risk of suicide, and\
      \ worsen outcomes for both mother and child (Gentile, \n2017; Vigod, Wilson,\
      \ & Howard, 2016). However, pregnancy has been linked to lower substance use\
      \ in \nwomen, even if abstinence is temporary (Muhuri & Gfroerer, 2009; SAMHSA,\
      \ 2009c). Compared with \nwomen who have a single disorder or no disorder, pregnant\
      \ women with CODs are at elevated risk for \nnegative perinatal outcomes, including\
      \ birth complications, premature birth, low infant birthweight, \nnonadherence\
      \ to prenatal care, child developmental delays, and poorer psychosocial functioning\
      \ \n(Benningfield et al., 2010; Lee King, Duan, & Amaro, 2015).  \nTopics to\
      \ Address With Co-Occurring Mental Illness \nCareful treatment plans are essential\
      \ for pregnant women with mental disorders. Plans should address \nchildbirth\
      \ and infant care. Women often are concerned about the effects of their medication\
      \ on their \nfetuses. Treatment programs should aim to maintain medical and\
      \ mental stability during clients’ \npregnancies and collaborate with other\
      \ healthcare providers to ensure coordination of treatment.  \nExperts recommend\
      \ a multidisciplinary approach to perinatal COD treatment, including consultation\
      \ \nwith providers in obstetrics, addiction, mental health, and pediatrics on\
      \ pharmacotherapy (e.g., selective \nserotonin-reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs],\
      \ medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder [OUD]), \nindividual\
      \ counseling (e.g., CBT, exposure, other trauma-based therapies), SUD treatment,\
      \ prenatal care, \nmaternal education, health promotion, and linkage to social\
      \ services (Goodman, Milliken, Theiler, \nNordstrom, & Akerman, 2015).  \nPregnant\
      \ women with CODs report desiring SUD treatment that includes (Kuo et al., 2013):\
      \  \n• \nMore flexible treatment schedules. \n• \nLonger sessions. \n• \nAssistance\
      \ with transportation to and from sessions. \n• \nGroup treatments. \n• \nInterpersonal\
      \ support (from partners, friends, family, and counselors). \n• \nLinkage to\
      \ community resources (like mutual support programs). \n• \nTreatment environments\
      \ that convey a sense of safety and comfort.  \nWhen women are parenting, it\
      \ can often retrigger their own childhood traumas. Therefore, providers \nneed\
      \ to balance growth and healing with coping and safety. Focusing on women’s\
      \ interest in and desire \nto be good mothers, the sensitive counselor will\
      \ be alert to guilt, shame, denial, and resistance related \nto dealing with\
      \ these problems, as recovering women gain awareness of effective parenting\
      \ skills. \nProviders should allow for evaluation over time for women with CODs.\
      \ Reassessments should occur as \nmothers progress through treatment. \nPharmacological\
      \ Considerations \nBefore giving any medications to pregnant women, it is vital\
      \ that they understand the risks and \nbenefits of taking medications and sign\
      \ informed consent forms verifying receipt and understanding of"

      \ to them. Certain psychoactive medications may be associated with birth \n\
      defects, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy; weighing potential\
      \ risk/benefit is important. In \nmost cases, a sensible direction can be found\
      \ through consultation with physicians and pharmacists who \nhave expertise\
      \ in treating pregnant women with mental disorders. Screen women for dependence\
      \ on \nsubstances that can produce life-threatening withdrawal for the mother:\
      \ alcohol, benzodiazepines, and \nbarbiturates. These substances, as well as\
      \ opioids, can cause a withdrawal syndrome in babies as well, \nwho may need\
      \ treatment. Make pregnant women aware of wraparound services to assist them\
      \ in \nmanaging newborns, including food, shelter, medical clinics for inoculations,\
      \ and so forth. Also ensure \nthat women are informed of programs that can help\
      \ with developmental or physical problems the infant \nmay experience as a result\
      \ of alcohol or drug exposure.  \nPregnancy and Medication-Assisted Treatment\
      \ for OUD \nThe approval of three medications by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\
      \ to treat OUD—methadone, \nbuprenorphine, and naltrexone—has given the primary\
      \ care and behavioral health fields powerful new tools to \nfight the opioid\
      \ epidemic and save lives.  \nConsiderations for medication-assisted treatment\
      \ to address OUD in pregnant women include the following: \n• MAT is possible\
      \ for women with OUD who are pregnant and should be actively considered, given\
      \ the wealth \nof evidence showing its effectiveness in reducing opioid use\
      \ and preventing overdose.  \n• Pregnant women should be considered for methadone\
      \ or transmucosal buprenorphine treatment. \n• Pregnant women treated with methadone\
      \ or sublingual or buccal buprenorphine have better outcomes than \npregnant\
      \ women not in treatment who continue to misuse opioids. \n• Little research\

      \ \nThe term “postpartum depression” (PPD) in DSM-5 refers to MDD in which the\
      \ most recent depressive \nepisode has an onset either during pregnancy or within\
      \ 4 weeks after delivery (American Psychiatric \nAssociation [APA], 2013). DSM-5\
      \ designates such cases through the MDD specifier “with peripartum \nonset.”\
      \ (See Chapter 4 for DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for MDD.)  \nPPD prevalence estimates\
      \ vary, given differences in timeframes researchers define for the postpartum\
      \ \nperiod. According to DSM-5 (APA, 2013), 3 percent to 6 percent of women\
      \ will experience a major \ndepressive episode either during pregnancy or in\
      \ the weeks and months following childbirth. In a sample \nof 10,000 mothers\
      \ screened for depression 4 to 6 weeks following delivery, 14 percent were positive\
      \ for \ndepression (Wisner et al., 2013). Forty percent had postpartum onset,\
      \ 33 percent had onset during \npregnancy, and 27 percent had onset prior to\
      \ pregnancy. Thoughts of self-harm occurred in 19 percent. \nPPD is considered\
      \ distinct from postpartum “blues,” which is a mild, transient depression occurring\
      \ most \ncommonly within 3 to 5 days after delivery in about 30 percent to 80\
      \ percent of women after childbirth \n(Buttner, O’Hara, & Watson, 2012; Jones\
      \ & Shakespeare, 2014). Prominent in its causes are a woman’s \nemotional letdown\

      \ giving birth, hormonal changes, fatigue from loss of sleep during labor and\
      \ \nwhile hospitalized, energy expenditure at labor, and anxieties about caring\
      \ for the newborn at home. \nSymptoms include weepiness, insomnia, depression,\
      \ anxiety, poor concentration, moodiness, and \nirritability. These symptoms\
      \ tend to be mild and transient, and women usually recover completely with \n\
      rest and reassurance. Anticipation and preventive reassurance throughout pregnancy\
      \ can prevent \npostpartum blues from becoming a problem. Women with sleep deprivation\
      \ should be assisted in \ngetting proper rest. Follow-up care should ensure\
      \ that the woman is making sufficient progress and not \nheading toward a relapse\
      \ to substance use. \nModerate-to-strong risk factors for PPD include prior\
      \ history of depression, anxiety, or other mental \ndistress during pregnancy;\
      \ prepregnancy mental disorder diagnosis (especially depression); presence of\
      \ \npostpartum blues; psychosocial stress (e.g., poor marital relationships,\
      \ lack of social support, childcare-\nrelated distress); and certain personality\
      \ traits and features (i.e., neuroticism, low self-esteem) (O’Hara \n& McCabe,\
      \ 2013).  \nProspects for recovery from PPD are good with supportive mental\
      \ health counseling (especially for \nacute cases) accompanied as needed by\
      \ pharmacotherapy, particularly in severe PPD (Thomson & \nSharma, 2017). Various\
      \ forms of counseling (e.g., CBT, behavioral activation, interpersonal therapy),\
      \ \npharmacotherapy (e.g., SSRIs, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors),\
      \ and brain stimulation (e.g., \nelectroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial\
      \ magnetic stimulation) have all been successful in \ntreating PPD (Guille,\
      \ Newman, Fryml, Lifton, & Epperson, 2013; O’Hara & Engeldinger, 2018; Thomson\
      \ & \nSharma, 2017). Because some medications pass into breastmilk and can cause\
      \ infant sedation, it is \nbest to consult an experienced psychiatrist or pharmacist\
      \ for details on pharmacotherapy.  \nPatients with PPD need to be monitored\
      \ for thoughts of suicide, infanticide, and progression of \npsychosis in addition\
      \ to their response to treatment. Postpartum psychosis is a serious but rare\
      \ \nmental disorder, with first lifetime onset occurring in 0.25 to 0.6 per\
      \ 1,000 births (Bergink, Rasgon, & \nWisner, 2016). Women with this disorder\
      \ may lose touch with reality and experience delusions, \nhallucinations, and\
      \ disorganized speech or behavior. Women most likely to be diagnosed with \n\
      postpartum psychosis have a previous diagnosis or family history of bipolar\
      \ disorder or other psychotic \ndisorders (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective\
      \ disorder) (Davies, 2017). Other studies reviewed by \nBergink and colleagues\
      \ (2016) indicate that physiological factors, such as hormonal, immunological,\
      \ and \ncircadian rhythm disturbances, can increase the risk of postpartum psychosis\
      \ in women who are already \ngenetically vulnerable (e.g., those with a personal\
      \ or family history of bipolar disorder, those with \ncertain variants of the\
      \ serotonin transporter gene). Typical onset is 3 to 10 days after delivery\
      \ (Bergink \net al., 2016).  \nPostpartum psychosis is associated with an increased\
      \ risk of suicide and infanticide (Bergink et al., \n2016; Brockington, 2017).\
      \ As such, the severity of the symptoms mandates immediate evaluation (for \n\
      diagnosis and for safety), which often needs to be performed in an inpatient\
      \ setting, and treatment with \nbenzodiazepines, lithium, antipsychotics, electroconvulsive\
      \ therapy, or a combination thereof (Bergink \net al., 2016; Doucet, Jones,\
      \ Letourneau, Dennis, & Blackmore, 2011). The risk of self-harm or harm to the\
      \ \nbaby needs to be assessed. Monitoring of mother–infant pairs by trained\
      \ personnel can limit risks. \nPPD and substance misuse \nLittle research has\
      \ examined the relationship between PPD and substance use. One review of \n\
      substance use in postpartum women found that problematic alcohol use occurred\
      \ in 1.5 percent to 8 \npercent and drug use (cocaine and prescription psychoactive\
      \ drugs) occurred in 2.5 percent (Chapman \n& Wu, 2013). Among women who reported\

      \ was highly prevalent (20 percent to 46 percent). However, the women \nparticipating\
      \ in these studies were likely to have had higher rates of depression than the\
      \ general \npopulation to begin with because of low income and socially marginalized\
      \ status (e.g., teenage \nmothers). The review also found that alcohol or illicit\
      \ drug use was associated with higher scores of \ndepression in postpartum women.\
      \ These findings are consistent with an earlier review (Ross & Dennis, \n2009)\
      \ that similarly observed an association between substance use and an increased\
      \ risk of PPD. \nWomen, Trauma, and Violence \nUp to 80 percent of women seeking\
      \ SUD treatment have a lifetime history of physical or sexual \nvictimization,\
      \ often traced back to childhood (Cohen, Field, Campbell, & Hien, 2013). Intimate\
      \ partner \nviolence is also strongly connected to women’s substance misuse\
      \ and mental illness (Macy, Renz, & \nPelino, 2013; Mason & Dumont, 2015). In\
      \ addition to SUDs, trauma-exposed individuals in the \ncommunity who have PTSD\
      \ are at an increased risk for MDD, dysthymic disorder, bipolar I and II \n\
      disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia without\
      \ panic disorder, social and \nspecific phobias, and lifetime suicide attempt\
      \ (Pietrzak, Goldstein, Southwick, & Grant, 2011). \nPeople seeking SUD treatment\
      \ who have PTSD are 14 times more likely to have an SUD than people \nwithout\
      \ PTSD (McCauley, Killeen, Gros, Brady, & Back, 2012). In the general public,\
      \ lifetime prevalence \nrates of PTSD (full or partial) are double in women\
      \ than in men, with 46 percent of people with full PTSD \nalso meeting criteria\
      \ for an SUD (Pietrzak et al., 2011). Women who are incarcerated have even higher\
      \ \nrates of each disorder—88 percent with full or partial PTSD and 87 percent\
      \ with an SUD (Wolff et al., \n2011). Women with trauma/PTSD may misuse substances\
      \ to avoid intrusive, distressing symptoms (e.g., \nflashbacks, nightmares)\
      \ or to numb themselves to emotional pain (Dass-Brailsford & Safilian, 2017).\
      \  \nFew SUD treatment programs assess for, treat, or educate clients about\
      \ trauma and instead focus on \nmanaging the addiction (Macy et al., 2013).\
      \ This is a serious deficiency, given the many interrelated \nconsequences of\
      \ failing to address trauma. Greater violence leads to more serious substance\
      \ misuse and \nother addictions (e.g., eating disorders, sexual addiction, compulsive\
      \ exercise), along with higher rates \nof depression, self-harm, and suicidal\
      \ impulses. People with PTSD and AUD, for example, are vulnerable \nto more\
      \ severe symptoms, greater risk of comorbid mood and PDs, worse physical functioning,\
      \ and \nhigher risk of suicide attempt than those with either disorder alone\
      \ (Blanco et al., 2013). SUDs place \nwomen at higher risk of future trauma\
      \ through associations with dangerous people and lowered self-\nprotection when\
      \ using substances (e.g., going home with a stranger after drinking).  \nIntegrated\
      \ trauma-informed treatment programs and approaches may be equally or more efficacious\
      \ \nor effective than usual care in reducing substance misuse and psychiatric\
      \ symptoms. Examples include \nintegrated CBT, Seeking Safety, the Treatment\
      \ Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy \nprogram, the Addictions\
      \ and Trauma Recovery Integration program, the Concurrent Treatment of PTSD\
      \ \nand Substance Use Disorders Using Prolonged Exposure program, and the Trauma\
      \ Recovery and \nEmpowerment Model (Dass-Brailsford & Safilian, 2017; Killeen,\
      \ Back, & Brady, 2015). \nFor more information about trauma and for guidance\

      \ Backgrounds \nAs racial and ethnic diversity in the United States increases,\
      \ the need to address cultural differences in \nmental health and SUD treatment\
      \ access, provision, and outcomes is becoming more urgent.  \nPer NSDUH data\
      \ (CBHSQ, 2019), 2.9 percent of Whites had a past-year illicit drug use disorder\
      \ in 2018 \nversus about 3.4 percent of African Americans, 4.0 percent of American\
      \ Indians and Alaskan Natives, 3 \npercent of Latinos, and 1.6 percent of Asian\
      \ Americans. AUD, prevalence was 5.7 percent among Whites, \n4.5 percent among\
      \ African Americans, 7.1 percent among American Indians or Alaskan Native, 5.3\
      \ \npercent among Latinos, and 3.8 percent among Asian Americans. Approximately\
      \ 16 percent of African \nAmerican adults ages 18 and older had any past-year\
      \ mental illness in 2018; similar rates occurred in \nother groups, including\
      \ Latinos (16.9 percent), Asian Americans (14.7 percent). By comparison, 20.4\
      \ \npercent of Whites and 22.1 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives\
      \ reported any past-year \nmental illness. \nCultural Perceptions of Substance\
      \ Misuse, Mental Disorders, and Healing \nClients may have culturally determined\
      \ concepts of what it means to misuse substances or to have a \nmental disorder,\
      \ what causes these disorders, and how they may be “cured.” Providers are encouraged\
      \ \nto explore these concepts with people who are familiar with the cultures\
      \ represented in their client \npopulation. Counselors should be alert to differences\
      \ in how their role and the healing process are \nperceived by people who are\
      \ of cultures other than their own. Whenever appropriate, familiar healing \n\
      practices meaningful to clients should be integrated into treatment. An example\
      \ would be the use of \nacupuncture to calm a Chinese client or help control\
      \ cravings.  \nCultural Perceptions and Diagnosis \nIt is important to be aware\
      \ of cultural and ethnic bias in diagnosis. For example, in the past some \n\
      African Americans were stereotyped as having paranoid PDs, whereas women have\
      \ been diagnosed \nfrequently as being histrionic or borderline. American Indians\
      \ with spiritual visions have been \nmisdiagnosed as delusional or as having\
      \ borderline or schizotypal PDs. Diagnostic criteria should be \ntempered by\
      \ sensitivity to cultural differences in behavior and emotional expression and\
      \ by an \nawareness of the provider’s own biases and stereotyping.\n\n[Page\

      \ about treatment access and \nuse, as people of diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds\
      \ are disproportionately uninsured (Kaiser Family \nFoundation, 2017; Sohn,\
      \ 2017). Racial and ethnic populations have historically faced more financial\
      \ and \nnonfinancial barriers to healthcare in general than Whites, including\
      \ low cultural competency in their \ntreatment providers (Mitchell, 2015). These\
      \ barriers lead to worse health outcomes (e.g., increased \nmorbidity, worse\
      \ quality of care) as well as higher healthcare costs. Similarly, marginalized\
      \ groups face \nsystemic, organizational, cultural, and attitudinal obstacles\
      \ to SUD treatment and mental health services \n(Holden et al., 2014; Keen et\
      \ al., 2014; Masson et al., 2013; Maura & Weisman de Mamani, 2017; \nPinedo,\
      \ Zemore, & Rogers, 2018), including: \n• \nFear of stigma and feelings of shame.\
      \ \n• \nMistrust of providers. \n• \nLanguage barriers. \n• \nLogistical obstacles\
      \ (e.g., lack of transportation, too long wait times). \n• \nFearing the provider\
      \ will not understand the client’s culture, religion, or circumstances (e.g.,\
      \ \nimmigration) or that the services won’t be culturally responsive. \n• \n\
      Lack of insurance. \n• \nNot knowing where to go for treatment. \n• \nNot believing\
      \ treatment is needed. \n• \nLacking confidence in treatment effectiveness.\
      \ \n• \nNot wanting to abstain from substances. \n• \nFamily factors (e.g.,\
      \ lack of support, pressure to not enter treatment, withdrawal of financial\
      \ help, \nnot including family in treatment). \nThe effects of these barriers\
      \ are reflected in lagging rates of treatment access, utilization, and \ncompletion\
      \ for mental illnesses, SUDs, or CODs by diverse ethnic/racial populations compared\
      \ with \nRacial/Ethnic Disparities and SMI \nFindings from a 2017 review of\

      \ \n• African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos offered mental health\

      \ retention is lower for African Americans than for Whites. \n• African Americans\
      \ have worse mental health outcomes following inpatient treatment than Whites.\
      \ \n• Minorities are more likely to drop out of treatment by psychologists,\

      \ than Whites to receive continuing care (e.g., medication management, \noutpatient\
      \ visits/follow-up services) following hospital discharge. \n• Diverse racial\
      \ and ethnic populations in medical settings are more likely to use emergency\

      \ underassessment, \nunderdiagnosis, and underreferral (Priester et al., 2016)\
      \ as well as from cultural barriers.  \nRates of SUD treatment provided in criminal\

      \ disparities through strategies \nsuch as (Maura & Weisman de Mamani, 2017;\
      \ Sanchez et al., 2016): \n• \nUsing bilingual case managers. \n• \nMaintaining\
      \ a diverse workforce. \n• \nEnsuring staff are trained in culturally responsive\
      \ care. \n• \nUsing multilingual mutual support programs. \n• \nUsing patient\
      \ navigators to help clients access community resources and overcome logistical\
      \ barriers \n(e.g., keeping appointments). \n• \nPerforming assessments that\
      \ address clients’ cultural concepts/understanding of their symptoms. \n• \n\
      Using culturally relevant interpretations and frameworks to describe mental\
      \ disorders (e.g., \ndepression) rather than solely relying on Western definitions.\
      \ \n• \nEliciting client preferences about treatment decisions, including giving\
      \ the option to forego \nmedication in favor of psychotherapy. \n• \nWhen appropriate,\
      \ including family in the treatment process and in education about mental illness.\
      \ \n• \nUsing patient-centered communication to improve client education and\
      \ reduce stigma, shame, and \nmisunderstanding. \n• \nUsing sensitive, empathic,\
      \ person-centered communication to build trust and enhance rapport. \n• \nProviding\

      \ and Treatment: Empirical Evidence on Effectiveness \nStudies of cultural differences\

      services have been linked to small-to-moderate benefits compared with nonadapted\

      \ Disorders Among Special Populations \n \nPage 185 \nplacebo, waitlists, and\
      \ usual care (Cabassa & Baumann, 2013). For example, a review of culturally\
      \ \nresponsive mental health services for people with SUDs (Gainsbury, 2017)\
      \ reported that: \n• \nCulturally tailored psychosocial interventions increase\
      \ treatment engagement and participation, \nenhance client–provider alliance,\
      \ reduce early treatment discontinuation, and improve symptoms. \n• \nCultural\
      \ competence training for staff is associated with improved communication, more\
      \ accurate \ndiagnosis, a positive therapeutic alliance, and greater client\
      \ satisfaction. \n• \nProviding treatment in a client’s native language or dialect\
      \ can lead to better treatment outcomes \nand may be more influential than matching\
      \ provider race/ethnicity to the client. \n• \nProviders who show greater comfort\
      \ with openly discussing cultural identities and values with \nclients may have\
      \ better client retention rates than those who are uneasy talking about such\
      \ topics. \nCultural competence should be a goal for programs as well as providers.\
      \ In a study of more than 350 \nnationally representative outpatient SUD treatment\
      \ programs (Guerrero & Andrews, 2011), program \ncultural competence—namely,\
      \ managers’ culturally sensitive beliefs—predicted reduced client wait \ntime\
      \ and increased retention among Latinos and African Americans. Program leadership\
      \ can influence \nstaff uptake of culturally responsive care, translating to\
      \ potentially better outcomes for clients. \nAdvice to the Counselor: Using\
      \ Culturally Appropriate Methods \nThe consensus panel recommends these modifications\
      \ to provide culturally appropriate COD treatment:  \n• Adapting interventions\
      \ by altering the content of materials or communications to reflect racial/ethnic\
      \ or \ncultural facts, values, imagery, beliefs, and norms. Engage members of\
      \ the community (such as through focus \ngroups) to ensure content adaptations\
      \ are appropriate, accurate, and relevant. \n• Use translated materials to meet\
      \ the needs of clients for whom English is not a primary language. Simplified\
      \ \nmaterials (such as those using illustrations, which can be more universally\
      \ understood) are also desirable. \n• Tailor services by culturally matching\
      \ counselors to clients (if possible) and via culture-specific resources.  \n\
      • When able, implement programs directly in the community where clients reside.\
      \ \n• Take into account the client’s cultural beliefs about mental health, substance\
      \ use, help-seeking behavior, \ncauses of problems, and approaches to treatment.\
      \ Similarly, in some cultures, there may be strong beliefs \nabout the role\
      \ of the family in the treatment of mental illness, substance misuse, or both;\
      \ those beliefs may \nneed to be accounted for when treatment planning. \nSource:\
      \ Healey et al. (2017). \nConclusion \n \nTo effectively fill practice gaps\
      \ and more comprehensively address the widespread problem of unmet \nCOD treatment\
      \ needs, behavioral health service providers and programs need to recognize\
      \ groups who \nhave been historically underserved. The recovery community is\
      \ diverse, and counselors may need to \nthink outside of the box in adapting\
      \ traditional techniques and perspectives to better meet the \nindividual needs\
      \ of all clients. Using a cookie-cutter approach for all clients in all settings\
      \ increases the \nlikelihood of improper diagnosis and treatment and is inconsistent\
      \ with expert guidance on providing \ncomprehensive, person-centered, recovery-oriented\
      \ care."

      Chapter 7—Treatment Models and Settings for \nPeople With Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \  \n(For Counselors, Other Treatment/Service Providers, \nSupervisors, and\
      \ Administrators) \nOf the 9.1 million adults who had CODs in 2018, approximately\
      \ half (51 percent) received no treatment \nat all, and only 8 percent received\
      \ care for both conditions (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and \nQuality,\
      \ 2019). What happens to people with CODs who enter traditional SUD treatment\
      \ settings? What \ncan counselors, other providers, supervisors, and administrators\
      \ do to help people with CODs more \nsuccessfully access needed services? How\
      \ can programs provide the best possible services to clients? \nWhat treatment\
      \ options are available, and to what extent are they supported by science? This\
      \ chapter \nseeks to answer these and other important questions about the management\
      \ of co-occurring mental \nillness and addiction. \nThis chapter examines treatment\
      \ models (e.g., integrated care, assertive community treatment [ACT], \nintensive\
      \ case management [ICM], mutual support and peer-based programs) and treatment\
      \ settings \n(e.g., therapeutic communities [TCs], outpatient and residential\
      \ care, acute care and other medical \nsettings) for clients with CODs. It opens\
      \ with an overview of general COD treatment considerations, \nincluding types\
      \ of programs, levels of service (and matching clients to appropriate levels),\
      \ episodes of \ntreatment, integrated versus nonintegrated treatment, culturally\
      \ competent services, and barriers to \ncare. The bulk of the material then\
      \ focuses on three areas: treatment models, treatment settings, and \npharmacotherapy.\
      \ Specific interventions, like cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT), behavioral\
      \ therapy, \nmultidimensional family therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy,\
      \ are beyond the scope of this \nKey Messages \nCo-occurring disorders (CODs)\
      \ are undertreated conditions that exact a serious toll on both the individuals\
      \ living \nwith them as well as on their families, caregivers, and society as\
      \ a whole. Early and effective treatments offer \npeople the opportunity to\
      \ live fulfilling, healthy, productive lives. \nAvailable treatment models work\
      \ by leveraging education, support, resources, and other services drawn from\
      \ \nmultiple sources, such as collaborating healthcare professionals across\
      \ primary care service, mental health \nservices, and substance use disorder\
      \ (SUD) treatment; mutual support programs; professionals in the recovery \n\
      community; and peer recovery support specialists.  \nTreatment providers should\
      \ not operate in silos nor should they use treatments in isolation. The best\
      \ way to \nserve people with CODs is to offer services and programs that are\
      \ integrated, comprehensive, person-centered, \nand recovery-oriented in their\
      \ structure, milieu, and practice. \nIt is vital that counselors and programs\
      \ provide effective interventions across multiple settings because people \n\
      with mental disorders and SUDs often fluctuate across levels of care, and this\
      \ should not be a barrier to \nreceiving needed evidence-based services. \n\
      Although psychosocial services are often a cornerstone of interventions for\
      \ CODs, counselors working with this \npopulation should be familiar with medication\
      \ treatment, as there are many effective pharmacotherapies \navailable to help\
      \ people reduce at least some of their symptoms and make appreciable gains in\
      \ functioning."

      Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP), as readers should already possess a basic\
      \ understanding of and \nworking familiarity with these commonly used SUD treatments;\
      \ rather, the material is focused on \ndescribing the models and settings in\
      \ which such interventions are provided.  \nRegarding pharmacotherapy, the chapter\
      \ is not intended to offer exhaustive guidance on medication for \nCODs, and\
      \ prescribers are not the intended primary audience of this chapter. However,\
      \ counselors and \nother providers working with people who have CODs will encounter\
      \ people taking medication and thus \nneed to become familiar with medication\
      \ names, side effects, and warnings about harmful interactions \n(especially\
      \ with alcohol) and other adverse consequences. \nSeveral examples of program\
      \ models designed to serve COD populations are included throughout this \nchapter,\
      \ as are Advice to the Counselor boxes to provide readers who have basic backgrounds\
      \ with the \nmost immediate practical guidance for implementing various program\
      \ models in different treatment \nsettings. To an extent, this chapter builds\
      \ on the programmatic perspectives of Chapter 8 by discussing \nhow to design\
      \ and implement programs in various settings. Administrators will benefit from\
      \ reviewing \nthis information but should also be sure to read Chapter 8 for\
      \ additional information about workforce \nhiring, training, and retention.\
      \  \nTreatment Overview \nTreatment Programs  \nA mental health program offers\
      \ an organized array of services and interventions focused on treating \nmental\
      \ disorders, providing acute stabilization or ongoing treatment. These programs\
      \ exist in various \nsettings, like traditional outpatient mental health centers\
      \ (e.g., psychosocial rehabilitation programs, \noutpatient clinics) or more\
      \ intensive inpatient treatment units. Many such programs treat significant\
      \ \nnumbers of individuals with CODs. Programs more advanced in treating people\
      \ with CODs may offer \nvarious interventions for SUDs (e.g., motivational interviewing,\
      \ SUD counseling, skills training) in the \ncontext of the ongoing mental health\
      \ services. \nAn SUD treatment program offers an organized array of services\
      \ and interventions focused on treating \nSUDs, providing both stabilization\
      \ and ongoing treatment. SUD treatment programs more advanced in \ntreating\
      \ people with CODs may offer a variety of interventions for mental disorders\
      \ (e.g., symptom \nmanagement training, psychopharmacology,) in the context\
      \ of the ongoing SUD treatment. \nProgram Types \nThe American Society of Addiction\
      \ Medicine (ASAM; Mee-Lee et al., 2013) describes three types of \nservice programs\
      \ for people with CODs: \n• \nCo-occurring–capable (COC) programs are SUD treatment\
      \ programs that mainly focus on SUDs but \ncan also treat patients with subthreshold\
      \ or diagnosable but stable mental disorders (Mee-Lee et al., \n2013). These\
      \ programs may offer mental health services onsite or by referral. COC programs\
      \ in \nmental health focus mainly on mental disorders but can treat patients\
      \ with subthreshold or \ndiagnosable but stable SUDs (Mee-Lee et al., 2013).\
      \ COC programs have addiction counselors onsite \nor available through referral.\
      \ \n• \nCo-occurring–enhanced programs have a higher level of integration of\
      \ SUD treatment and mental \nhealth services, staff trained to recognize the\
      \ signs and symptoms of both disorders, and \ncompetence in providing integrated\
      \ treatment for mental disorders and SUDs at the same time."

      • \nComplexity capable programs are designed to meet the needs of individuals\
      \ (and their families) \nwith multiple complex conditions that extend beyond\
      \ just CODs. Physical and psychosocial \nconditions and treatment areas of focus\
      \ often include chronic medical illnesses (e.g., HIV and other \ninfectious\
      \ diseases), trauma, legal matters, housing difficulties, criminal justice system\
      \ involvement, \nunemployment, education difficulties, childcare or parenting\
      \ difficulties, and cognitive dysfunctions. \nLevels of Service \nBecause mental\
      \ disorders and SUDs are complex and vary in their severity and consequences,\
      \ a wide \nrange of levels of service are needed, from high-intensity inpatient\
      \ medical service to periodic \noutpatient treatment. Not all people with CODs\
      \ will require the full continuum of services, and not all \nclients will move\
      \ through levels of care in a linear fashion. Clients can transition to and\
      \ from greater \nand lower intensity services and should be offered services\
      \ based on clinical need (e.g., symptom \nseverity, functional ability, person’s\
      \ overall level of stability) and stage of change. \nThe Level of Care Utilization\
      \ System (LOCUS; American Association of Community Psychiatrists, 2016) \ndescribes\
      \ six major domains of service levels for people with CODs:  \n1. Recovery Maintenance\
      \ / Health Management  \n2. Low Intensity Community Based Services \n3. High\
      \ Intensity Community Based Services  \n4. Medically Monitored Non-Residential\
      \ Services \n5. Medically Monitored Residential Services \n6. Medically Managed\
      \ Residential Services  \nChapter 3 further addresses levels of care, including\
      \ services/populations associated with each.   \nTreatment Matching to Levels\
      \ of Service Using the Quadrants of Care \nEffective treatment matching is an\
      \ essential component of quality care for people with CODs that \nbenefits the\
      \ healthcare system as a whole. Treatment matching not only ensures clients\
      \ receive the \nappropriate type and dose of service needed, it can help reduce\
      \ unnecessary lengths of stay for \nresidential treatment and helps reserve\
      \ use of costly healthcare resources for those who truly require \ncomplex interventions.\
      \ The widely used Four Quadrant Model (Ries, 1993; Exhibit 7.1) provides a \n\
      framework for treatment decision making and prioritizing service needs for clients\
      \ with CODs based on \nsymptom/disorder severity. It has good concurrent and\
      \ predictive validity (McDonell et al., 2012).\n\n[Page 217]\nTIP 42, Substance\
      \ Use Disorder Treatment for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020\
      \ \nChapter 7—Treatment Models and Settings for People With Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \ \n \nPage 189 \nUnder this conceptualization, clients are categorized accordingly:\
      \ \n• \nCategory I: Less severe mental disorder/less severe SUD \n• \nCategory\
      \ II: More severe mental disorder/less severe SUD \n• \nCategory III: Less severe\
      \ mental disorder/more severe SUD \n• \nCategory IV: More severe mental disorder/more\
      \ severe SUD \nFor a more detailed description of each quadrant and how to integrate\
      \ treatment matching into the \nassessment process using the Four Quadrant Model,\
      \ see Chapter 3.  \nEpisodes of Treatment \nAn individual with CODs can participate\
      \ in recurrent episodes of treatment involving acute stabilization \n(e.g.,\
      \ crisis intervention, detoxification, psychiatric hospitalization) and specific\
      \ ongoing treatment (e.g., \nmental-health–supported housing, day treatment\
      \ for mental illness, or residential treatment for SUDs). \nCounselors should\
      \ recognize the reality that clients engage in a series of treatment episodes,\
      \ as many \nindividuals with CODs progress gradually through repeated involvement\
      \ in treatment. \nIntegrated Versus Nonintegrated Treatment \nProviders generally\
      \ treat CODs in one of three ways (Morisano, Babor, & Robaina, 2014): \n1. Sequential\
      \ or serial treatment, in which the client is treated for one disorder at a\
      \ time. This has \nbeen the historic approach, but its effectiveness is dubious\
      \ and may lead to worse outcomes given \nthat, in some conditions, treatment\
      \ of one disorder can worsen symptoms of the other (e.g., \nexposure therapy\
      \ for a client with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might lead to anxiety\
      \ and \ndistress and subsequent alcohol use as a form of coping). \n2. Simultaneous\
      \ or parallel treatment, wherein the client is treated for both disorders but\
      \ by separate \nproviders and in separate systems. Although an improvement over\
      \ sequential treatment, this \napproach does not lead to collaborative, comprehensive\
      \ care. \n3. Integrated treatment, which is the preferred method because it\
      \ addresses all of a client’s diagnoses \nand symptoms within one service system/agency/program\
      \ and through a single team of providers \nExhibit 7.1. The Four Quadrants of\
      \ Care"

      \ \nneeds” (Office of Minority Health, 2018). Treatment providers should view\
      \ clients with CODs and their \ntreatment in the context of their language,\
      \ culture, ethnicity, geographic area, socioeconomic status, \ngender, age,\
      \ sexual orientation, religion, spirituality, and physical/cognitive disabilities.\
      \  \nCultural factors that may have an impact on treatment include heritage,\
      \ history and experience, beliefs, \ntraditions, values, customs, behaviors,\
      \ institutions, and ways of communicating. The client’s culture may \ninclude\
      \ distinctive ways of understanding disease or disorder, including mental disorders\
      \ and SUDs, \nwhich the provider needs to understand. Referencing a model of\
      \ disease that is familiar to the client can \nhelp communication and enhance\
      \ treatment. The counselor acquires cultural knowledge by becoming \naware of\
      \ the cultural factors that are important to a particular racial/ethnic group\
      \ or client. \nClients, not counselors, define what is culturally relevant to\
      \ them. Making assumptions, however well \nintentioned, about the client’s cultural\
      \ identity can possibly damage the relationship with a client. For \nexample,\
      \ a client of Hispanic origin may be a third-generation U.S. citizen, fully\
      \ acculturated, who feels \nlittle or no connection with her Hispanic heritage.\
      \ A counselor who assumes this client shares the beliefs \nand values of many\
      \ Hispanic cultures would be making an erroneous generalization. Similarly,\
      \ it is \nhelpful to remember that all of us represent multiple cultures. Clients\
      \ are more than their racial/ethnic \nidentities. A 20-year-old African-American\
      \ man from the rural south may identify, to some extent, with \nyouth, rural\
      \ south, or African-American cultural elements—or might, instead, identify more\
      \ strongly \nwith another cultural element that is not readily apparent, such\
      \ as his faith. Counselors are advised to \nopen a respectful dialog with clients\
      \ around the cultural elements that have significance to them. \nFor discussion\
      \ of cultural competence in SUD treatment, see TIP 59, improving cultural competence\
      \ \n(SAMHSA, 2014a). Chapter 6 addresses cultural competency for counselors\
      \ whose clients have CODs. \nBarriers to Treatment \nPeople with CODs usually\
      \ have extensive treatment needs, which unfortunately often go unmet. Among\
      \ \nthe approximately 8.5 million U.S. adults ages 18 and older with a past-year\
      \ SUD and any mental illness \nin 2018, less than 10 percent received treatment\
      \ for both disorders (Center for Behavioral Health \nStatistics and Quality,\
      \ 2019). Similarly, from 2008 to 2014, 52 percent of people with CODs received\
      \ \nneither mental health services nor SUD treatment in the prior year (Han\
      \ et al., 2017). People might \navoid pursuing treatment given lack of affordability,\
      \ not knowing where to access treatment, and low \nperceived treatment need\
      \ (e.g., not feeling ready to stop using substances, feeling like they could\
      \ \nhandle mental illness on their own) (Han et al., 2017). Other common obstacles\
      \ to accessing and \nbenefiting from COD treatment include (Priester et al.,\
      \ 2016):"

      \ about these groups and how to adapt services to their needs \nin Chapter 6.\
      \ \nReducing Barriers to Care: What Can Counselors and Administrators Do? \n\
      • Use person-centered approaches in assessing and treating clients with CODs.\
      \ Consider factors such as: \n− The client’s gender, age, race/ethnicity, or\
      \ other demographic characteristic that could affect how the \nclient experiences\
      \ his or her illnesses and treatment. \n− The client’s cultural background,\
      \ including birth status (i.e., native born vs. immigrant). \n− The client’s\
      \ degree of acculturation and acculturation stress. \n− The client’s history\
      \ of trauma. \n− The client’s current functional status (including housing and\
      \ educational/vocational status). \n− Whether the client is experiencing any\
      \ cognitive disabilities because of her or her diagnoses (particularly \nif\
      \ the person has a psychotic disorder). \n− The interaction style to which the\
      \ person best responds (e.g., Direct? Nonconfrontational?). \n• Consider offering\
      \ harm-reduction treatments in addition to abstinence-based services. Programs\
      \ that limit \nthemselves to abstinence-only treatments may fail to engage and\
      \ retain clients who are not ready to stop \nsubstance use altogether but are\
      \ otherwise amenable to treatment. \n• Offer informal pretreatment services\
      \ for people who are awaiting intake/appointments. \n• Adapt services to the\
      \ logistical demands facing clients. For instance: \n− When possible, offer\
      \ appointments throughout the week and at various times (including before and\
      \ after \nnormal business hours to accommodate people who work or attend school\
      \ full time).  \n− Use remote services (e.g., telehealth) to reach and engage\
      \ clients who are immobile or live at a distance."

      • Make integrated care a priority. Programs that offer comprehensive services\
      \ that work to simultaneously \naddress all of a client’s needs, using the same\
      \ set of providers, are more likely to keep clients engaged and \nparticipating\
      \ in treatment than ones that are fragmented. Treating substance use and mental\
      \ disorders in \nisolation hinders counselors’ ability to help clients address\
      \ all aspects of functioning and disability, including \ntheir housing status,\
      \ medication needs, family relationships, and more. These factors can become\
      \ reasons for \ntreatment dropout and require attention.  \n• Use a staged-approach\
      \ to interventions (i.e., engagement, persuasion, active treatment, relapse\
      \ prevention) \nthat is tailored to clients’ readiness to change and is flexible,\
      \ as clients often move through stages in a \nnonlinear fashion. Motivational\
      \ interviewing can help determine clients’ readiness for interventions and aids\
      \ \nin the creation of personally meaningful and realistic treatment goals.\
      \ \n• Use assertive community outreach, such as ICM and ACT services, as these\
      \ foster therapeutic alliance and \nreduce practical/logistical barriers to\
      \ treatment access and adherence (e.g., providing in-home services). \n• Emphasize\
      \ COD leadership within programs. Programs need to have a director on staff\
      \ whose primary job is \nto oversee COD programming, services, fidelity, and\
      \ staff competency/training. \nSources: Priester et al. (2016); SAMHSA (2009a).\
      \ \n \nResource Alert: Finding Quality Treatment for Substance Use Disorders\
      \ \nSAMHSA’s fact sheet helps people with SUDs make decisions about quality\
      \ services and learn where to locate \nSUD treatment facilities and providers\
      \ (https://store.samhsa.gov/system/files/pep18-treatment-loc.pdf). \nTreatment\
      \ Models  \nIntegrated Care \nIntegrated interventions are specific treatment\
      \ strategies or techniques in which interventions for CODs \nare combined in\
      \ a single session/interaction or in a series of interactions/multiple sessions.\
      \ Integrated \ninterventions can include a wide range of techniques. Some examples\
      \ include: \n• \nIntegrated screening and assessment processes. \n• \nDual recovery\
      \ mutual support group meetings. \n• \nDual recovery groups (in which recovery\
      \ skills for both disorders are discussed). \n• \nMotivational enhancement interventions\
      \ (individual or group) that address both mental and \nsubstance use problems.\
      \ \n• \nGroup interventions for people with the triple diagnosis of mental disorder,\
      \ SUD, and another \nproblem, such as a chronic medical condition (e.g., HIV),\
      \ trauma, homelessness, or criminality. \n• \nCombined psychopharmacological\
      \ interventions, in which a person receives medication designed to \nreduce\
      \ addiction to or cravings for substances as well as medication for a mental\
      \ disorder. \nIntegrated interventions can be part of a single program or can\
      \ be used in multiple program settings. \nIntegrated Care: Partnerships for\
      \ Pharmacotherapy \nRecovery-oriented systems of care foster both integrated\
      \ care for the simultaneous treatment of mental illness \nand SUDs but also\
      \ foster critical processes, like active linkages, warm handoffs, and ongoing\
      \ follow-up from one \nstage or environment of care to the next. This is particularly\
      \ important for people with SMI because these \ndiagnoses tend to require lifelong\
      \ monitoring and management of potentially debilitating symptoms. If a client\
      \ \nis not responding to a nonpharmacological treatment, consider whether: \
      \ \n• An alternate treatment or service (e.g., another psychotherapy, medication,\
      \ mutual support) is needed."

      Empirical Evidence of Integrated Care for CODs \nThe integrated model of care\
      \ is considered a best practice for serving people with CODs. (See \n“Resource\
      \ Alert: Implementing Integrated Care for People with CODs.”) It has been linked\
      \ to many \ndesirable substance-, psychiatric-, functional-, and service-related\
      \ outcomes, including decreased \nsubstance use and abstinence (Drake, Bond,\
      \ et al., 2016; Flanagan et al., 2016; Kelly & Daley, 2013; \nMcGovern et al.,\
      \ 2015; Ruglass et al., 2017; Schumm & Gore, 2016; Sterling, Chi, & Hinman,\
      \ 2011); \nimproved mental functioning (Alterman, Xie, & Meier, 2011; Drake,\
      \ Bond et al., 2016; Flanagan et al., \n2016; Kelly & Daley, 2013; McGovern,\
      \ Lambert-Harris, Ruglass, et al., 2017); decreased emergency \ndepartment (ED)\
      \ visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and healthcare costs (Morse & Bride, 2017);\
      \ gains in \nindependent housing and competitive employment (Drake, Bond, et\
      \ al., 2016); improved life satisfaction \nor quality of life (Drake, Bond,\
      \ et al., 2016); and greater client satisfaction (Schulte, Meier, & Stirling,\
      \ \n2011). \nIntegrated COD care can be effective across different settings\
      \ and in diverse populations, including: \n• \nIn residential facilities (McKee,\
      \ Harris, & Cormier, 2013). Here, integrated care has been associated \nwith\
      \ significant reductions in mental illness symptoms, improvements in COD-related\
      \ knowledge \nand skills, increased self-esteem, and good client satisfaction—even\
      \ among clients with complex, \nchallenging clinical and psychosocial histories\
      \ (e.g., presence of PTSD, polysubstance misuse, \nchildhood maltreatment, adolescent\
      \ substance misuse, unstable housing, reliance on public \nassistance, being\
      \ unemployed or out of school).  \n• \nIn a variety of criminal justice-related\
      \ settings, such as prebooking diversion programs, drug or \nmental health courts,\
      \ in jails or prisons, and as a part of community release (Peters et al., 2017;\
      \ \nRojas & Peters, 2015). Integrated COD care has been linked to desirable\
      \ outcomes such as improved \npsychiatric symptoms, reduced substance use, and\
      \ decreased rates of reoffending and recidivism. \n• \nWith people experiencing\
      \ homelessness (Polcin, 2016; Smelson et al., 2016). In these populations, \n\
      integrated COD treatment can help reduce substance use and mental illness symptoms\
      \ while, \ndepending on the housing service model used, also increasing housing\
      \ stability and retention. \n \nResource Alert: Implementing Integrated Care\
      \ for People With CODs \n• SAMHSA’s Integrated Treatment for Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \ Evidence-Based Practices KIT  \n• The treatment is a good match the client’s\
      \ level of service need. \n• The treatment is a good match for the client’s\
      \ readiness for change.  \nGiven that medication often plays a role in helping\
      \ people with SMI achieve and sustain recovery, it may be \nworth considering\
      \ whether referral of clients with CODs (and especially SMI) to a provider qualified\
      \ to assess for \npharmacologic options is needed.  \nBehavioral health programs\
      \ should encourage the provider making that referral to do a warm handoff and\
      \ \nfollow up with the client in 2 to 4 weeks to determine how well the medication\
      \ is working and whether the \nclient has any concerns. If pharmacotherapy is\
      \ being provided offsite (e.g., methadone clinic), the provider will \nneed\
      \ to obtain the client’s written consent to discuss with the prescribing provider\
      \ how the client is faring, \nwhether medication seems to be effective, and\
      \ whether any nonpharmacologic treatments or services need to \nbe tailored\
      \ in any way as a result of the client taking medication.  \nFor more guidance\
      \ about medication treatments for CODs, see the section “Pharmacotherapy” at\
      \ the end of \nthis chapter. Also see the text box “Knowing When To Refer for\
      \ Medication Management” within that section."

      \ Practices. Integrated Dual Disorder Treatment Clinical Guide \n(www.centerforebp.case.edu/client-files/pdf/iddtclinicalguide.pdf)\
      \  \nACT \nDeveloped in the 1970s by Stein and Test (Stein & Test, 1980; Test,\
      \ 1992) in Madison, Wisconsin, for \nclients with SMI, the ACT model was designed\
      \ as an intensive, long-term approach to providing services \nfor those who\
      \ were reluctant to engage in traditional treatment approaches and who required\
      \ \nsignificant outreach and engagement activities. ACT has evolved and been\
      \ modified to address the \nneeds of individuals with mental disorders (especially\
      \ SMI) and co-occurring SUDs (De Witte et al., 2014; \nFries & Rosen, 2011;\
      \ Manuel, Covell, Jackson, & Essock, 2011; Young, Barrett, Engelhardt, & Moore,\
      \ \n2014). \nProgram Model \nACT programs typically use intensive outreach activities,\
      \ active and continued engagement with clients, \nand a high intensity of services.\
      \ Multidisciplinary teams, including specialists in key areas of treatment,\
      \ \nprovide a range of services to clients. Members typically include mental\
      \ health and SUD treatment \ncounselors, case managers, nursing staff, and psychiatric\
      \ consultants. The ACT team provides the client \nwith practical assistance\
      \ in life management as well as direct treatment, often within the client’s\
      \ home \nenvironment, and remains responsible and available 24 hours a day (SAMHSA,\
      \ 2008). The team has the \ncapacity to intensify services as needed and may\
      \ make several visits each week (or even per day) to a \nclient. Caseloads are\
      \ kept smaller than other community-based treatment models to accommodate the\
      \ \nintensity of service provision (a 1:10 staff­to-client ratio is typical).\
      \ \nACT Treatment Activities and Interventions \nExamples of ACT interventions\
      \ include (Bond & Drake, 2015; SAMHSA, 2008): \n• \nOutreach/engagement. To\
      \ involve and sustain clients in treatment, counselors and administrators \n\
      must develop multiple ways to attract, engage, and re-engage clients. Expectations\
      \ for clients are \noften minimal to nonexistent, especially in programs serving\
      \ very resistant or hard-to-reach clients. \n• \nPractical assistance in life\
      \ management. This feature incorporates case management activities that \nfacilitate\
      \ linkages with support services in the community, including employment services.\
      \ Whereas \nthe role of a counselor in the ACT approach includes standard counseling,\
      \ in many instances \nsubstantial time also is spent on life management and\
      \ behavioral management matters. \n• \nTangible support. For some clients, especially\
      \ with SMI, help with logistical and everyday functional \nneeds is critical\
      \ to ensuring treatment access, engagement, participation, and retention. Supportive\
      \ \ncare can include assistance with housing, benefits/insurance, transportation,\
      \ and childcare. \n• \nCounseling. The nature of the counseling activity is\
      \ matched to the client’s motivation and readiness \nfor treatment. Interventions\
      \ may also involve family and other support networks as appropriate. \n• \n\
      Crisis assessment and intervention. This is provided during extended service\
      \ hours (24 hours a day, \nideally through a system of on-call rotation). \n\
      Nine Essential Features of ACT \n1. Services that are provided in the community\
      \ rather than in clinic offices \n2. Assertive engagement with active outreach"

      \ Key Modifications for Integrating COD Treatment \nAs applied to CODs, the\
      \ goals of the ACT model are to engage the client in a helping relationship,\
      \ to \nassist in meeting basic needs (e.g., housing), to stabilize the client\
      \ in the community, and to provide \ndirect and integrated SUD treatment and\
      \ mental health services. The standard ACT model as developed \nby Test (1992)\
      \ has been modified to include treatment for people who have SUD as well as\
      \ SMI (Bond & \nDrake, 2015) and to address common needs within the COD community\
      \ (e.g., housing needs, criminal \njustice-related needs). Key elements in this\
      \ evolution have been (Neumiller et al., 2009): \n• \nOffering direct SUD interventions\
      \ for clients with CODs (often through the inclusion of an addiction \ncounselor\
      \ on the multidisciplinary team) or, if not possible, referral to SUD treatment.\
      \  \n• \nUsing a COD-based model of care that focuses on specialized services,\
      \ a nonconfrontational and \nsupportive milieu, and recovery-oriented stages\
      \ of care. \n• \nProviding higher intensity of services via “mini teams” of\
      \ case managers, mental health service and \nSUD treatment providers, and consumer\
      \ advocates. \n• \nAdapting ACT to support housing placement, such as: \n− Integrating\
      \ a Housing First (HF) model of supportive permanent housing. \n− Including\
      \ outreach workers and assistants to give providers more time with clients.\
      \ \n− Placing time limits on services to encourage client engagement in interventions\
      \ that support \nindependent living (like employment and vocational training).\
      \ \n− Monitoring psychiatric symptoms and medication response. \n− Offering\
      \ SUD treatment/education. \n− Adding residential housing as a temporary solution\
      \ for clients in the process of obtaining \nindependent stable housing. \n•\
      \ \nModifying for criminal justice settings/populations (Lamberti et al., 2017;\
      \ Landess & Holoyda, 2017; \nMarquant, Sabbe, Van Nuffel, & Goethals, 2016)\
      \ by collaborating with and including criminal justice \nagencies and professionals\
      \ (e.g., probation officers) in the ACT team; using court sanctions or other\
      \ \nlegal leverage to increase motivation and treatment participation/retention;\
      \ applying forensic \nrehabilitation strategies to target factors associated\
      \ with reoffending and recidivism; and educating \nand training providers in\
      \ unique aspects of criminal justice–mental health collaboration. \nSUD treatment\
      \ strategies are related to the client’s motivation and readiness for treatment\
      \ and include: \n• \nEnhancing motivation (for example, through use of motivational\
      \ interviewing). \n• \nCognitive–behavioral skills for relapse prevention. \n\
      3. Holistic approaches that address clients’ symptoms, medication needs, housing\
      \ difficulties, financial \nneeds, and other areas of daily living (e.g., transportation)\
      \ \n4. A multidisciplinary team of mental health service and SUD treatment professionals\
      \ (e.g., counselors, \npsychiatrists, social workers, psychiatric and mental\
      \ health nurses [specialty practice registered nurses], \ncase managers) \n\
      5. Providing clients with services directly rather than utilizing referrals\
      \ to other professionals \n6. Integrated services that are tailored to comprehensively\
      \ and simultaneously address a client’s full range \nof clinical, functional,\
      \ vocational, social, and everyday living needs \n7. A low client–provider ratio\
      \ (usually about 10 clients per provider) \n8. Continuous care, including 24/7\
      \ emergency services \n9. Focus on helping to support long-term rather than\
      \ acute recovery \nSource: Bond & Drake (2015)."

      • \nMutual support programming, including peer recovery supports to strengthen\
      \ recovery. \n• \nPsychoeducational instruction about addictive disorders. \n\
      For clients uninterested in abstinence, motivational approaches to ACT can highlight\
      \ the detrimental \neffects of substance use on their lives and those of the\
      \ people around them. Therapeutic interventions \nare then modified to meet\
      \ the client’s current stage of change and receptivity. Learn more in Chapter\
      \ 5 \nand in TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder\
      \ Treatment (SAMHSA, 2019d). \nPopulations Served \nWhen modified as described\
      \ previously for CODs, the ACT model is capable of including clients with \n\
      greater mental and functional disabilities who do not fit well into many traditional\
      \ treatment \napproaches. The characteristics of those served by ACT programs\
      \ for CODs include people with an SUD \nand mental illness, SMI (e.g., intractable\
      \ depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic \ndisorders),\
      \ serious functional impairments, avoidance of or poor response to traditional\
      \ outpatient \nmental health services and SUD treatment, homelessness, criminal\
      \ justice involvement, or some \ncombination thereof. Subsequently, clients\
      \ targeted for ACT often are high users of expensive service \ndelivery systems\
      \ (EDs and hospitals) as immediate resources for mental health and SUD services.\
      \ \nEmpirical Evidence for ACT \nThe ACT model has been researched widely as\
      \ a means of providing community-based services to \npeople with chronic mental\
      \ illness. The low caseload ratio and delivery of community-based services,\
      \ \ncombined with intensive attention, structure, monitoring, and outreach,\
      \ are beneficial for people with \nSMI, as SMI is typically unstable and highly\
      \ disabling. For instance, a randomized trial of integrated ACT \nversus standard\
      \ case management found ACT significantly improved medication adherence among\
      \ \npeople with psychotic disorders and SUDs over a 3-year period (Manuel et\
      \ al., 2011).  \nResearch on ACT for individuals with CODs has been somewhat\
      \ limited compared to research on ACT for \nmental illness alone, and findings\
      \ to date have been mixed. ACT demonstrated superiority to standard \nclinical\
      \ case management in reducing alcohol use and incarcerations among people with\
      \ CODs plus \nantisocial personality disorder (PD) but not people with CODs\
      \ without antisocial PD (ASPD; Frisman et \nal., 2009). However, this study\
      \ used a small sample size and lacks generalizability. ACT combined with \n\
      integrated dual disorder treatment (including from an addiction specialist)\
      \ for people with SMI and SUD \n(Morse, York, Dell, Blanco, & Birchmier, 2017)\
      \ improved symptoms of SUDs and mental illness, including \ndecreasing alcohol\
      \ use but not drug use or overall substance use. In a SAMHSA grant-funded program\
      \ \nthat provided ACT and integrated COD treatment services to people experiencing\
      \ chronic homelessness \n(Young et al., 2014), ACT was associated with improved\
      \ housing stability, global mental health, past-\nmonth depression and anxiety,\
      \ client self-esteem and decision-making abilities, treatment satisfaction,\
      \ \nand treatment engagement but not self-reported alcohol or illicit drug use.\
      \ In a review of outpatient \ntreatments for schizophrenia and SUD (De Witte\
      \ et al., 2014), integrated ACT outperformed treatment \nResource Alert: Implementing\

      as usual in terms of substance use, hospitalizations, stable housing, and negative\
      \ and disorganized \nsymptoms of psychosis but was no better than integrated\
      \ case management at reducing substance use \nand improving psychiatric symptom\
      \ severity.  \nThese mixed findings are likely due in part to ACT’s unproven\
      \ ability to ameliorate SUDs. A review of \nrandomized clinical trials of ACT\
      \ for substance misuse (Fries & Rosen, 2011) found that it helped reduce \n\
      alcohol and drug use over time when supplemented with SUD treatment. But effects\
      \ were small, and \nreductions in substance use were typically no better than\
      \ those from other treatment approaches (e.g., \ncase management). This suggests\
      \ that traditional ACT is likely not an effective addiction management \ntool\
      \ on its own but when used with adjunctive SUD treatment (e.g., inclusion of\
      \ addiction counselors, \nuse of contingency management for abstinence) may\
      \ be as effective as case management at improving \nsubstance-related outcomes.\
      \ Nevertheless, based on the weight of evidence, ACT is a recommended \ntreatment\
      \ model for clients with CODs, especially when used as an integrated treatment\
      \ with adjunct \nsubstance use services. \nExamples of ACT Programs \nThe University\
      \ of Washington Program for ACT \nThe University of Washington’s Program for\
      \ ACT (PACT) was established to provide outreach-based \nservices to clients\
      \ with mental and addiction needs, particularly people with SMI and SUDs. Washington\
      \ \nPACT Teams carry a low caseload (1:10 provider-client ratio) and use high-intensity,\
      \ multidisciplinary \nservices (e.g., 24/7 care, treatments predominantly offered\
      \ in the community), including CBT, SUD \ntreatment, family psychoeducation,\
      \ motivational interviewing, pharmacotherapy, relapse prevention, \ncrisis management,\
      \ psychiatric rehabilitation, community outreach, social skills training, and\
      \ supported \neducation/employment services. The program currently has 15 teams\
      \ located throughout Washington \nState. Program reports indicate up to 60 percent\

      − Recovery assessment. \n− Strengths assessment. \n− Nicotine use. \n− Psychiatric\
      \ rehabilitation. \nMercy Maricopa ACT Program \nMercy Maricopa, an integrated\
      \ physical and behavioral health Medicaid managed care plan, offers an \nACT\
      \ program of 23 ACT teams (including 3 forensic ACT programs) specifically focused\
      \ on people with \nSMI. ACT Teams provides comprehensive, multidisciplinary\
      \ wraparound care including psychiatric and \nSUD treatment, medication management,\
      \ case management, social services, vocational rehabilitation, \nhousing and\
      \ vocational assistance, and peer support.  \nA healthcare analysis from 2018\
      \ (NORC, 2018) found that, pre–post enrollment in the ACT program, \nclients\
      \ incurred significantly lower overall facility costs (-$608 per member per\
      \ quarter), overall \nprofessional service costs (-$485), behavioral health\
      \ service costs (-$410), and total behavioral health \ncosts (-$808). Total\
      \ spending from pre- to postprogram participation decreased by $734 but was\
      \ not \nsignificant. Pharmacy expenditures were significantly higher following\
      \ ACT program participation \n(+$246). ACT clients had significantly less ED\
      \ utilization and fewer psychiatric hospitalizations from \nbaseline to postprogram\
      \ participation. Compared to a matched comparison group not participating in\
      \ \nthe ACT program, ACT clients had significantly lower rates of ED utilization.\
      \ \nICM \nThe earliest model of case management was primarily a brokerage model.\
      \ Linkages to services were \nbased on clients’ individual needs, but case managers\
      \ provided no formal clinical services. Over time, it \nbecame apparent that\
      \ providers could provide more effective case management services. Thus, clinical\
      \ \ncase management largely supplanted the brokerage model. ICM emerged as a\
      \ strategy in the late 1980s \nand early 1990s. It was designed as a thorough,\
      \ long-term service to assist clients with SMI (particularly \nthose with mental\
      \ and functional disabilities and a history of not adhering to prescribed outpatient\
      \ \ntreatment) by establishing and maintaining linkages with community-based\
      \ service providers. \nICM is not a precisely defined term but rather is used\
      \ in the literature to describe an alternative to both \ntraditional case management\
      \ and ACT. The goals of the ICM model are to engage individuals in a \ntrusting\
      \ relationship, assist in meeting their basic needs (e.g., housing), and help\
      \ them access and use \nbrokered services in the community. The fundamental\
      \ element of ICM is a low caseload per case \nmanager, which translates into\
      \ more intensive and consistent services for each client. TIP 27, \nComprehensive\
      \ Case Management for Substance Abuse Treatment (Center for Substance Abuse\
      \ \nTreatment [CSAT], 2000b), contains more information on the history of case\
      \ management, both how it \nhas developed to meet the needs of clients in SUD\
      \ treatment (including clients with CODs) and specific \nguidelines about how\
      \ to implement case management services. \nProgram Model \nICM programs typically\
      \ involve outreach and engagement activities, brokering of community-based \n\
      services, direct provision of some support/counseling services, and a higher\
      \ intensity of services than \nstandard case management. The intensive case\
      \ manager assists the client in selecting services, \nfacilitates access to\
      \ these services, and monitors the client’s progress through services provided\
      \ by \nothers (inside or outside the program structure or by a team). Client\
      \ roles in this model include serving \nas a partner in selecting treatment\
      \ components."

      In some instances, the ICM model uses multidisciplinary teams similar to ACT.\
      \ The composition of the \nICM team is determined by the resources available\
      \ in the agency implementing the programs. The team \noften includes a cluster-set\
      \ of case managers rather than the specialists prescribed as standard \ncomponents\
      \ of the treatment model. The ICM team may offer services provided by ACT teams,\
      \ including \npractical assistance in life management (e.g., housing) and some\
      \ direct counseling or other forms of \ntreatment. Caseloads are kept smaller\
      \ than those in other community-based treatment models \n(typically, the client:counselor\
      \ ratio ranges from 15:1 to 25:1) but larger than those in the ACT model. \n\
      Because the case management responsibilities are so wide ranging and require\
      \ a broad knowledge of \nlocal treatment services and systems, a typically trained\
      \ counselor may require some retraining or close, \ninstructive supervision\
      \ in order to serve effectively as a case manager. \nTreatment Activities and\
      \ Interventions \nExamples of ICM activities and interventions include: \n•\
      \ \nEngaging the client in an alliance to facilitate the process and connecting\
      \ the client with community-\nbased treatment programs. \n• \nAssessing needs,\
      \ identifying barriers to treatment, and facilitating access to treatment. \n\
      • \nOffering practical help with life management; facilitating linkages with\
      \ community support services. \n• \nMaking referrals to treatment programs offered\
      \ by others in the community; see also TIP 27 (CSAT, \n2000b) for guidance on\
      \ establishing linkages for service provision and interagency cooperation. \n\
      • \nAdvocating for the client with treatment providers and service delivery\
      \ systems. \n• \nMonitoring progress. \n• \nProviding counseling and support\
      \ to help the client maintain stability in the community. \n• \nCrisis intervention.\
      \ \n• \nAssisting in integrating treatment services by facilitating communication\
      \ between service providers. \nKey Modifications of ICM for CODs \nKey ICM modifications\
      \ from basic case management for clients with CODs include: \n• \nUsing direct\
      \ interventions for clients with CODs, such as enhancing motivation for treatment\
      \ and \ndiscussing the interactive effects of mental disorders and SUDs. \n\
      • \nMaking referrals to providers of integrated SUD treatment and mental health\
      \ services or, if \nintegrated services are not available or accessible, facilitating\
      \ communication between separate \nbrokered mental health service and SUD treatment\
      \ providers. \n• \nCoordinating with community-based services to support the\
      \ client’s involvement in mutual support \ngroups and outpatient treatment activities.\
      \ \nAdvice to Administrators: Treatment Principles From ICM \n• Select clients\
      \ with more mental/functional disabilities who are resistant to traditional\
      \ outpatient treatment.  \n• Use a low caseload per case manager to accommodate\
      \ more intensive services.  \n• Assist in meeting basic needs (e.g., housing).\
      \  \n• Facilitate access to and utilization of brokered community-based services.\
      \  \n• Provide long-term support, such as counseling services.  \n• Monitor\
      \ the client’s progress through services provided by others.  \n• Use multidisciplinary\
      \ teams."

      Empirical Evidence \nMost published literature on ICM has focused on mental\
      \ illness, with fewer U.S. studies examining SUD \nor CODs. ICM may help people\
      \ with SMI reduce hospitalizations, stay in treatment longer, and improve \n\
      social functioning. But many of these studies are considered to be of low quality\
      \ (e.g., small sample \nsizes, flawed methodology or study design), and findings\
      \ are not consistently better than those from \nstandard care or other non-ICM\
      \ approaches (Dieterich et al., 2017). Some researchers have reported \npositive\
      \ effects of ICM for SMI in terms of: \n• \nIncreasing social integration among\
      \ people in supported housing and acquisition of Section 8 \nhousing vouchers\
      \ (Tsai & Rosenheck, 2012). \n• \nImproving physical health (e.g., weight, blood\
      \ pressure) among veterans (Harrold et al., 2018). \n• \nReducing mental illness\
      \ hospitalizations (by 70 percent); average number of days hospitalized for\
      \ \nmental illness (by 75 percent); and average 30-day inpatient psychiatric\
      \ service costs, outpatient \npsychiatric service costs, and outpatient medical\
      \ service costs (Kolbasovsky, 2009).  \nStudies of ICM and substance use in\
      \ U.S. populations are tentatively positive, but the research is limited \n\
      in number and generalizability. In women with substance misuse receiving Temporary\
      \ Assistance for \nNeedy Families (Morgenstern et al., 2009), ICM was associated\
      \ with greater rates of short-term and \nlong-term abstinence and a greater\
      \ likelihood of being employed full time than did usual care (i.e., \nscreening\
      \ and referral). In a related study, Kuerbis, Neighbors, and Morgenstern (2011)\
      \ observed \nparadoxical moderating effects of depression on ICM-substance use\
      \ outcomes such that women with \nsubstance misuse and higher scores of depression\
      \ who participated in the ICM program had better SUD \ntreatment engagement\
      \ and fewer drinks per drinking days than women in the program with lower \n\
      scores of depression. Women with higher depression also exhibited higher or\
      \ equal rates of SUD \ntreatment attendance and percentage of days abstinent\
      \ than less-depressed women. Hence, the ICM \nprogram was effective at improving\
      \ addiction outcomes and may be especially so among women with \ncomorbid high\
      \ depression. \nRegarding CODs, ICM appears effective in specific populations\
      \ (e.g., veterans, people with housing \nneeds, individuals in the criminal\
      \ justice system), although it is unclear the magnitude of effect of these \n\
      programs and whether they are superior to ACT or other approaches. In military\
      \ veterans, a rural-based \nICM for people with and without CODs (Mohamed, 2013)\
      \ helped more people with CODs engage in \nrehabilitation, housing, vocational,\
      \ and addiction services than it did veterans without CODs. The ICM \nprogram\
      \ was associated with improvements in mental disorder symptoms, distress, quality\
      \ of life, \ntreatment satisfaction, income, and days employed; however, there\
      \ were no differences in any of these \nvariables between veterans with and\
      \ without CODs. Malte, Cox, and Saxon (2017) also examined \nveterans receiving\
      \ ICM but with a focus on promoting housing stability and addiction recovery.\
      \ Almost \n60 percent of program participants had a comorbid depressive disorder,\
      \ 43 percent PTSD, 31 percent an \nanxiety disorder, 21 percent a psychotic\
      \ disorder, and 19 percent a bipolar disorder. Over time, \nparticipants increased\
      \ their percent of days spent in their own home or in transitional housing;\
      \ \ndecreased days spent homeless or living with others; increased rates of\
      \ 30-day abstinence; and \nimproved their Addiction Severity Index (ASI) scores\
      \ (legal, drug, and psychiatric composite scales). \nHowever, none of these\
      \ improvements were significantly different from those observed in the control\
      \ \ncondition (a housing support group). Nevertheless, the addiction/housing\
      \ ICM program was associated \nwith more days spent in SUD treatment (almost\
      \ 53 days longer than controls), greater treatment \nparticipation, and higher\
      \ treatment satisfaction. Furthermore, the Northern Kentucky Female Offender\
      \ \nReentry Project (McDonald & Arlinghaus, 2014) examined ICM among incarcerated\
      \ women with SMI, \nSUDs, or both (78 percent had a CODs). Compared to women\
      \ who only participated in the program"

      \ to Benefit Homeless Individuals  \nSAMHSA’s Cooperative Agreement to Benefit\
      \ Homeless Individuals (CABHI) programs use integrated \napproaches, including\
      \ ICM, to address addiction, mental illness, medical, housing, and employment\
      \ \nneeds. Funding is administered as part of SAMHSA's Recovery Support Strategic\
      \ Initiative, with the \noverarching goal of helping people with SUDs, SMI,\
      \ or CODs reduce the experience of homelessness \n(e.g., via subsidized and\
      \ supportive housing). The program was initiated in 2011 to provide funding\
      \ to \npublic and nonprofit entities and was expanded in 2013 to offer funds\
      \ to help establish or enhance \nstatewide service infrastructure and planning.\
      \ It again expanded in 2016 to include a wider swatch of \ncommunities (including\
      \ tribal communities) and nonprofit organizations. Integrated services offered\
      \ by \nCABHI programs include community outreach; screening, assessment, and\
      \ treatment for addictions, \nmental illness, or both; peer recovery support\
      \ services; and ICM. \nThe Extended Hope Project in Yolo County, California,\
      \ is a CABHI recipient (2016–2019) offering \nintegrated treatments to improve\
      \ housing stability, behavioral and physical health, and criminal justice \n\
      status for people in Yolo County with CODs who are experiencing homelessness.\
      \ The program includes:  \n• \nA screening, assessment, and triage service to\
      \ link clients with outreach workers to assess clients for \nneeded services\
      \ and enroll them in case management. \n• \nAn ICM and treatment team, including\
      \ case managers, who responded to crisis needs, worked with \nclients on shared\
      \ treatment decision making, and helped develop tailored treatment plans; peer\
      \ \nrecovery support specialists, who provided mentorship, support, and education;\
      \ and an \nemployment specialist to aid with job placement. \n• \nCollaboration\
      \ with a housing navigator to help connect clients with permanent housing placement\
      \ \nand teach eviction prevention strategies. \nPathways to Housing, Inc.’s\
      \ HF Programs \nThe HF program uses the supportive permanent model (see Chapter\
      \ 6) to help people with CODs obtain \nstable housing and prevent future homelessness\
      \ (Tsemberis, 2010). Originally launched in New York City \nin 1992, programs\
      \ now also exist in Pennsylvania, Vermont, the District of Columbia, and Canada.\
      \ HF \nprograms do not require clients to achieve abstinence before enrolling\
      \ and instead integrate SUD and \nmental disorder treatment with housing support\
      \ services (e.g., ACT or ICM).  \nThe Tulsa Housing and Recovery Program, a\
      \ recipient of the SAMHSA Services in Supportive Housing 5-\nyear grant in 2009,\
      \ is a collaboration between community mental health centers and housing providers\
      \ \nthat offers SUD treatment, mental health services, and supportive housing\
      \ (via the HF model) to \nindividuals with CODs who are experiencing homelessness.\
      \ Integrated services and ICM are key \ncomponents of the program. From 2009\
      \ to 2013, the program reported numerous improved outcomes \n(Shinn & Brose,\
      \ 2017), including the following statistics: \n• \nHousing retention rate (i.e.,\
      \ continuously housed for 12 months or longer): 94 percent  \n• \n72 percent\
      \ of clients reduced their substance use at 6 months \n• \n70 percent scored\
      \ at minimal or no risk for substance misuse at 6 months"

      \ counseling \nDifferences Between ACT and ICM \nACT is more intensive than\
      \ most ICM approaches. The ACT emphasis is on developing a therapeutic \nalliance\
      \ with the client and delivery of service components in the client’s home, on\
      \ the street, or in \nprogram offices (based on the client’s preference). ACT\
      \ services are provided predominantly by the \nmultidisciplinary staff of the\
      \ ACT team, and the program often is located in the community (Bond & \nDrake,\
      \ 2015; Ellenhorn, 2015). Most ACT programs provide services 16 hours a day\
      \ on weekdays, 8 \nhours a day on weekends, plus on-call crisis intervention,\
      \ including visits to the client’s home at any \ntime, day or night, with the\
      \ capacity to make multiple visits to a client on any given day. Caseloads \n\
      usually are 10:1. ICM programs typically include fewer hours of direct treatment,\
      \ but they may include \n24­hour crisis intervention; the focus of ICM is on\
      \ brokering community-based services for the client. \nICM caseloads range up\
      \ to 25:1. \nThe ACT multidisciplinary team has shared responsibility for the\
      \ entire defined caseload of clients and \nmeets frequently (ideally, teams\
      \ meet daily) to ensure that all members are fully up-to-date on clinical \n\
      matters. Although team members may play different roles, all are familiar with\
      \ every client on the \ncaseload. The nature of ICM team functioning is not\
      \ as defined, and cohesion is not necessarily a focus \nof team functioning;\
      \ the ICM team can operate as a loose federation of independent case managers\
      \ or \nas a cohesive unit in a manner similar to ACT. Also, the ACT model can\
      \ include the clients’ family within \ntreatment services (White, McGrew, Salyers,\
      \ & Firmin, 2014), which is not always true for ICM models. \nICM most frequently\
      \ involves the coordination of services across different systems over extended\
      \ \nperiods of time, whereas ACT integrates and provides treatment for CODs\
      \ within the team. As a \nconsequence, advocacy with other providers is a major\
      \ component of ICM, but advocacy in ACT focuses \non ancillary services. The\
      \ ACT multidisciplinary team approach to treatment emphasizes providing"

      integrated treatment for clients with CODs directly, assuming that the team\
      \ members include both \nmental health and SUD treatment counselors and are\
      \ fully trained in both approaches. \nRecommendations for Extending ACT and\
      \ ICM in SUD Treatment Settings \nACT and ICM models translate easily to SUD\
      \ treatment. The consensus panel offers five \nrecommendations for successful\
      \ use of ACT and ICM in SUD treatment with clients who have CODs: \n1. Use ACT\
      \ and ICM for clients who require considerable supervision and support. ACT\
      \ is a treatment \nalternative for those clients with CODs who have a history\
      \ of sporadic adherence with continuing \ncare or outpatient services and who\
      \ require extended monitoring and supervision (e.g., medication \nmonitoring\
      \ or dispensing) and intensive onsite treatment supports to sustain their tenure\
      \ in the \ncommunity (e.g., criminal justice clients). For this subset of the\
      \ COD population, ACT provides \naccessible treatment supports without requiring\
      \ return to a residential setting. The typical ICM \nprogram is capable of providing\
      \ less intense levels of monitoring and supports, but can still provide \nthese\
      \ services in the client’s home on a more limited basis. \n2. Develop ACT programs,\
      \ ICM programs, or both selectively to address the needs of clients with SMI\
      \ \nwho have difficulty adhering to treatment regimens most effectively. ACT,\
      \ which is a more \ncomplex and expensive treatment model to implement compared\
      \ with ICM, has been used for \nclients with SMI who have difficulty adhering\
      \ to a treatment regimen. Typically, these are among the \nhighest users of\
      \ expensive (e.g., ED, hospital) services. ICM programs can be used with treatment-\n\
      resistant clients who are clinically and functionally capable of progressing\
      \ with much less intensive \nonsite counseling and less extensive monitoring.\
      \ \n3. Extend and modify ACT and ICM for other clients with CODs in SUD treatment.\
      \ With their strong \ntradition in the mental health field, particularly for\
      \ clients with SMI, ACT and ICM are attractive, \naccessible, and flexible treatment\
      \ approaches that can be adapted for individuals with CODs. \nComponents of\
      \ these programs can be integrated into SUD treatment programs. \n4. Add SUD\
      \ treatment components to existing ACT and ICM programs. Incorporating methods\
      \ from \nthe SUD treatment field, such as substance use education, peer mutual\
      \ support, and greater \npersonal responsibility, can continue to strengthen\
      \ the ACT approach as applied to clients with \nCODs. The degree of integration\
      \ of substance use and mental health components within ACT and \nICM is dependent\
      \ upon the ability of the individual case manager/counselor or the team to provide\
      \ \nboth services directly or with coordination. \n5. Extend the empirical base\
      \ of ACT and ICM to further establish their effectiveness for clients with \n\
      CODs in SUD treatment settings. The empirical base for ACT derives largely from\
      \ application among \npeople with SMI and needs to be extended to establish\
      \ firm support for the use of ACT across the \nentire COD population. In particular,\
      \ adding an evaluation component to new ACT programs in SUD \ntreatment can\
      \ provide documentation currently lacking in the field concerning the effectiveness\
      \ and \ncost benefit of ACT in treating the person who misuses substances with\
      \ co-occurring mental \ndisorders in SUD treatment settings. The limitations\
      \ of ICM have been listed in previous sections. \nProviders should use ACT or\
      \ ICM to meet clients’ needs as indicated by assessment. \nVocational Services\
      \ and Treatment Models \nVocational rehabilitation has long been one of the\
      \ services offered to clients recovering from mental disorders \nand, to some\
      \ degree, to those recovering from SUDs. The fact is that many individuals with\
      \ CODs are not \nworking, including 9 percent who are unemployed and 23 percent\
      \ not in the labor force for other reasons (e.g., \ndisabled, retired, in school)\
      \ (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2019). However, it is"

      unreasonable to expect employers to tolerate employees who are actively using\
      \ alcohol on the job or who \nviolate their drug-free workplace policies.  \n\
      Vocational support is vital because steady and unsteady work among people with\
      \ CODs has been linked to \nimprovement in symptoms, achieving independent housing,\
      \ and enhanced quality of life (McHugo, Drake, Xie, & \nBond, 2012). Vocational\
      \ programs and supported employment can help clients with CODs gain competitive\
      \ \nemployment, more work hours, and increased earned wages (Frounfelker, Wilkniss,\
      \ Bond, Devitt, & Drake, \n2011; Luciano & Carpenter-Song, 2014; Marshall et\
      \ al., 2014; Mueser, Campbell, & Drake, 2011). Therefore, if \nwork is to become\
      \ an achievable goal for individuals with CODs, vocational rehabilitation and\
      \ supported \nemployment should be integrated into comprehensive COD recovery\
      \ services.  \nVocational services can be incorporated into many treatment models,\
      \ including ACT and ICM. For more \ninformation about incorporating vocational\
      \ rehabilitation into treatment, see TIP 38, Integrating Substance \nAbuse Treatment\
      \ and Vocational Services (SAMHSA, 2000). \nDual Recovery Mutual Support Programs\
      \ \nThe dual recovery mutual support movement is emerging from two cultures:\
      \ the 12-Step recovery \nmovement and, more recently, the culture of the mental\
      \ health consumer movement. This section \ndescribes both, as well as other,\
      \ consumer-driven psychoeducational efforts. \nIn the past decade, mutual support\
      \ approaches have emerged for people with CODs. Mutual support \nprograms apply\
      \ a broad spectrum of personal responsibility and peer support principles, usually\
      \ \nincluding 12-Step programs. These programs are gaining recognition as more\
      \ meetings are being held in \nboth agency and community settings throughout\
      \ the United States, Canada, and abroad. \nIn recent years, dual recovery mutual\
      \ support organizations have emerged as a source of support for \npeople in\
      \ recovery from CODs (Bogenschutz et al., 2014b; Monica, Nikkel, & Drake, 2010;\
      \ Zweben & \nAshbrook, 2012). Mental health advocacy organizations—including\
      \ the National Alliance for the \nMentally Ill and the National Mental Health\
      \ Association—offer resources to help locate dual recovery \nmutual support\
      \ organizations (see “Resource Alert: Locating Mutual Support Groups for People\
      \ With \nCODs” and Appendix B). At the federal level, SAMHSA also has produced\
      \ documents identifying dual \nrecovery mutual support organizations (Center\
      \ for Mental Health Services, 1998; CSAT, 1994).  \nSeveral areas inform the\
      \ rationale for establishing dual recovery programs as additions to mutual \n\
      support programs (Bogenschutz et al., 2014b; Timko, Sutkowi, & Moos, 2010; Zweben\
      \ & Ashbrook, \n2012): \n• \nStigma and prejudice: Stigma related to both SUDs\
      \ and mental illness continues to be problematic, \ndespite the efforts of many\
      \ advocacy organizations. Unfortunately, these negative attitudes may \nsurface\
      \ within a meeting. When this occurs, people in dual recovery may find it difficult\
      \ to maintain \na level of trust and safety in the group setting. \n• \nInappropriate\
      \ or controversial advice (confused bias): Many members of addiction recovery\
      \ groups \nrecognize the real problem of cross-addiction and are aware that\
      \ people do use certain prescription \nmedications as intoxicating drugs. Confusion\
      \ about the appropriate role of psychiatric medication \nexists, and as a result,\
      \ some members may offer well-intended, but inappropriate, advice by \ncautioning\
      \ newcomers against using medications. Clearly, confused bias against medications\
      \ may \ncreate either of two problems. First, newcomers may follow inappropriate\
      \ advice and stop taking \ntheir medications, causing a recurrence of symptoms.\
      \ Second, newcomers quickly may recognize \nconfused bias against medications\
      \ within a meeting, feel uncomfortable, and keep a significant \naspect of their\
      \ recovery a secret."

      • \nInterpersonal connectedness: Individuals with CODs often experience difficulty\
      \ establishing and \nmaintaining close personal relationships. The presence\
      \ of a mental disorder could make establishing \nrapport and developing an alliance\
      \ with mutual support program members and sponsors more \ndifficult, subsequently\
      \ hindering participation and causing clients to feel reluctant about sharing\
      \ \ntheir stories and struggles with others who are only facing addiction rather\
      \ than both illnesses. \n• \nDirection for recovery: A strength of traditional\
      \ mutual support program fellowships is their ability \nto offer direction for\
      \ recovery that is based on years of collective experience. The new dual recovery\
      \ \nprograms offer an opportunity to begin drawing on the experiences that members\
      \ have \nencountered during both the progression of their CODs and the process\
      \ of their dual recovery. In \nturn, that body of experience can be shared with\
      \ fellow members and newcomers to provide \ndirection into the pathways to dual\
      \ recovery. \n• \nAcceptance: Mutual support program fellowships provide meetings\
      \ that offer settings for recovery. \nDual recovery meetings may offer members\
      \ and newcomers a setting of emotional acceptance, \nsupport, and empowerment.\
      \ This condition provides opportunities to develop a level of group trust \n\
      in which people can feel safe and able to share their ideas and feelings honestly\
      \ while focusing on \nrecovery from both illnesses.  \nAlthough a dual-focused\
      \ mutual support program is clearly preferable, people with CODs can still derive\
      \ \nbenefit from attending traditional mutual support groups, such as Alcoholics\
      \ Anonymous (AA). A meta-\nanalysis of 22 studies examining AA attendance by\
      \ people with CODs (Tonigan, Pearson, Magill, & \nHagler, 2018) found a significant\
      \ effect of increased alcohol abstinence compared to people with CODs \nwho\
      \ did not attend AA. Attending and being involved in AA and other non-COD-based\
      \ mutual support \ngroups appears to help young adults with CODs improve abstinence,\
      \ although rates of abstinence may \nnot improve as significantly as in young\
      \ adults with SUDs alone (Bergman, Greene, Hoeppner, \nSlaymaker, & Kelly, 2014).\
      \ \nDual Recovery Mutual Support Approaches \nDual recovery mutual support program\
      \ fellowship groups recognize the unique value of people in \nrecovery sharing\
      \ their personal experiences, strengths, and hope to help other people in recovery.\
      \ This \nsection provides an overview of emerging mutual-support fellowships\
      \ and describes a model mutual-\nsupport psychoeducational group. \nMutual-Support\
      \ Groups \nFour dual recovery mutual-support organizations have gained recognition\
      \ in the field. Each fellowship is \nan independent and autonomous membership\
      \ organization with its own principles, steps and traditions. \nDual recovery\
      \ fellowship members are free to interpret, use, or follow the program in a\
      \ way that meets \ntheir own needs. Members use the program to learn how to\
      \ manage their addiction and mental \ndisorders together. The following section\
      \ provides additional information on the supported mutual \nsupport model. (See\
      \ also “Resource Alert: Locating Mutual Support Groups for People with CODs.”)\
      \ \n1. Double Trouble in Recovery (DTR). This organization provides 12 Steps\
      \ that are based on a \ntraditional adaptation of the original 12 Steps. For\
      \ example, the identified problem in step one is \nchanged to CODs, and the\
      \ population to be assisted is changed in Step 12 accordingly. The \norganization\
      \ provides a format for meetings that are chaired by members of the fellowship.\
      \ \n2. Dual Disorders Anonymous. This organization follows a similar format\
      \ to DTR. It provides a meeting \nformat that is used by group members who chair\
      \ the meetings. \n3. Dual Recovery Anonymous. This organization provides 12\
      \ Steps adapted and expanded from the \ntraditional 12 Steps, similar to DTR\
      \ and Dual Disorders Anonymous. The terms “assets” and"

      “liabilities” are used instead of the traditional term “character defects.”\
      \ In addition, it incorporates \naffirmations into three of the 12 Steps. Similar\
      \ to other dual recovery fellowships, this organization \nprovides a suggested\
      \ meeting format that is used by group members who chair the meetings. \n4.\
      \ Dual Diagnosis Anonymous. This organization provides a hybrid approach that\
      \ uses 5 additional \nsteps in conjunction with the traditional 12 Steps. The\
      \ five steps differ from those of other dual \nrecovery groups in underscoring\
      \ the potential need for medical management, clinical interventions, \nand therapies.\
      \ Similar to other dual recovery fellowships, this organization provides a meeting\
      \ \nformat that is used by group members who chair the meetings. \nThe dual\
      \ recovery fellowships are membership organizations rather than consumer service\
      \ delivery \nprograms. The fellowships function as autonomous networks, providing\
      \ a system of support parallel to \ntraditional clinical or psychosocial services.\
      \ Meetings are facilitated by members, who are responsible, \nand take turns\
      \ “chairing” or “leading” the meetings for fellow members and newcomers. Meetings\
      \ are \nnot led by professional counselors (unless a member is a professional\
      \ counselor and takes a turn at \nleading a meeting), nor are members paid to\
      \ lead meetings. However, the fellowships may develop \ninformal working relationships\
      \ or linkages with professional providers and consumer organizations. \nDual\
      \ recovery mutual support program fellowships do not provide specific clinical\
      \ or counseling \ninterventions, classes on psychiatric symptoms, or any services\
      \ similar to case management. Dual \nrecovery fellowships maintain a primary\
      \ purpose of members helping one another achieve and maintain \ndual recovery,\
      \ prevent relapse, and carry the message of recovery to others who experience\
      \ dual \ndisorders. Dual recovery mutual support program members who take turns\
      \ chairing their meetings are \nmembers of their fellowship as a whole. Anonymity\
      \ of meeting attendees is preserved because group \nfacilitators do not record\
      \ the names of their fellow members or newcomers. Fellowship members carry \n\
      out the primary purpose through the service work of their groups and meetings.\
      \ \nGroups provide various types of meetings, such as step study meetings, in\
      \ which the discussion revolves \naround ways to use the fellowship’s 12 Steps\
      \ for personal recovery. Another type of meeting is a topic \ndiscussion meeting,\
      \ in which members present topics related to dual recovery and discuss how they\
      \ \ncope with situations by applying the recovery principles and steps of their\
      \ fellowship. Hospital and \ninstitutional meetings may be provided by fellowship\
      \ members to individuals currently in hospitals, \ntreatment programs, or criminal\
      \ justice settings. \nFellowship members who are experienced in recovery may\
      \ sponsor newer members. Newcomers may \nask a member they view as experienced\
      \ to help them learn fellowship recovery principles and steps. \nOutreach by\
      \ fellowship members may provide information about their organization to agencies\

      Access and Linkage \nThe fellowships are independent organizations based on\
      \ 12-Step principles and traditions that generally \ndevelop cooperative and\
      \ informal relationships with service providers and other organizations. The\
      \ \nfellowships can be seen as providing a source of support that is parallel\
      \ to formal services, that is, \nparticipation while receiving treatment and\
      \ continuing care services. \nReferral to dual recovery fellowships is informal:\
      \ \n• \nAn agency may provide a “host setting” for one of the fellowships to\
      \ hold its meetings. The agency \nmay arrange for its clients to attend the\
      \ scheduled meeting. \n• \nAn agency may provide transportation for its clients\
      \ to attend a community meeting provided by \none of the fellowships. \n• \n\
      An agency may offer a schedule of community meetings provided by one of the\
      \ fellowships as a \nsupport to referral for clients. \nCommon Features of Dual\
      \ Recovery Mutual-Support Fellowships \nDual recovery fellowships tend to have\
      \ the following in common: \n• \nA perspective describing CODs and dual recovery\
      \ \n• \nA series of steps providing a plan to achieve and maintain dual recovery\
      \ \n• \nLiterature describing the program for members and the public \n• \n\
      A structure for conducting meetings in a way that provides a setting of acceptance\
      \ and support \n• \nPlans for establishing an organizational structure to guide\
      \ growth of membership, that is, a central \noffice, fellowship network of area\
      \ intergroups, groups, and meetings. An “intergroup” is an assembly \nof people\
      \ made up of delegates from several groups in an area. It functions as a communications\
      \ \nlink upward to the central office or offices and outward to all the area\
      \ groups it serves. \nEmpirical Evidence \nEmpirical evidence suggests that\
      \ participation in mutual support programs contributes substantially to \nmembers’\
      \ progress in dual recovery and should be encouraged. Specifically, studies\
      \ have found the \nfollowing positive outcomes: \n• \nAmong veterans with an\
      \ SUD and depression, lower scores of depression and lower future alcohol \n\
      use (Worley, Tate, & Brown, 2012) \n• \nFewer days of alcohol and other substance\
      \ use, better scores of mental health, and fewer self-\nreported substance-related\
      \ problems (Rosenblum et al., 2014; Woodhead, Cowden Hindash & \nTimko, 2013)\
      \ \n• \nGreater treatment attendance and possibly increased alcohol abstinence\
      \ and decreased drinks per \ndrinking day over time (but not necessarily better\
      \ than usual care) (Bogenschutz et al., 2014b) \nQualitative studies (Hagler\
      \ et al., 2015; Matusow et al., 2013; Penn, Brooke, Brooks, Gallagher, & \n\
      Barnard, 2016; Roush, Monica, Carpenter-Song, & Drake, 2015) exploring perspectives\
      \ of clients with \nCODs who engage in mutual support services (e.g., 12-Step\
      \ and SMART Recovery) also detail numerous \nperceived benefits from these programs,\
      \ such as: \n• \nFellowship building (e.g., meeting others with similar problems).\
      \ \nDual recovery mutual-support programs recognize the unique value of people\
      \ in recovery sharing their personal \nexperiences, strengths, and hope to help\
      \ other people in recovery.\n\n[Page 236]\nTIP 42, Substance Use Disorder Treatment\

      • \nAddressing spiritual needs/topics (this may be considered a negative aspect\
      \ by some clients). \n• \nBuilding comradery, affiliation, and a sense of community.\
      \ \n• \nHaving a “safe space” to share experiences without fear of judgment\
      \ or rejection. \n• \nIncreased knowledge/insight about mental illness and SUDs\
      \ (especially how they interrelate). \n• \nLearning skills and tools that facilitate\
      \ recovery. \n• \nFeeling empowered. \n• \nDeveloping a sense of hope for recovery.\
      \ \n• \nAccess to therapy/therapeutic services that would otherwise be inaccessible,\
      \ given lack of insurance. \nPeer Recovery Support Services \nThe inclusion\
      \ of peer supports—people who have experienced addiction, mental illness, or\
      \ both and are \nin recovery—in SUD and mental illness recovery processes has\
      \ increased substantially in the past \ndecade. Peer recovery support services\
      \ can help improve long-term recovery by increasing abstinence, \ndecreasing\
      \ inpatient services and hospitalization, and improving functioning (Bassuk,\
      \ Hanson, Greene, \nRichard, & Laudet, 2016; Chinman et al., 2014; Davidson,\
      \ Bellamy, Guy, & Miller, 2012; Reif, Braude, et \nal., 2014).  \nResearch suggests\
      \ that peer-based services help people with mental disorders and SUDs improve\
      \ clinical \nand functional outcomes (Acri, Hooley, Richardson, & Moaba, 2017;\
      \ Bassuk et al., 2016; Chapman, \nBlash, Mayer, & Spetz, 2018; Chinman et al.,\
      \ 2014; Reif, Braude, et al., 2014; SAMHSA, 2017). These \ninclude: \n• \nRates\
      \ of abstinence. \n• \nNumber of days abstinent. \n• \nRelapse rates. \n• \n\
      Treatment engagement. \n• \nTreatment retention. \n• \nResidential treatment\
      \ use. \n• \nRehospitalization. \n• \nAdherence to treatment plan. \n• \nTreatment\
      \ completion. \n• \nTreatment satisfaction. \n• \nRelationships with treatment\
      \ providers. \n• \nHousing stability. \n• \nProbation/parole status. \n• \n\
      Number of criminal justice charges. \n• \nRecovery capital. \n• \nMental disorder\
      \ symptoms. \n• \nKnowledge about mental illness and SUDs. \n• \nFamily functioning,\
      \ including parenting abilities. \n• \nAccess to social supports. \nLittle research\
      \ has examined the use of peer supports for CODs. Given the success of peer\
      \ services in \npromoting recovery and wellness in people with either mental\
      \ illness or addiction, it is reasonable to \nhypothesize that peer support\
      \ could also be effective for individuals with both. O’Connell, Flanagan,"

      Delphin-Rittmon, & Davidson (2017) found inclusion of peer supports for people\
      \ with co-occurring \npsychosis and substance misuse significantly improved\
      \ positive (but not negative) symptoms of \npsychosis, number of days of alcohol\
      \ use, number of days experiencing alcohol-related problems, self-\nrated importance\
      \ of getting treatment for alcohol misuse, feelings of relatedness, social functioning,\
      \ and \ninpatient readmissions relative to a treatment as usual condition. Evidence-based\
      \ interventions for \nCODs, such as ACT and integrated therapies, were not originally\
      \ designed to include peer support, but \nmore and more, peer providers are\
      \ becoming a formal part of COD treatment teams (Harrison, \nCousins, Spybrook,\
      \ & Curtis, 2017). Including peers in COD services might improve staff treatment\
      \ \nfidelity, which is critical for ensuring evidence-based services produce\
      \ intended outcomes (Harrison et \nal., 2017). \nTreatment Settings \nTCs \n\
      The goals of TCs are to promote abstinence from alcohol and illicit drug use,\
      \ and to effect a global \nchange in lifestyle, including attitudes and values.\
      \ The TC views substance misuse as a disorder of the \nwhole person, reflecting\
      \ problems in conduct, attitudes, moods, values, and emotional management. \n\
      Treatment focuses on substance abstinence, coupled with social and psychological\
      \ change that requires \na multidimensional effort, involving intensive mutual\
      \ support, typically in a residential setting. \nResidential TC treatment duration\
      \ is typically 6 to 12 months, although treatment duration has been \ndecreasing\
      \ under the influence of managed care and other factors.  \nIn a definitive\
      \ book titled The Therapeutic Community: Theory, Model, and Method, De Leon\
      \ (2000) \nprovided a full description of the TC for SUD treatment to advance\
      \ research and guide training, practice, \nand program development. Descriptions\
      \ of TCs also appear in the National Institute on Drug Abuse \n(NIDA, 2015)\
      \ Research Report titled Therapeutic Communities \n(https://d14rmgtrwzf5a.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/therapueticcomm_rrs_0723.pdf).\
      \  \nTCs have demonstrated positive outcomes in substance misuse and SUD treatment\
      \ retention (De Leon, \n2015; NIDA, 2015). A review of randomized and nonrandomized\
      \ trials of TCs (Vanderplasschen et al., \n2013) found that, compared with control\
      \ conditions, TCs gave advantages in employment, psychological \nsymptoms, and\
      \ family/social relationships. SUD outcomes were variable but generally favored\
      \ the TC \ncondition. Relapse rates among TC clients also varied widely but\
      \ were relatively high (25 percent to 55 \npercent returned to substance use\
      \ within 12 to 18 months), although time to relapse was typically \nlonger in\
      \ TCs than in control conditions. This is consistent with earlier research from\
      \ Malivert, Fatséas, \nDenis, Langlois, & Auriacombe (2012) that associated\
      \ TCs with decreased substance use but high relapse \nrates. Clients in TCs\
      \ with lower relapse rates tended to stay longer in treatment and continuing\
      \ care \nthan people who relapsed more quickly. Forensic outcomes were consistently\
      \ positive for recidivism, \nrearrests, and reincarceration, even over time\
      \ (3 years and 5 years). Again, TCs plus continuing care \nwere associated with\
      \ even greater improvements in abstinence and rearrests than TCs only.  \nWhat\
      \ Makes TCs Work? \nIt remains unclear how and why TCs are effective at improving\
      \ outcomes for people recovering from addiction. \nPearce and Pickard (2013)\
      \ suggest that TCs are effective because of their ability to promote in clients\
      \ a sense of \nbelongingness, which is associated with better self-esteem and\
      \ feelings of acceptance and happiness. TCs \npromote belongingness through\
      \ high frequency of client contacts that are positive in nature, that exhibit\
      \ mutual \nconcern for the client’s wellbeing, and that occur over a long period\
      \ of time."

      The other key mechanism is the ability of TCs to promote in clients a sense\
      \ of responsible agency. This includes \nthe ability to: (1) “reflect on one’s\
      \ behavior, make decisions about how one wants to do things differently, form\
      \ \nresolutions, and commit to change” as well as (2) “to see this resolution\
      \ or commitment through: not to waver \nfrom the chosen course, or, if one wavers,\
      \ to find a way to get back on track rather than sink into despair” \n(Pearce\
      \ & Pickard, 2013, p. 7). Responsible agency has been linked to greater self-efficacy\
      \ and ability to change \nbehaviors (and sustain those new behaviors over time).\
      \ TCs promote responsible agency through motivational \ninterviewing; cognitive\
      \ interventions like CBT or dialectical behavior therapy; and by helping clients\
      \ understand \nthe relationships between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\
      \ \nModified TCs for Clients With CODs \nThe modified TC (MTC) approach adapts\
      \ the principles and methods of the TC to the circumstances of \nthe client\
      \ with CODs. The illustrative work in this area has been done with people with\
      \ CODs, both men \nand women, providing treatment based on community-as-method—that\
      \ is, the community is the \nhealing agent. This section focuses on MTCs as\
      \ a potent residential model for SUD treatment; most of \nthis section applies\
      \ to both TC and other residential SUD treatment programs.  \nTreatment Activities/Interventions\
      \  \nAll program activities and interactions, singly and in combination, are\
      \ designed to produce change. \nInterventions are grouped into four categories—community\
      \ enhancement (to promote affiliation with \nthe TC community), therapeutic/educative\
      \ (to promote expression and instruction), community/clinical \nmanagement (to\
      \ maintain personal and physical safety), and vocational (to operate the facility\
      \ and \nprepare clients for employment). Implementation of the groups and activities\
      \ listed in Exhibit 7.2 \nestablishes the TC community. Although each intervention\
      \ has specific individual functions, all share \ncommunity, therapeutic, and\
      \ educational purposes. \nExhibit 7.2. TC Activities and Components \n• Maintaining\
      \ highly structured daily regimens that include: \n− Morning and evening house\
      \ meetings \n− Daily jobs/tasks \n− Individual therapy sessions \n− Group therapy\
      \ sessions \n− Seminars and education meetings \n• Adhering to clearly articulated\
      \ expectations (accompanied by rewards and punishments to help shape \nadaptive\
      \ behaviors) \n• Vocation or educational activities, or both \n• Social activities\
      \ to increase bonding among housemates and help client establish healthy, supportive\
      \ \nnetworks, such as: \n− Group discussions, including group therapy, to help\
      \ change behaviors and cognitions and build new skills \n− Community meetings\
      \ to review the rules, goals, and procedures of the TC \n− Education meetings\
      \ (e.g., seminars) \n− Role-playing activities \n− Games and recreational activities\
      \ \nSource: NIDA (2015). \nKey Modifications \nThe MTC alters the traditional\
      \ TC approach in response to the client’s psychiatric and addiction-related\
      \ \nsymptoms, cognitive impairments, reduced level of functioning, short attention\
      \ span, and poor urge"

      control. A noteworthy alteration is the change from encounter group to conflict\
      \ resolution group. \nConflict resolution groups have the following features:\
      \ \n• \nStaff led and guided throughout \n• \nThree highly structured and often\
      \ formalized phases: \n− Feedback on behavior from one participant to another\
      \ \n− Opportunity for both participants to explain their position \n− Resolution\
      \ between participants with plans for behavior change \n• \nSubstantially reduced\
      \ emotional intensity; emphasis on instruction and learning of new behaviors\
      \ \n• \nPersuasive appeal for personal honesty, truthfulness in dealing with\
      \ others, and responsible \nbehavior to self and others \nTo create an MTC program\
      \ for clients with CODs, three fundamental alterations can be applied: \n1.\
      \ Increased flexibility \n2. Decreased intensity \n3. Greater individualization\
      \ \nMore recent adaptations also can include: \n• \nAccepting clients on medication-assisted\
      \ treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and, in some \ncases, incorporating\
      \ medication into treatment plans (NIDA, 2015). \n• \nPlacing greater limits\
      \ on long-term residential treatment, given rising healthcare costs (NIDA, 2015).\
      \ \n• \nTeaming with a medical facility that provides integrated healthcare\
      \ services so that the TC can be \nconsidered a federally qualified health center\
      \ and thus help increase treatment access for \nvulnerable populations, including\
      \ people with CODs (NIDA, 2015; Smith, 2012). \nNevertheless, the central TC\
      \ feature remains; the MTC, like all TC programs, seeks to develop a culture\
      \ \nin which clients learn through mutual support and affiliation with the community\
      \ to foster change in \nthemselves and others. Respect for ethnic, racial, and\
      \ gender differences is a basic tenet of all TC \nprograms and is part of teaching\
      \ the general lesson of respect for self and others. Exhibit 7.3 \nsummarizes\
      \ the key modifications necessary to address the unique needs of clients with\
      \ CODs. \nExhibit 7.3. TC Modifications for People With CODs \nStructural modifications\
      \  \nProcess modifications \nIntervention modifications \nThere is increased\
      \ flexibility in program \nactivities.  \nSanctions are fewer \nwith greater\
      \ \nopportunity for \ncorrective learning \nexperiences.  \nOrientation and\
      \ instruction are \nemphasized in programming/planning.  \nMeetings and activities\
      \ are shorter.  \nIndividual counseling is provided more \nfrequently to enable\
      \ clients to absorb \nthe TC experience.  \nThere is greatly reduced intensity\
      \ of \ninterpersonal interaction.  \nEngagement and \nstabilization receive\
      \ \nmore time and effort.  \nTask assignments are individualized.  \nMore explicit\
      \ affirmation is given for \nachievements.  \nBreaks are offered frequently\
      \ during \nwork tasks.  \nGreater sensitivity is shown to individual \ndifferences.\
      \  \nProgression through \nthe program is paced \nindividually, according \n\
      to the client’s rate of \nlearning.  \nIndividual counseling and instruction\
      \ are \nmore immediately provided in work-\nrelated activities.  \nGreater responsiveness\
      \ to the special \ndevelopmental needs of the individual.  \nEngagement is emphasized\
      \ throughout \ntreatment.  \nMore staff guidance is given in the \nimplementation\
      \ of activities; many \nCriteria for moving to \nthe next phase are \nActivities\
      \ are designed to overlap."

      \ Sacks & Sacks (2011). \n \nAdvice to Administrators: Recommended Treatment\
      \ and Services From the MTC \nModel \nIn addition to the general guidelines\
      \ for working with people who have CODs described in Chapter 5, the \nfollowing\
      \ treatment recommendations are derived from MTC work and are applicable across\
      \ all models:  \n• Treat the whole person.  \n• Provide a highly structured\
      \ daily regimen.  \n• Use peers to help one another.  \n• Rely on a network\
      \ or community for both support and healing.  \n• Regard all interactions as\
      \ opportunities for change.  \n• Foster positive growth and development.  \n\
      • Promote change in behavior, attitudes, values, and lifestyle.  \n• Teach,\
      \ honor, and respect cultural values, beliefs, and differences.  \nRole of the\
      \ Family \nMany MTC clients come from highly impaired, disrupted family situations.\
      \ MTC programs offer them a \nnew reference and support group. Some clients\
      \ do have available intact families or family members who \nare supportive.\
      \ For these clients, MTC programs offer various family-centered activities like\
      \ special \nfamily weekend visiting, family education and counseling sessions,\
      \ and, if children are involved, classes \nfocused on prevention. All such activities\
      \ occur later in treatment to facilitate client reintegration into \nthe family\
      \ and into mainstream living. \nEmpirical Evidence \nA series of studies has\
      \ established that: \n• \nMTCs affect a wide range of clinical and functional\
      \ variables, including substance use, mental \ndisorder symptoms, criminal behavior,\
      \ employment, and housing (Sacks, McKendrick, Sacks, & \nCleland, 2010). For\
      \ instance, a review of TCs and MTCs (Magor-Blatch, Bhullar, Thomson, & \nThorsteinsson,\
      \ 2014) reported reduced substance use (including increased abstinence and reduced\
      \ \nrisk of relapse), decreased criminal behavior (including rearrests and reincarcerations),\
      \ and \nimproved psychological functioning among diverse populations, including\
      \ people with CODs. \nHowever, benefits were more consistent from pre–post treatment\
      \ than when comparing TCs/MTCs \nwith control groups (e.g., no treatment, other\
      \ treatment)."

      • \nAmong people involved in the criminal justice system who have CODs, MTCs\
      \ can effectively reduce \nSUD and mental illness symptoms, delay relapse, improve\
      \ social functioning, reduce criminal \nactivity, and decrease recidivism compared\
      \ with traditional TCs (Magor-Blatch et al., 2014; Peters et \nal., 2017). MTCs\
      \ also appear to reduce reincarceration better than parole supervision (Sacks,\
      \ Chaple, \nSacks, McKendrick, & Cleland, 2012). \n• \nPeople with CODs and\
      \ HIV receiving MTC continuing care had a greater decrease in SUD and mental\
      \ \nillness symptoms at 6 months than people receiving standard continuing care\
      \ (Sacks, McKendrick, \nVazan, Sacks, & Cleland, 2011). Larger improvements\
      \ were observed in MTC clients who had higher \nlevels of psychosocial functioning\
      \ and health at the start of treatment. \n• \nMTCs can meet the various needs\
      \ of pregnant and parenting women with SUDs—many of whom \nhave co-occurring\
      \ mental disorders, experiences with homelessness, criminal justice involvement,\
      \ or \na combination thereof. One such program (Bromberg, Backman, Krow, & Frankel,\
      \ 2010) reduced \nrecidivism, promoted long-term abstinence (about 90 percent\
      \ of clients remained abstinent for 2 \nyears after program completion), and\
      \ facilitated drug-free births and healthy infant development.  \nOutpatient\
      \ SUD Treatment  \nTreatment for SUDs occurs most frequently in outpatient settings—a\
      \ term that encompasses a variety \nof disparate programs (Cohen, Freeborn,\
      \ & McManus, 2013; NIDA, 2018b; SAMHSA, 2019b). Some offer \nhigh-intensity\
      \ services, like several hours of treatment each week, which can include mental\
      \ health and \nother support services as well as individual and group counseling\
      \ for substance misuse; others provide \nminimal services, such as only one\
      \ or two brief sessions to give clients information and refer them \nelsewhere\
      \ (NIDA, 2018b). Some agencies offer outpatient programs that provide services\
      \ several hours \nper day and several days per week, thus meeting the LOCUS\
      \ criteria for High Intensity Community Based \nServices. \nResource Alert:\
      \ How to Implement TC/MTC Programming \nGuidance on designing and implementing\
      \ TCs/MTCs is available online through various manuals, reports, and \nother\
      \ documentation. Some of the publications in the following list are specific\
      \ to a particular organization or \nstate. However, they can still serve as\

      Typically, treatment includes individual and group counseling, with referrals\
      \ to appropriate community \nservices. Until recently, there were few specialized\
      \ approaches for people with CODs in outpatient SUD \ntreatment settings.  \n\
      Many of individuals with CODs have multiple health and social problems that\
      \ complicate their \ntreatment. Evidence from prior studies indicates that a\
      \ mental disorder often makes effective SUD \ntreatment harder because of cognitive,\
      \ psychosocial, and economic barriers that hinder engagement \nand retention\
      \ (Priester et al., 2016). Outpatient treatment programs are available widely\
      \ and serve the \nmost clients (Cohen et al., 2013; SAMHSA, 2019b), so using\
      \ current best practices from the SUD \ntreatment and mental health fields is\
      \ vital. Doing so enables these programs to use the best available \ntreatment\
      \ models to reach the greatest possible number of people with CODs. \nPrevalence\
      \ \nOutpatient SUD treatment programs are the most common form of SUD treatment\
      \ setting in this \ncountry. In 2018, 83 percent of SUD treatment facilities\
      \ in the United States offered outpatient services \n(SAMHSA, 2019b). Specifically,\
      \ 77 percent offered regular outpatient services, 46 percent intensive \noutpatient,\
      \ 14 percent day treatment or partial hospitalization, 10 percent outpatient\
      \ detoxification, \nand 28 percent outpatient methadone/buprenorphine maintenance\
      \ or naltrexone treatment. \nCODs are commonly found in clients who enter SUD\
      \ treatment. In 2018, 50.2 percent of individuals in \nSUD treatment had a COD,\
      \ and 99.8 percent of SUD treatment facilities reported having clients with\
      \ \nCODs (SAMHSA, 2019b). Despite the complexity of CODs, outpatient programs\
      \ have good capacity (e.g., \norganization structures and policies) to meet\
      \ the treatment needs of these populations, perhaps even \nmore so than intensive\
      \ outpatient programs and residential programs (Lambert-Harris, Saunders, \n\
      McGovern, & Xie, 2013).  \nEmpirical Evidence of Effectiveness \nOutpatient\
      \ settings can paired with a variety of treatment approaches to help clients\
      \ with CODs \nsuccessfully improve substance-related, mental health outcomes,\
      \ and functional outcomes, including \nfrequency of substance use, abstinence,\
      \ relapse risk, mental illness symptom remission, psychiatric \nhospitalizations,\
      \ social functioning, having independent housing, gaining competitive employment,\
      \ and \nlife satisfaction (Drake, Bond, et al., 2016; Haller, Norman, et al.,\
      \ 2016; McDonell et al., 2013). Most \nintegrated treatments—such as those combining\
      \ CBT, motivational interviewing, and family services—\nare offered in outpatient,\
      \ not residential, settings and have a strong evidence base supporting their\
      \ \neffectiveness for CODs (Kelly & Daley, 2013), including SMI with SUDs (Cleary,\
      \ Hunt, Matheson, & \nWalter, 2009; De Witte et al., 2014). \nOutpatient COD\
      \ treatment can yield positive outcomes even when treatment is not tailored\
      \ specifically \nto CODs. Tiet and Schutte (2012) reviewed the differential\
      \ benefits of COD treatment at either \naddiction, mental illness, or COD outpatient\
      \ treatment programs. All clients improved in 6-month \nabstinence and suicide\
      \ attempts compared to baseline, although people attending COD outpatient \n\
      settings did not fare any better on these outcomes than clients completing outpatient\
      \ treatment from \nSUD clinics or mental health service clinics.  \nOutpatient\
      \ treatment can also be leveraged as a form of continuing care, such as following\
      \ discharge \nfrom hospitalization or release from jail/prison, to help clients\
      \ maintain long-term recovery and wellness \n(Grella & Shi, 2011). Six-month\
      \ outpatient ACT treatment for men with SMI and SUD (Noel, Woods, \nRouthier,\

      housing, education, employment, family functioning, spirituality, and sleep\
      \ hygiene. Outpatient mental \nhealth services focused on supporting community\
      \ reintegration following release from jail were \nassociated with 12-month\
      \ declines in number of arrests and number of days in jail among people with\
      \ \nCODs and people with mental disorders only (Alarid & Rubin, 2018). \nEvidence\
      \ suggests that intensive outpatient treatment for people with CODs can improve\
      \ substance \nmisuse and increase abstinence among a range of populations, including\
      \ civilians and veterans, women, \npeople from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds,\
      \ uninsured individuals, and people experiencing \nhomelessness (McCarty et\
      \ al., 2014). Intensive outpatient treatment has been associated with decreases\
      \ \nin psychological symptoms and distress, decreases in the average number\
      \ of days per week of substance \nuse, improvements in Global Assessment of\
      \ Functioning scores, and high client satisfaction (Wise, 2010). \nDesigning\
      \ Outpatient Programs for Clients With CODs \nPeople with CODs vary in their\
      \ motivation for treatment, nature and severity of their SUD (e.g., drug of\
      \ \nchoice, polysubstance misuse), and nature and severity of their mental disorder.\
      \ However, most clients \nwith CODs in outpatient treatment have less serious\
      \ and more stabilized mental and SUD symptoms \nthan those in residential treatment\
      \ (Mee-Lee et al., 2013). \nOutpatient treatment can be the primary treatment\
      \ or provide continuing care for clients after \nresidential treatment, offering\
      \ flexibility in activities/interventions and intensity of treatment. \nTreatment\
      \ failures occur for people with SMI and those with less serious mental disorders\
      \ for several \nreasons, among the most important being that programs lack resources\
      \ to provide time for mental \nhealth services and medications that would likely\
      \ improve recovery rates and recovery time significantly. \nIf lack of funding\
      \ prevents the full integration of mental health assessment and medication services\
      \ \nwithin an SUD treatment agency that provides outpatient services, establishing\
      \ a collaborative \nrelationship with a mental health agency (through the mechanism\
      \ of a memorandum of agreement) \nwould ensure that the services for the clients\
      \ with CODs are adequate and comprehensive. In addition, \nmodifications are\
      \ needed both to the design of treatment interventions and to the training of\
      \ staff to \nensure implementation of interventions appropriate to the needs\
      \ of the client with CODs. \nTo meet the needs of specific populations among\
      \ people with CODs, the consensus panel encourages \noutpatient treatment programs\
      \ to develop special services for populations that are represented in \nsignificant\
      \ numbers in their programs. Examples include women, women with dependent children,\
      \ \nindividuals and families experiencing homelessness, and racial/ethnic populations.\
      \ (Information on how \nprograms can adapt services to these and other vulnerable\
      \ populations can be found in Chapter 6.) \nTypes of CODs will vary depending\
      \ on the subpopulation targeted; each program must deal with CODs in \na different\
      \ manner, often by adding other treatment components for CODs to existing program\
      \ models. \nResource Alert: Outpatient SUD Treatment \n• SAMHSA’s TIP 47, Substance\

      monitoring, those who need detoxification, and those with serious SUDs who may\
      \ require a period of \nabstinence or reduced use before they can engage actively\
      \ in all treatment components. Information \nabout the full screening and assessment\
      \ process, which includes referral, is in Chapter 3. \nCounselors should view\
      \ clients’ placement in outpatient care in the context of continuity of care\
      \ and the \nnetwork of available providers and programs. Outpatient treatment\
      \ programs may serve a variety of \nfunctions, including outreach/engagement,\
      \ primary treatment, and continuing care. Ideally, a full range \nof outpatient\
      \ SUD treatment programs would include interventions for unmotivated, disaffiliated\
      \ clients \nwith CODs, as well as for those seeking abstinence-based primary\
      \ treatments and those requiring \ncontinuity of supports to sustain recovery.\
      \ \nLikewise, ideal outpatient programs will facilitate access to services through\
      \ rapid response to all agency \nand self-referral contacts, imposing few exclusionary\
      \ criteria, and using some client/treatment matching \ncriteria to ensure that\
      \ all referrals can be engaged in some level of treatment. Additional criteria\
      \ for \nadmission may be imposed on the treatment agency by the State, insurance\
      \ companies, or other \nfunding sources. Per the consensus panel, treatment\
      \ providers should not place clients in a higher level \nof care (i.e., more\
      \ intense) than necessary. A client who may remain engaged in a less intense\
      \ treatment \nenvironment may drop out in response to the demands of a more\
      \ intense treatment program. \nEngagement and Retention \nBecause clients with\
      \ CODs often have lower treatment engagement, every effort should be made to\
      \ use \ntreatment methods with the best prospects for increasing engagement.\
      \ Clients with CODs, especially \nthose opposed to traditional treatment approaches\
      \ and those who do not accept that they have CODs, \ncan have difficulty committing\
      \ to and maintaining treatment. By providing continuous outreach, \nengagement,\
      \ direct assistance with immediate life problems (e.g., housing), advocacy,\
      \ and close \nmonitoring of individual needs, the ACT and ICM models provide\
      \ techniques that enable clients to \naccess services and foster the development\
      \ of treatment relationships.  \nImproving Engagement and Adherence of Clients\
      \ With CODs in Outpatient Settings \n• Implement behavioral continuing care\
      \ contracts for clients transitioning from residential treatment into \noutpatient\
      \ care. \n• Use reminders (e.g., mailed appointment cards, telephone calls);\
      \ offer feedback before sessions to promote \nattendance. \n• Follow up by phone\
      \ with clients who miss appointments. \n• Reinforce attendance to appointments\
      \ with praise and other rewards (e.g., earning a certification of \ncompletion\
      \ after attending a certain number of sessions; earning a medal or other recognition\
      \ for \ncompleting all required sessions). \n• Offer peer recovery support services.\
      \ \n• Use incentives to increase clients’ buy-in about the need for and importance\
      \ of treatment. Incentives related \nto assistance with housing and employment\
      \ may be particularly meaningful and therefor effective. \n• Rather than solely\
      \ creating treatment goals focused centrally around abstinence, work with clients\
      \ to \ndevelop treatment goals focused on reducing the harmful effects of substance\
      \ use (e.g., reducing \nhomelessness by gaining independent housing). \n• People\
      \ with CODs who have positive family relationships are more likely to stay engaged\
      \ in treatment. Help \nclients lacking family support build up this area. With\
      \ permission from the client, include family in treatment \nand educate them\
      \ on the importance of being a source of emotional and tangible support for\
      \ the client. \n• Helping clients understand the connection between substance\
      \ and negative outcomes (e.g., legal problems, \nhousing and employment instability,\
      \ exacerbating mental disorder symptoms) can help them understand the"

      Discharge Planning \nDischarge planning is important to maintain gains achieved\
      \ through outpatient care. Clients with CODs \nleaving an outpatient SUD treatment\
      \ program have a number of continuing care options. These options \ninclude\
      \ mutual support programs, relapse prevention groups, continued individual counseling,\
      \ mental \nhealth services (especially important for clients who will continue\
      \ to require medication), as well as ICM \nmonitoring and supports. A carefully\
      \ developed discharge plan, produced in collaboration with the \nclient, will\
      \ identify and match client needs with community resources, providing supports\
      \ to sustain \nprogress achieved in outpatient treatment. The provider seeks\
      \ to develop a support network for the \nclient that involves family, community,\
      \ recovery groups, friends, and significant others. \nClients with CODs often\
      \ need a range of services besides SUD treatment and mental health services.\
      \ \nGenerally, prominent needs include housing and case management services\
      \ to establish access to \ncommunity health and social services. In fact, these\
      \ two services should not be considered “ancillary,” \nbut key ingredients for\
      \ clients’ successful recovery. Without a place to live and some degree of \n\
      economic stability, clients with CODs are likely to return to substance use\
      \ or experience a return of \nsymptoms of mental disorder. Every SUD treatment\
      \ provider should have the strongest possible \nlinkages with community resources\
      \ to help address these and other client needs. Clients with CODs \noften will\
      \ require a wide variety of services that cannot be provided by a single program.\
      \ \nIt is imperative that discharge planning for clients with CODs ensures continuity\
      \ of services, medication \nmanagement, and support, without which client stability\
      \ and recovery are severely compromised. \nRelapse prevention interventions\
      \ after outpatient treatment need to be modified so clients can \nrecognize\
      \ symptoms of SUD or mental disorder relapse on their own, use symptom management\
      \ \ntechniques (e.g., self-monitoring, reporting to a “buddy,” group monitoring),\
      \ and access assessment \nservices rapidly, as the return of psychiatric symptoms\
      \ can often trigger substance use relapse. \nDeveloping positive peer networks\
      \ is another important facet of discharge planning for continuing \ncare. The\
      \ provider seeks to develop a support network for the client that involves family,\
      \ community, \nrecovery groups, friends, and significant others. If a client’s\
      \ family of origin is not healthy and \nsupportive, other networks can be accessed\
      \ or developed for support. Programs also should encourage \nclient participation\
      \ in mutual support programs, particularly those that focus on CODs (e.g., dual\
      \ \nrecovery mutual support groups). These groups can provide a continuing supportive\
      \ network for the \nclient, who usually can continue to participate in such\
      \ programs even if he moves to a different \ncommunity. Therefore, these groups\
      \ are an important method of providing continuity of care. \nThe consensus panel\
      \ also recommends that programs working with clients who have CODs try to involve\
      \ \nadvocacy groups in program activities. These groups can help clients become\
      \ advocates themselves, \nfurthering the development and responsiveness of the\
      \ treatment program while enhancing clients’ \nsense of self-esteem and providing\
      \ a source of affiliation. \nResidential SUD Treatment  \nResidential treatment\
      \ for SUDs comes in a variety of forms, including long-term residential treatment\
      \ \nfacilities, criminal justice-based programs, halfway houses, and short-term\
      \ residential programs. The \nlong-term residential SUD treatment facility is\
      \ the primary treatment site and the focus of this section of \nneed for treatment.\
      \ This is vital as perceived need for treatment is a common barrier to entering\
      \ and staying \nengaged in SUD treatment. \nSources: Brown, Bennett, Li, & Bellack\

      the TIP. Historically, residential SUD treatment facilities have provided treatment\
      \ to clients with more \nserious and active SUDs but with less SMI. Most providers\
      \ now agree that the prevalence of people with \nSMI entering residential SUD\
      \ treatment facilities has risen. \nPrevalence \nIn 2018, 24 percent of SUD\
      \ treatment facilities in the United States offered any residential treatment\
      \ \n(SAMHSA, 2019b). Specifically, 14 percent offered short-term residential\
      \ care, 19 percent, long-term \ncare; and 8 percent, residential detoxification.\
      \ \nClients admitted to long-term residential care tend to have more severe\
      \ substance misuse and \npsychiatric problems. Veterans with SUDs and PTSD admitted\
      \ to residential treatment reported worse \nPTSD symptoms, more frequent substance\
      \ use, more time spent around high-risk people or places, and \nfewer days spent\
      \ at work or school than veterans with SUDs and PTSD who entered outpatient\
      \ care \n(Haller, Colvonen, et al., 2016). Other studies have found an increased\
      \ rate of suicide attempt and \nviolence (as a victim and as a perpetrator)\
      \ among people with CODs entering residential treatment \n(Havassy & Mericle,\
      \ 2013; Watkins, Sippel, Pietrzak, Hoff, & Harpaz-Rotem, 2017) as well as lower\
      \ \ntreatment retention rates, particularly in people with ASPD and SUD (Meier\
      \ & Barrowclough, 2009). \nEmpirical Evidence of Effectiveness \nEvidence from\
      \ large-scale, longitudinal, multisite treatment studies supports the effectiveness\
      \ of \nresidential SUD treatment (Reif, George, et al., 2014; Weinstein, Wakeman,\
      \ & Nolan, 2018). Residential \nSUD treatment generally results in significant\
      \ improvements in substance use, mental health, \nemployment, and physical and\
      \ social functioning. Residential treatment for CODs is linked to improved \n\
      SUD outcomes (e.g., illicit drug and alcohol use), mental disorder symptoms,\
      \ quality of life, and \nsocial/community functioning, even if treatment is\
      \ not integrated (Reif, George, et al., 2014). A multisite \nstudy of residential\
      \ COD treatment programs in Tennessee and California (Schoenthaler et al., 2017)\
      \ \nfound significant reductions in illicit substance use per month, intoxication\
      \ per month, alcohol use days \nper month, and ASI drug and alcohol composite\
      \ scores from 1 month before treatment admission to 12-\nmonth postdischarge.\
      \  \nDesigning Residential Programs for Clients With CODs \nTo design and develop\
      \ services for clients with CODs, providers and administrators can undertake\
      \ a \nseries of interrelated program activities. The specific MTC model that\
      \ appeared previously in this \nchapter serves as a frame of reference in the\
      \ following sections, but it is not a prescriptive model. \nRelated observations\
      \ are applicable to MTCs that follow this model and to the development of other\
      \ \nresidential programs specific to COD treatment. \nIntake \nChapter 3 further\
      \ addresses screening and assessment. This section addresses intake procedures\
      \ for \npeople with CODs in residential SUD treatment settings. The four interrelated\
      \ steps of intake include: \n1. Written referral. Referral information from\
      \ other programs or services can include the client’s \npsychiatric diagnosis,\
      \ history, current level of mental functioning, medical status (including results\
      \ of \nscreening for tuberculosis, HIV, sexually transmitted disease, and hepatitis),\
      \ and assessment of \nfunctional level. Referrals also may include a psychosocial\
      \ history and a physical examination. \n2. Intake interview. An intake interview\
      \ is conducted at the program site by a counselor or clinical \nteam. At this\
      \ time, the referral material is reviewed for accuracy and completeness, and\
      \ each client \nis interviewed to determine if the referral is appropriate in\
      \ terms of the history of mental and"

      substance use problems. The client’s residential and treatment history is reviewed\
      \ to assess the \nadequacy of past treatment attempts. Furthermore, each client’s\
      \ motivation and readiness for \nchange are assessed, and the client’s willingness\
      \ to accept the current placement as part of the \nrecovery process is evaluated.\
      \ Screening instruments, such as those described in Chapter 3 and \nlocated\
      \ in Appendix C, can be used in conjunction with this intake interview. \n3.\
      \ Program review. Each client should receive a complete description of the program\
      \ and a tour of the \nfacility to ensure that both are acceptable. This review\
      \ includes a description of the daily operation \nof the program in terms of\
      \ groups, activities, and responsibilities; a tour of the physical site \n(including\
      \ sleeping arrangements and communal areas); and an introduction to some of\
      \ the clients \nwho are already enrolled in the program. \n4. Team meeting.\
      \ At the end of the intake interview and program review, the team meets with\
      \ the \nclient to decide whether to proceed with admission to the program. The\
      \ client’s receptivity to the \nprogram is considered, and additional information\
      \ (e.g., involvement with the justice system, suicide \nattempts) is obtained\
      \ as needed. It should be noted that the decision-making process is inclusive;\
      \ \nthat is, a program accepts referrals as long as they meet the eligibility\
      \ criteria, are not currently a \ndanger to self or others, do not refuse medication,\
      \ express a readiness and motivation for \ntreatment, and accept the placement\
      \ and the program as part of their recovery process. \nEngagement and Retention\
      \ \nIt is critical to engage clients with CODs in treatment so they can fully\
      \ use available services. Successful \nengagement helps clients view the treatment\
      \ program as an important resource. To accomplish this, the \nprogram must meet\
      \ essential needs and ensure psychiatric stabilization. Residential treatment\
      \ programs \ncan accomplish this by offering a wide range of services that include\
      \ both targeted services for mental \ndisorders and SUDs and other “wraparound”\
      \ services including medical, social, and work-related \nactivities. The extensiveness\
      \ of residential services has been well documented (Reif, George, et al., \n\
      2014). \nClients in residential settings for SUDs are three times more likely\
      \ to complete treatment than those in \noutpatient settings (Stahler, Mennis,\
      \ & DuCette, 2016). Retention in treatment is associated with \npositive outcomes,\
      \ and identifying factors that predict length of stay can inform practices to\
      \ improve \nengagement and adherence. Shorter stays in residential care are\
      \ linked to older age, male gender, and \nlow readiness for change (Morse, Watson,\
      \ MacMaster, & Bride, 2015). Better retention in residential \nSUD treatment\
      \ settings is linked to younger age, White race/ethnicity (vs. African Americans\
      \ and \nLatinos), type of SUD (i.e., non-OUD), more severe ASI medical-, employment-,\
      \ and psychiatric-related \nscale scores, and greater readiness for change (Choi,\
      \ Adams, MacMaster, & Seiters, 2013). \nDischarge Planning \nDischarge planning\
      \ follows many of the same procedures discussed in the section on outpatient\
      \ \ntreatment. However, there are several other important points for residential\
      \ programs: \n• \nDischarge planning begins upon entry into the program. \n\
      • \nThe latter phases of residential placement should be devoted to developing\
      \ with the client a specific \ndischarge plan and beginning to follow some of\
      \ its features. \n• \nDischarge planning often involves continuing in treatment\
      \ as part of continuity of care. \n• \nObtaining housing, when needed, is an\
      \ integral part of discharge planning. \nGiven the chronic and cyclical nature\
      \ of SUDs and mental disorders, continuing care following residential \nservices\
      \ (such as the provision of lower-intensity outpatient treatment postdischarge)\
      \ can help optimize"

      client stability and functioning. Individuals with SUDs who receive continuing\
      \ care often and maintain \nabstinence more so than clients who do not participate\
      \ in continuing care (McKay, 2009).  \nRecommendations for Continuing Care Following\
      \ Discharge from Residential Treatment \n• Clients should be engaged in continuing\
      \ care services for a minimum of 3 to 6 months following discharge. \n• Scheduling\
      \ of continuing care appointments should occur prior to discharge so that appointments\
      \ are \nalready in place by the time a client leaves inpatient care. \n• To\
      \ facilitate monitoring, programs should implement formal follow-up procedures\
      \ to ensure staff maintain \ncontact with clients regularly at set time points\
      \ (e.g., 30 days, 6 months), ideally for at least 12 months.  \n• Clients should\
      \ be educated about the importance of continuing care and the availability of\
      \ treatment options \nfollowing residential treatment, including the use of\
      \ pharmacotherapy with outpatient services. \n• Residential staff should introduce\
      \ clients to outpatient providers before discharge so as to provide a “warm\
      \ \nhandoff” and foster rapport-building between clients and their continuing\
      \ care providers. \n• Programs should be flexible in offering a wide range of\
      \ continuing care services to meet clients’ scheduling \nand daily living needs\
      \ (e.g., offer outpatient therapy groups 5 days per week, use telehealth services\
      \ so \nclients who live at a distance and unable to travel to outpatient services\
      \ regularly can still access treatment). \n• Counselors should link clients\
      \ to mutual support programs and other community-based supports and \nresources\
      \ available. \nSources: Proctor & Herschman (2014); Rubinsky et al. (2017).\
      \ \nAcute Care and Other Medical Settings \nAlthough not SUD treatment settings\
      \ per se, acute care and other medical settings are included here \nbecause\
      \ important SUD treatment and mental health services do occur in medical units.\
      \ Acute care \nrefers to short-term care provided in intensive care units, brief\
      \ hospital stays, and EDs. Individuals with \nsubstance misuse or mental illness\
      \ often access care from primary care clinics as opposed to specialty \ncare\
      \ settings. Use of EDs for mental and substance-related needs is also on the\
      \ rise. \nHow Common are Mental disorders and SUDs in Acute Care and Other Medical\
      \ Settings? \n• More than 70 percent of primary care visits are related to psychosocial\
      \ needs (National Association of State \nMental Health Program Directors, 2012).\
      \  \n− In a sample of 2,000 adults in primary care clinics in four states, 36\
      \ percent met Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth\
      \ Edition, criteria for an SUD in the last year, including almost 22 percent\
      \ \nwith a moderate/severe SUD (Wu et al., 2017). About 28 percent endorsed\
      \ past-year illicit drug or \nnonmedical medication use. \n− From 2012 to 2014\
      \ (Cherry, Albert, & McCaig, 2018), 26 percent of mental health office visits\
      \ in large \nmetropolitan areas, 44 percent of visits in small-to-medium metropolitan\
      \ areas, and 54 percent of visits in \nrural areas were to primary care. \n\
      • Of the 1.18 billion ambulatory medical visits that occurred between 2009 and\
      \ 2011 (Lagisetty, Maust, Heisler, \n& Bohnert, 2017), 17.6 million involved\
      \ an SUD diagnosis. \n− This included 8.6 percent for AUD, 64.2 percent for\
      \ tobacco use disorder, and 9.6 percent for OUD.  \n− Among the people with\
      \ an SUD, 13.4 percent also had anxiety, 5.7 percent had depression, and 2.3\
      \ \npercent had bipolar disorder. \n• Data from the National Hospital Ambulatory\
      \ Medical Care Survey indicate that from 2005 to 2011, mental \nand substance\
      \ use-related ED visits increased from 27.9 per 1,000 visits to 35.1 per 1,000\
      \ visits, with the \ngreatest increases observed in people ages 25 to 44 (Ayangbayi,\
      \ Okunade, Karakus, & Nianogo, 2017). Odds"

      of visits were higher in people who were uninsured, on public health insurance,\
      \ or discharged from a hospital \nin the previous week.  \n• Individuals with\
      \ CODs are more likely than people without CODs to use EDs for mental disorder\
      \ and SUD-\nrelated needs (Moulin et al., 2018), as are individuals experiencing\
      \ homelessness (Lam, Arora, & Menchine, \n2016). \nThe integration of SUD treatment\
      \ with primary medical care can be effective in reducing both medical \nproblems\
      \ and levels of substance use. Clients can be more readily engaged and retained\
      \ in SUD \ntreatment if that treatment is integrated with medical care than\
      \ if clients are referred to a separate SUD \ntreatment program—especially individuals\
      \ with SUDs who have chronic medical needs (Drainoni et al., \n2014; Hunter,\
      \ Schwartz, & Friedmann, 2016). Extensive treatment for SUDs and co-occurring\
      \ mental \ndisorders may be unavailable in acute care settings given constraints\
      \ on time and resources, brief \nassessments, referrals, and interventions can\
      \ help move clients to the next level of treatment. \nMore information on particular\
      \ topics relating to SUD screening and treatment in acute and medical \ncare\
      \ settings can be found in TIP 45, Detoxification From Alcohol and Other Drugs\
      \ (CSAT, 2006b). More \ninformation on the use and value of brief interventions\
      \ can be found in TIP 34, Brief Interventions and \nBrief Therapies for Substance\
      \ Abuse (CSAT, 1999a). \nPrevalence \nIn 2018, 5 percent of SUD treatment facilities\
      \ in the United States were hospital-based inpatient services \n(SAMHSA, 2019b).\
      \ Specifically, 4 percent of facilities offered hospital-based treatment and\
      \ 5 percent \noffered hospital-based detoxification. In 2018, 40 percent of\
      \ general hospitals offered COD \nprogramming (SAMHSA, 2019c). \nEmpirical Evidence\
      \ of Effectiveness \nOver the past two decades, a plethora of research has emerged\
      \ in support of team-based, integrated \nbehavioral health services in acute\
      \ medical care settings (e.g., EDs, primary care clinics). Collaborative \n\
      behavioral health service models are feasible and can be as effective as (and\
      \ in some cases even more \neffective than) usual care in identifying and managing\
      \ SMI, SUDs, or CODs (Chan, Huang, Bradley, & \nUnutzer, 2014; Chan, Huang,\
      \ Sieu, & Unutzer, 2013; Kumar & Klein, 2013; Park, Cheng, Samet, Winter, &\
      \ \nSaitz, 2015; Walley et al., 2015). Integrated, collaborative behavioral\
      \ health services can improve mental \ndisorder symptoms (including remission\
      \ and recovery), treatment adherence, treatment satisfaction, \nquality of life\
      \ (mental and physical), medication adherence, and social functioning and are\
      \ cost-effective \nand valued by clients (Epstein, Barry, Fiellin, & Busch,\
      \ 2015; Goodrich, Kilbourne, Nord, & Bauer, 2013). \nMost of these studies are\
      \ focused on mental health services, with comparatively fewer examining \nintegrated\
      \ SUD treatment, but research suggests addiction models also are feasible and\
      \ can produce \npositive outcomes (Goodrich et al., 2013), including long-term\
      \ abstinence (Savic, Best, Manning, & \nLubman, 2017). Primary-care-based SUD\
      \ treatment may also help reduce length of inpatient stay and ED \nutilization\
      \ while also increasing recovery coach contacts and use of addiction pharmacotherapy\
      \ (i.e., \nbuprenorphine and naltrexone) (Wakeman et al., 2019).  \nPrimary-care–based\
      \ SUD treatment can reduce gaps in service use by offering treatment in a setting\
      \ \nthat clients prefer. More than 42,000 U.S. adults were screened for SUDs\
      \ to assess willingness to enter \nSUD treatment based on service setting (Barry,\
      \ Epstein, Fiellin, Fraenkel, & Busch, 2016). Those who \nscreened positive\
      \ but were not currently enrolled in SUD treatment were randomized to one of\
      \ three \nhypothetical treatment setting vignettes: treatment in a specialty\
      \ drug treatment center (i.e., usual \ncare), primary care, or collaborative\
      \ care in a primary care setting. About a quarter (24.6 percent) of"

      people with an SUD and 18 percent with AUD who were randomized to specialty\

      The Integration of Care for Mental Health, Substance Abuse and Other Behavioral\
      \ Health Conditions Into \nPrimary Care: American College of Physicians (ACP)\
      \ Position Paper  \n1. The ACP supports the integration of behavioral health\
      \ care into primary care and encourages its members \nto address SUDs and mental\
      \ disorders within the limits of their competencies and resources. \n2. The\
      \ ACP recommends that public and private health insurance payers, policymakers,\
      \ and primary care and \nbehavioral health care professionals work toward removing\
      \ payment barriers that impede behavioral \nhealth and primary care integration.\
      \ Stakeholders should also ensure the availability of adequate financial \n\
      resources to support the practice infrastructure required to effectively provide\
      \ such care. \n3. The ACP recommends that federal and state governments, insurance\
      \ regulators, payers, and other \nstakeholders address behavioral health insurance\
      \ coverage gaps that are barriers to integrated care. This \nincludes strengthening\
      \ and enforcing relevant nondiscrimination laws. \n4. The ACP supports increased\
      \ research to define the most effective and efficient approaches to integrate\
      \ \nbehavioral health care in the primary care setting. \n5. The ACP encourages\
      \ efforts by federal/state governments and training and continuing education\
      \ programs \nto ensure an adequate workforce to provide for integrated behavioral\
      \ health care in primary care settings. \n6. The ACP recommends that all relevant\
      \ stakeholders initiate programs to reduce the stigma associated with \nbehavioral\
      \ health. These programs need to address negative perceptions held by the general\
      \ population \nand by many physicians and other providers. \nSource: Crowley\

      including those that can be used in primary care settings; select instruments\
      \ are also located in \nAppendix C.)  \nAlthough addiction screening can and\
      \ should be offered in both nonurgent as well as urgent medical \ncare settings,\
      \ approaches may need to be implemented differently for each. O’Grady et al.\
      \ (2019) \ndescribe use of a screening, brief intervention and referral for\
      \ treatment program for people with or at \nrisk for addiction that was implemented\
      \ at EDs and primary care clinics. Compared to people screened \nat high risk\
      \ for substance misuse in the primary care clinics, those screened as high risk\
      \ in the EDs were \nsignificantly more likely to also have unstable housing,\
      \ be unemployed, have self-reported “extreme” \nstress, have “serious” depression\
      \ or anxiety, and poor current health. They also reported higher \naddiction\
      \ screening scores and more frequent substance use than people in the primary\
      \ care clinics. \nPrescreening in the EDs was less likely to be completed than\
      \ in primary care because clients were more \nlikely to be in acute states,\
      \ actively intoxicated, or have altered mental status. Further, more than one-\n\
      third of people who prescreened positive for substance misuse did not receive\
      \ full screening and \nintervention. This finding is consistent with results\
      \ from 2 longitudinal surveys of 1,500 ED physicians \nthat found only 15 percent\
      \ to 20 percent of clients were screened for substance misuse and only 19 \n\
      percent to 26 percent of ED physicians reported using a formal addiction screening\
      \ tool (Broderick \nKaplan, Martini, & Caruso, 2015). These data are worrisome,\
      \ given feedback from the American College \nof Emergency Physicians (2017)\
      \ that ED professionals are, “positioned and qualified to mitigate the \nconsequences\
      \ of alcohol misuse through screening programs, brief intervention, and referral\
      \ to \ntreatment” and that EDs should maintain “wide availability of resources\
      \ necessary to address the needs \nof patients with alcohol-related problems\
      \ and those at-risk for them.” ED staff may therefore require \nadditional training\
      \ to better recognize and respond to clients with addiction, particularly those\
      \ with \nsevere disorders. Formal procedures may also be needed to foster successful\
      \ referral and \nimplementation of brief interventions (e.g., education, harm\
      \ reduction).  \nInterventions \nSeveral differences exist in behavioral health\
      \ service provision (including addiction services) in \nmedical settings versus\
      \ traditional mental health service settings (Exhibit 7.4). Acute medical settings\
      \ \nmay be less likely than mental health clinics to have SUD treatment providers\
      \ on staff, unless the setting \noffers integrated care. For this reason, acute\
      \ care and other medical settings should have formal \nprocedures in place so\
      \ providers know when clients require referral for specialty addition treatment\
      \ \nversus in-office brief interventions (e.g., education about substance use,\
      \ harm reduction tips) (Shapiro, \nCoffa, & McCance-Katz, 2013). Pharmacologic\
      \ treatment is likely easier for clients to access in medical \nsettings than\
      \ in mental health centers because of the widespread availability of onsite\
      \ prescribers. \nPharmacologic treatment should be offered based on the latest\
      \ evidence-based best practices (e.g., TIP \n63, Medications for Opioid Use\
      \ Disorder [SAMHSA, 2018c]; VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the \nManagement\
      \ of Substance Use Disorders [VA/DoD, 2015]). See the section “Pharmacotherapy”\
      \ for a full \ndiscussion of medication treatment of people with CODs. \nIn\
      \ integrated settings, treatment planning will often need to occur in collaboration\
      \ with the other team \nproviders (Savic et al., 2017). To this end, providers\
      \ likely will need to engage in greater sharing of \nconfidential client information\
      \ than in nonintegrated, traditional settings to foster case management \nand\
      \ coordination of services (Savic et al., 2017). Clients need to be briefed\
      \ about these limits to \nconfidentiality at intake and their consent documented."

      \ Different options include: \n− Addressing substance use problems only. \n\
      − Addressing substance use in primary care. \n− Addressing all substance use\
      \ and mental disorder needs without primary care. \n− Addressing all substance\
      \ use and mental disorder needs with primary care. \n• Have you developed a\
      \ strategic plan related to integration? \n• Do you /your staff understand the\
      \ primary care and SUD needs of the population you are serving? \n• Do you have\
      \ administrative policies in place to support integration (e.g., confidentiality,\
      \ billing and \nreimbursement, ethics)? \n• What clinical and business practices\
      \ in your organization need to change to facilitate integration? \nCapacity/Resource\
      \ Questions \n• Do you have existing relationships (formal or informal) with\

      \ Administration Center for Integrated Health Solutions (2013). \nHistorically,\
      \ providers in acute care settings have not been concerned with treating SUDs\
      \ beyond \ndetoxification, stabilization, and referral. However, as the uptake\
      \ of brief interventions increases and as \nthe healthcare field’s awareness\
      \ grows about the importance of detecting and treating SUDs and mental \ndisorders,\
      \ treatment options are expanding beyond just stabilization and referral. In\
      \ EDs, case managers \nhelp triage “high users” (which often include people\
      \ with SUDs, mental disorders, or both [Minassian, \nVilke, & Wilson, 2013;\

      \ of care \n(e.g., admission, outpatient referral) (Turner & Stanton, 2015).\
      \ Aspects of case management \ninterventions—which are typically delivered not\
      \ solely by case managers but collaboratively with other \nED team members like\
      \ nurses, physicians, and social workers—that can reduce ED visits, and in some\
      \ \ncases reduce ED costs (Kumar & Klein, 2013) include: \n• \nEducating clients\
      \ about and linking them to community resources to address symptoms/problems.\
      \ \n• \nOffering referral to mental health services and SUD treatment. \n• \n\
      Assisting clients with transportation needs. \n• \nAssisting clients with financial\

      • \nPerforming crisis intervention. \n• \nHelping clients acquire stable housing.\
      \ \n• \nWorking with clients to create an ED treatment plan or other individualized\
      \ care plan. \n• \nFollowing up with clients after discharge, including when\
      \ providing referrals to specialty care. \nInterview-based interventions, like\
      \ motivational interviewing and brief negotiated interviews, decrease \nalcohol\
      \ and illicit drug use in some studies, but other studies have reported inconsistent\
      \ results (Hawk & \nD’Onofrio, 2018). Some research suggests that brief ED interventions\
      \ affect substance use no more than \nminimal screening alone (Bogenschutz et\
      \ al., 2014a), possibly because people presenting to the ED with \nsubstance-related\
      \ problems tend to have higher levels of severity. Overdose education and distribution\
      \ \nof naloxone kits are also being used increasingly in EDs, given the surge\
      \ of evidence demonstrating the \neffectiveness of medication-assisted treatment\
      \ for OUD; however, evidence for their effectiveness in \npreventing overdose\
      \ and substance use over time has yet to be borne out (Hawk & D’Onofrio, 2018).\
      \  \nResearch on the placement of peer recovery support specialists in EDs also\
      \ appears to be promising but \nis still in its nascency (Ashford, Meeks, Curtis,\
      \ & Brown, 2018; Samuels et al., 2018). The AnchorED \nProgram in Rhode Island\
      \ found that, during its first year, use of certified recovery coaches in the\
      \ ED for \npeople experiencing opioid overdose resulted in high engagement of\
      \ recovery support services after \ndischarge (83 percent), including enrollment\
      \ at a local recovery community organization (Joyce & Bailey, \n2015). Only\
      \ 5 percent of people who engaged with the recovery coach experienced repeat\
      \ ED visits. \nFrom 2016 to 2017, 87 percent of people engaged with AnchorED\
      \ recovery coaches after ED discharge, \nand 51 percent accepted service referrals\
      \ (e.g., inpatient treatment program, outpatient treatment \nprogram, medication-assisted\
      \ treatment program) (Waye et al., 2019). However, more evidence is \nneeded\
      \ to elucidate the efficacy and effectiveness of peer-based approaches for ED\
      \ populations. \nPharmacotherapy \nThis TIP does not comprehensively discuss\
      \ pharmacotherapies for SUDs and mental illness. This section \nis an overview\
      \ of medications for certain SUDs (i.e., OUD, AUD) and for mental disorders\
      \ likely to co-\noccur with SUDs. The aim of this section is to educate counselors\
      \ about common medications that \nclients with CODs may be taking and side effects\
      \ they may experience to foster appropriate monitoring \nand treatment planning.\
      \ For indepth discussion of medication for opioid addiction, see TIP 63, \n\
      Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (SAMHSA, 2018c). “Resource Alert: Learning\
      \ More About \nPharmacotherapy and CODs” offers more information about medication\
      \ treatment for CODs. \nMedication for Mental Illness \nMental disorders are\
      \ diseases of the brain or central nervous system. They affect a person’s thinking,\
      \ \nemotions, and mood differently. Medications can relieve distressing symptoms\
      \ and improve functioning \nfor people with mental illness, and they work in\
      \ a variety of ways. Medications may be effective for \nmore than one disorder\
      \ but be referred to by the condition it is most often used to treat. For example,\
      \ a \nmedication may be referred to as an “antidepressant” but also help with\
      \ anxiety or an eating disorder. \nAntipsychotic medications are typically associated\
      \ with diseases like schizophrenia but may also be used \nfor bipolar disorder\
      \ or severe depression. Always ask clients for which condition they take a \n\
      medication; it is hard to determine that based on the name of the medication\
      \ alone. \nA person may have a history of taking different medications in the\
      \ past or may report a change in his or \nher medications while working with\
      \ a counselor. People need different medications depending on how \ntheir illness\
      \ is expressing itself (e.g., which symptoms are most severe or most disabling).\

      used to treat the first episode of a mental illness may be different from those\
      \ used later in disease \ncourse. Age may affect medication selection and dosage;\
      \ aging affects metabolism and the \nbioavailability of some drugs. Sometimes\
      \ a medication becomes less effective over time and will have to \nbe changed\
      \ or another medication added. There may also be periods when no medication\
      \ is used at all.  \nMedication Management \nA person with a mental illness\
      \ should be cared for by a team of providers, which may include a primary \n\
      care provider, a psychiatrist, and a behavioral health professional, such as\
      \ a psychologist, social worker, \nor counselor. Different members of the care\
      \ team may serve as primary contact over time. Medications \nwill typically\
      \ be prescribed by the primary care provider or psychiatrist. The team should\
      \ work together \nto monitor the effects and side effects of the medication.\
      \ Monitoring may include checking blood \npressure, weight, and blood tests.\
      \ \nKnowing When To Refer for Medication Management \nThere are several situations\
      \ in which a nonprescribing professional in behavioral health (e.g., licensed\
      \ clinical \nsocial workers, addiction counselors, most psychologists) will\
      \ need to refer a client for an evaluation to explore \npharmacotherapy options\
      \ and appropriateness. This includes when a client: \n• Has not had success\
      \ improving symptoms or functioning after trying multiple psychotherapies. \n\
      • Has had limited success improving symptoms or functioning with psychotherapy\
      \ but is still experiencing \nsymptoms that are distressing or interfere with\
      \ the person’s functioning. \n• Wants to be abstinent but has had difficulty\
      \ stopping substance use (especially use of opioids or alcohol). \n• Reports\
      \ having previous success with a medication and expresses an interest in trying\
      \ the medication again. \n• Has (or is suspected to have):  \n− Psychotic symptoms\
      \ (e.g., hallucinations, delusions). \n− Schizophrenia. \n− Severe depression\
      \ (especially with suicidal thoughts, behaviors, or attempts). \n− Bipolar disorder\
      \ or mania. \nEqually important is knowing to whom you should refer clients\
      \ for medication evaluation. You should refer to \nprimary care or behavioral\
      \ health professionals with prescribing privileges, such as a: \n• Physician.\
      \ \n• Psychiatrist. \n• Advanced practice registered nurse (especially a psychiatric/mental\
      \ health specialty nurse). \nConsiderations for the SUD Treatment Provider \n\
      A patient who appears sedated, agitated, or intoxicated may be experiencing\
      \ a medication side effect or \nother medical illness. Medications that work\
      \ in the brain are considered “psychotropic”, meaning they \naffect a person’s\
      \ mental state. Drugs of misuse are psychotropic, too. The benefits, side effects,\
      \ and \ndrug interactions of medications for mental illness can affect clients\
      \ similarly to, or look like some of \nthe effects of, illicit substances. This\
      \ may be triggering for the client or those around him or her or lead \nto misuse\
      \ of prescribed medication. Illicit substances and prescribed medications may\
      \ interact with one \nanother, potentially reducing the beneficial effects of\
      \ the prescribed medication (Lindsey, Stewart, & \nChildress, 2012)."

      Medication for Depression  \nMedication can be used to treat major depression\
      \ at all levels of severity; it should be started early and \ncombined with\
      \ psychotherapy (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2010; Schulz & Arora,\
      \ 2015). The \ngoal of medication is to relieve distressing symptoms and help\
      \ restore function.  \nThere are several classes of medications approved for\
      \ the treatment of depression (Food and Drug \nAdministration [FDA], 2017),\
      \ including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin \nnorepinephrine\
      \ reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), and monoamine\
      \ oxidase \ninhibitor (MAOI). Each work in different ways but ultimately treat\
      \ depression by changing the balance of \nchemicals (neurotransmitters) in the\
      \ brain that regulate mood, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and \ndopamine.\
      \ Sometimes medication not specifically approved for depression, such as mood\
      \ stabilizers or \nantipsychotics, will be added to the antidepressant to address\
      \ specific symptoms (FDA, 2017).  \nIn 2019, FDA approved the first ever nasal\
      \ spray antidepressant (FDA, 2019), derived from a pain reliever called \nketamine.\
      \ The spray (esketamine) is specifically for treatment-resistant major depression\
      \ and is designed to \nbegin relieving symptoms very quickly, in a matter of\
      \ hours. Its release represents the first time FDA has \napproved a new antidepressant\
      \ since the medication Prozac entered the market in 1988. \nSide Effects  \n\
      Common side effects when antidepressants are started or when the dose is increased\
      \ are nausea, \nvomiting, and diarrhea (Exhibit 7.6). These usually improve\
      \ in a few weeks. Side effects such as weight \ngain, sleep disturbances, and\
      \ sexual dysfunction can be longer lasting. Some medication side effects may\
      \ \nmimic signs of intoxication or withdrawal or may be triggering for clients.\
      \ Medication for depression \nmight increase suicidal thoughts in young adults\
      \ (i.e., people ages 18 through 24). Some antidepressants \nare associated with\
      \ birth defects or cause the newborn to experience a withdrawal syndrome.  \n\
      Exhibit 7.6. Side Effects of Antidepressants  \nMedication Class \nSide Effects\
      \ \nSSRI \nHigh blood pressure, headache, sexual dysfunction, hyperalertness,\
      \ restlessness, teeth \ngrinding, sweating, internal bleeding, insomnia, nausea/vomiting,\
      \ osteopenia \nSNRI \nDry mouth, sexual dysfunction, hyperalertness, restlessness,\
      \ sweating, insomnia, \nnausea/vomiting, weight gain \nTCA \nIrregular heart\
      \ rhythm, low blood pressure with risk of falls, constipation, dry mouth, \n\
      sweating, sedation, weight gain \nMAOI \nHigh blood pressure, low blood pressure\
      \ with risk of falls, weight gain \nOther \nSeizure, insomnia, nausea/vomiting,\
      \ sedation, weight gain \n \nA Note About Serotonin Syndrome \nSerotonin syndrome\
      \ is a potentially fatal condition caused by too much serotonin (Bartlett, 2017).\
      \ It can occur if \na person takes too much of a prescribed SSRI or SNRI or\
      \ when multiple prescribed medications interact. Over-\nthe-counter cold and\
      \ allergy medications and certain illicit substances (e.g., cocaine, other stimulants,\
      \ opioids) \ncan also cause serotonin syndrome.  \nMild serotonin syndrome can\
      \ look like opioid withdrawal. More serious serotonin syndrome can look like\
      \ \nintoxication with a stimulant or hallucinogen or withdrawal from a benzodiazepine.\
      \ Fever, dangerously high \nblood pressure, and seizure can lead to organ failure\
      \ and death if the syndrome is not recognized and treated."

      Counselors should remain vigilant for and seek medical evaluation for possible\
      \ serotonin syndrome when clients \nwith CODs present with unexpected withdrawal\
      \ or intoxication symptoms. \nMedication for Anxiety Disorders \nAnxiety disorders\
      \ are best treated with combined psychotherapy and medication (Benich, Bragg,\
      \ & \nFreedy, 2016). Medication can help relieve distressing symptoms. Antidepressants\
      \ and benzodiazepines \nare the most common classes of FDA-approved medication\
      \ for anxiety. Antidepressants in the SSRI and \nSNRI classes are considered\
      \ first-line therapy. Benzodiazepines should generally be used only for short\
      \ \nperiods, taken per a schedule rather than as needed (Benich et al., 2016).\
      \ Taking benzodiazepines with \nopioids markedly increases the risk of overdose\
      \ (NIDA, Revised March 2018).  \nBenzodiazepines can cause dependence after\
      \ relatively brief periods of regular use. People dependent \non benzodiazepines\
      \ will experience withdrawal if they stop taking them abruptly.  \nSide effects\
      \ of antidepressants prescribed for anxiety are the same those for depression\
      \ (Exhibit 7.6). \nBenzodiazepines carry an increased risk of central nervous\
      \ system depression, which can lead to \nsedation, fatigue, dizziness, and impaired\
      \ driving ability (Bandelow, Michaelis, & Wedekind, 2017). Older \nadults taking\
      \ benzodiazepines can have negative changes in cognition, such as memory, learning,\
      \ and \nattention. Older adults taking benzodiazepines are thus at an increased\
      \ risk of falls and fracture \n(Markota, Rummans, Bostwick, & Lapid, 2016).\
      \  \nMedication for PTSD  \nMedication combined with psychotherapy can be effective\
      \ in relieving symptoms of PTSD (VA/DoD, \n2017). Two SSRIs are FDA approved\
      \ for the treatment of PTSD. Studies are also underway to explore the \nbenefit\
      \ of using certain antipsychotics in PTSD.  \nMedication for Bipolar Disorder\
      \  \nBipolar disorder is typically managed with both medication and psychotherapy,\
      \ given its life-long course \nand need for continuous treatment (SAMHSA, 2016).\
      \ The goal of medication in bipolar disorder is to \nprevent or suppress mania\
      \ while relieving depression (Fountoulakis et al., 2017). Sometimes people will\
      \ \nhave already begun treatment for depression when mania presents for the\
      \ first time. When this \nhappens, the antidepressant may be stopped and restarted\
      \ later. Medications used to treat bipolar \ndisorder are often referred to\
      \ as “mood stabilizers.” This is not a single class of medication but a group\
      \ \nof different types of medications that reduce the abnormal brain activity\
      \ that causes mania and rapidly \nchanging mood states. Mood stabilizers, antiseizure\
      \ medications, and antipsychotic medications may be \nused to treat bipolar\
      \ disorder; sometimes these medications are used in combination.  \nMood Stabilizers\
      \ \nMedication to prevent severe mood fluctuations can be effective at treating\
      \ mania, particularly the first-\nline medication lithium (Fountoulakis et al.,\
      \ 2017). Mood stabilizers treat and prevent mania by \ndecreasing abnormal activity\
      \ in the brain. People taking lithium need to see a physician regularly for\
      \ \nmonitoring of blood levels and kidney and thyroid functioning. Side effects\
      \ that may improve with time \nare nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle weakness,\
      \ fatigue, and feeling “dazed.” Other symptoms are \nlikely to continue, such\
      \ as fine tremor, frequent urination, and thirst. Lithium can cause skin disorders\
      \ \nThe pharmacist from whom a client gets his or her prescriptions may be a\
      \ helpful source of information if \ncounselors have concerns or questions about\
      \ side effects or drug interactions."

      like acne, psoriasis, and rashes. Serious side effects include irregular heart\
      \ rhythm and serotonin \nsyndrome. Anesthesia and antidepressants are associated\
      \ with serotonin syndrome when taken with \nlithium. Elevated blood levels of\
      \ lithium can cause uncontrollable shaking, clumsiness, ringing in the \nears,\
      \ slurred speech, and blurred vision. Salt, caffeine, alcohol, other medications,\
      \ and dosing mistakes \ncan cause lithium toxicity, which can be a medical emergency.\
      \  \nAntiseizure Medication  \nAntiepileptic medications can be used to treat\
      \ bipolar disorder (Fountoulakis et al., 2017; National \nInstitute of Mental\
      \ Health [NIMH], 2016). These medications may have both benign and life-threatening\
      \ \nside effects, including rash, damage to internal organs, and a decrease\
      \ in blood cells (e.g., platelets, \nwhite blood cells). These medications can\
      \ interact negatively with medications used to treat common \nmedical concerns,\
      \ such as diabetes and high blood pressure. They also can make hormonal \ncontraceptives\
      \ less effective. Other serious side effects include peeling or blistering of\
      \ the skin, bruising, \nbleeding, weakness, headache, stiff neck, chest pain,\
      \ nausea/vomiting, vision changes, swelling of the \nface/eyes/lips, dark urine,\
      \ yellowing of the skin or eyes, abnormal heartbeat, loss of appetite, and \n\
      abdominal pain. Common but less-serious side effects include blurred or double\
      \ vision, dizziness, \nuncontrollable movements, sleepiness, weight change,\
      \ ringing in the ears, hair loss, back, stomach or \njoint pain, painful menstrual\
      \ periods, confusion, difficulty speaking, and dry mouth. \nAntipsychotic Medication\
      \  \nAntipsychotic medication may be used to treat mania with psychosis. See\
      \ the section “Medication for \nSchizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders”\
      \ for detailed information about the medications.  \nMedication for Schizophrenia\
      \ and Other Psychotic Disorders \nAntipsychotics are the most common medications\
      \ for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (Lally \n& MacCabe, 2015;\
      \ Patel, Cherian, Gohil, & Atkinson, 2014). They have many side effects and\
      \ require \ncareful monitoring. Most are taken daily, but there are a few long-lasting\
      \ forms that can be \nadministered once or twice a month.  \nThere are two categories\
      \ of antipsychotics: “first-generation” or “typical” antipsychotics and “second-\n\
      generation” or “atypical” antipsychotics. Both types can be used to help treat\
      \ schizophrenia and mania \nbecause of bipolar disorder. Some antipsychotics\
      \ have a wider range of uses, including severe \ndepression, generalized anxiety\
      \ disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, dementia, and delirium. \n\
      Symptoms such as agitation and hallucinations may remit within a few days of\
      \ starting the medication, \nwhereas delusions may take a few weeks to resolve.\
      \ The full effect of an antipsychotic may not be seen \nfor up to 6 weeks. A\
      \ person may need to stay on the antipsychotic for months or years to stay well.\
      \  \nSide Effects \nAll antipsychotics have the potential to cause side effects\
      \ such as drowsiness, dizziness, restlessness, dry \nmouth, constipation, nausea,\
      \ vomiting, blurred vision, low blood pressure, and uncontrollable muscle \n\
      movements (NIMH, 2016). People who take antipsychotics need to have their blood\
      \ cell counts, blood \nglucose, and cholesterol monitored by a healthcare provider.\
      \ Care should be taken when starting or \nstopping other medications because\
      \ there are many potential drug interactions and not all are known. \nTobacco\
      \ smoke affects how medications are absorbed, spread through the body, work,\
      \ are metabolized, and \neliminated by the body (Lucas & Martin, 2013). Changing\
      \ the amount of tobacco smoked, including stopping or \nstarting, can interfere\
      \ with medication effectiveness or risk of side effects."

      The typical or first-generation antipsychotics may cause rigidity and muscle\
      \ spasms, tremors, and \nrestlessness. They may also cause a condition of abnormal\
      \ muscle movements called tardive dyskinesia, \nwhich can persist even when\
      \ the medication is discontinued. Some antipsychotics cause \nelectrocardiogram\
      \ abnormalities, such as QT prolongation. It is possible to overdose on antipsychotics,\
      \ \nespecially if they are combined with alcohol or other sedating drugs. \n\
      Medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  \nAttention deficit\
      \ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults may be treated with short- or long-acting\
      \ \nstimulants, nonstimulant medications, and behavioral therapy (NIMH, 2016).\
      \ Typically, a nonstimulant \nmedication is prescribed first; a stimulant, only\
      \ if nonstimulant response is insufficient. Stimulant \nmedications help people\
      \ with ADHD focus and feel calmer but can cause euphoria (SAMHSA, 2015a).  \n\
      Stimulants may be misused by people who have no prescription. Typically, people\
      \ who misuse \nstimulants are motivated to improve academic/work performance\
      \ and hope to experience enhanced \nconcentration and alertness rather than\
      \ euphoria. Many people who consistently misuse prescription \nstimulants exhibit\
      \ symptoms of ADHD. Adults who are prescribed stimulants for ADHD may misuse\
      \ them \nby taking larger doses than prescribed. There is some evidence that\
      \ adults who misuse stimulants \nprescribed to them are more likely to report\
      \ misuse of other substances as well (Wilens et al., 2016).  \nThere are no\
      \ specific guidelines on whether stimulants should be prescribed for co-occurring\
      \ ADHD in \npeople with SUDs. Available research is unclear as to whether stimulants\
      \ are effective for ADHD in the \npresence of an SUD. Although efficacious in\
      \ reducing ADHD symptoms, stimulant medications generally \ndo not alleviate\
      \ SUD symptoms (Cunill et al., 2015; De Crescenzo et al., 2017; Luo & Levin,\
      \ 2017). Thus, \nADHD medication alone, if used at all, is an insufficient treatment\
      \ approach for ADHD-SUD (Crunelle et \nal., 2018; Zulauf et al., 2014). Stimulants\
      \ do have misuse potential, but current evidence suggests that \nmost people\
      \ with ADHD and SUD generally do not divert or misuse stimulant medication for\
      \ ADHD (e.g., \nto experience euphoria) (Luo & Levin, 2017). However, diversion\
      \ can and does occur in some people. \nUse of long-acting or extended-release\
      \ medication or of antidepressants instead of stimulants can help \nreduce the\
      \ chances of diversion and misuse.  \nMedications for ADHD can have potentially\
      \ life-threatening cardiovascular side effects (Sinha, Lewis, \nKumar, Yeruva,\
      \ & Curry, 2016). Changes in heart rhythm and blood pressure can occur that\
      \ raise risk of \nstroke and heart attack, especially in adults with preexisting\
      \ heart conditions (Zukkoor, 2015). These \nmedications should be prescribed\
      \ cautiously and with consideration of the client’s personal and family \nhistory\
      \ of cardiovascular problems. Combined medication and psychotherapy may provide\
      \ the best \nlong-term relief of ADHD symptoms (Arnold, Hodgkins, Caci, Kahle,\
      \ & Young, 2015). \nMedication for PDs \nNo medications are FDA approved to\
      \ treat any PD. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, \nand antianxiety\
      \ medications can be prescribed to target symptoms/improve function. \nMedication\
      \ for Feeding and Eating Disorders \nMedication is generally not a first-line\
      \ or standalone treatment approach for eating disorders, and only \none medication—the\
      \ SSRI fluoxetine (Prozac)—is approved by the FDA to treat these conditions\
      \ \n(specifically, bulimia nervosa [BN]) (Davis & Attia, 2017). Other antidepressants\
      \ may be effective for the \nmanagement of BN and binge eating disorder (BED)\
      \ but have been relatively less successful with \nanorexia nervosa (AN; Davis\
      \ & Attia, 2017). Second-generation antipsychotics (notably olanzapine) may\
      \ \noffer a promising pharmacotherapy option for AN, but more research is needed\
      \ (Davis & Attia, 2017)."

      Certain stimulants known to suppress appetite have shown some success with reducing\
      \ symptoms of \nBED (Davis & Attia, 2017).  \nMedication for SUDs \nBecause\
      \ SUDs are brain-based diseases, pharmacologic research has explored the development\
      \ of \nagents that can effectively target disruptions in neurotransmitters and\
      \ neuromodulators that occur as a \npart of addiction. These medications often\
      \ help reduce withdrawal symptoms or craving, which in turn \ncan make abstinence\
      \ easier to achieve and sustain. In general, pharmacotherapy for SUDs is considered\
      \ \nsupportive rather than curative and is typically combined with psychotherapy,\
      \ behavioral counseling, \npsychoeducation, mutual support, other recovery services,\
      \ or a combination of these. \nThe sections that follow briefly discuss medications\
      \ for AUD and OUD. There are currently no FDA-\napproved pharmacotherapies for\
      \ cocaine, methamphetamine, or cannabis use disorders. Clinicians \noften use\
      \ FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapy and nonnicotine medications to manage\
      \ tobacco \nuse disorder. Tobacco use is outside the scope of this TIP, so these\
      \ pharmacotherapies are not \ndiscussed. Readers interested in learning more\
      \ can review FDA’s guidance about medication to support \ntobacco cessation\
      \ (www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm198176.htm).  \nMedication use\
      \ by people battling addiction has been controversial given attitudes by some\
      \ providers and \nmutual support programs, like AA and Narcotics Anonymous,\
      \ that view medication use as incompatible with \nabstinence and therefore not\
      \ a valid part of recovery. Counselors should be sensitive to this and educate\
      \ clients \nabout the potential value of medication as well as possible negative\
      \ reactions they might face from some \nmutual support programs and addiction\
      \ professionals. \nMedication is not a cure for addiction and is not right for\
      \ everyone. But the science is clear: in certain \ninstances (e.g., for OUD),\
      \ pharmacotherapy can not only help improve lives, it can help save them as\
      \ well. \nMedication for AUD \nThree medications are FDA approved for AUD (disulfiram,\
      \ acamprosate, and naltrexone), and each have \ndifferent mechanisms of action.\
      \ These include disincentivizing use by causing unpleasant side effects \n(e.g.,\
      \ nausea, headache, vomiting) when alcohol is consumed (disulfiram); blocking\
      \ the euphoric effects \nof intoxication (naltrexone); and normalizing neurotransmitter\
      \ activity that is dysregulated in addiction \nand during withdrawal (acamprosate).\
      \ Other medications, including anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and \nantidepressants,\
      \ can help reduce consumption and craving and potentially help support abstinence\
      \ \n(Akbar, Egli, Cho, Song, & Noronha, 2018). \nMedication for OUD \nUnlike\
      \ AUD and other SUDs, pharmacotherapy (with or without adjunctive psychosocial\
      \ treatment) is \nthe recommended approach to managing OUD. Ample research strongly\
      \ supports the effectiveness of \nmedication-assisted treatment for OUD in increasing\
      \ abstinence, preventing or reversing overdose, \nreducing risk of relapse,\
      \ and mitigating negative outcomes associated with opioid addiction, like \n\
      infectious diseases and incarceration (SAMHSA, 2018c). FDA-approved medications\
      \ for OUD include \nmethadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. In addition, the\
      \ FDA-approved rescue medication naloxone \ncan rapidly reverse opioid overdose\
      \ and prevent fatality. Readers should consult TIP 63, Medications for \nOpioid\
      \ Use Disorder (SAMHSA, 2018c), for extensive information about opioid pharmacotherapy\
      \ and its \nrole in helping clients manage symptoms and achieve long-term recovery."

      Resource Alert: Learning More About Pharmacotherapy and CODs \nPharmacology\
      \ interventions can be safe and effective for many individuals with CODs. Although\
      \ prescribing is \noutside the practice of addiction counselors, licensed clinical\
      \ social workers, and most psychologists, it \nbehooves all providers to become\
      \ familiar with common psychotropic medications, their side effects, and their\
      \ \npotential risks. Following are several resources to help nonprescribing\
      \ behavioral health service providers learn \nmore about pharmacotherapy for\
      \ mental disorders and SUDs: \n• SAMHSA’s TIP 63, Medications for Opioid Use\

      \ are available and can be adapted to the specific needs of people with CODs,\
      \ including their \nsymptoms as well as their stages of change and readiness\
      \ to engage in services. Because the disease \ncourse of SUDs and mental disorders\
      \ is often unstable and unpredictable, counselors must be ready to \noffer COD-appropriate\
      \ interventions across all settings, including nontraditional settings like\
      \ jails and \nprisons. Continuous, integrated treatment modalities that link\
      \ clients with resources and supports in the \ncommunity give people with addiction\

      \ Have Co-Occurring Disorders \n \nPage 234 \nChapter 8—Workforce and Administrative\
      \ \nConcerns in Working With People Who Have  \nCo-Occurring Disorders  \n(For\
      \ Supervisors and Administrators) \nAvailability, quality, and cost of SUD treatment\
      \ and mental health services are intricately tied to the \ncurrent state of\
      \ the behavioral health workforce. Without a robust, sizeable labor force, how\
      \ will people \nwith mental disorders and addiction problems have their needs\
      \ met? Without enough trainees entering \nthe field or staff willing to stay\
      \ in their jobs long term, how will addiction and mental health service \norganizations\
      \ keep their doors open? What sort of ripple effects might an understaffed or\
      \ ill-prepared \nworkforce have on our healthcare system, economy, and society\
      \ as a whole? \nRather than serve as a primer on labor difficulties in the mental\
      \ health and addiction fields, this chapter \nprovides an informative update\
      \ on the current state of mental health and addictions professions. The \ngoal\
      \ is to help supervisors, administrators, and other organizational leadership\
      \ understand aspects of \nthe workforce relevant to their organization’s ability\
      \ to provide quality, cost effective, evidence-based \nservices for CODs and\
      \ help them feel better prepared to address workforce gaps in their own agency.\
      \ \nThis chapter is divided into two main sections:  \n• \nThe first half addresses\
      \ recruitment, hiring, and retention in the behavioral health workforce. \n\
      Finding, getting, and keeping the right employees is critical to ensuring the\
      \ long-term sustainability, \nviability, and effectiveness of the field. In\
      \ support of this endeavor, the chapter contains links to \npractical web-based\
      \ resources for programs and administrators, including toolkits and manuals.\
      \ \n• \nAs important to a program as acquiring and retaining employees is ensuring\
      \ the competency and \nprofessional development of its staff. This is the focus\
      \ of the second half of this chapter. This section \nincludes detailed discussions\
      \ about the role of training, supervision, and credentialing, all of which \n\
      Key Messages \nMental health and addiction labor force problems directly affect\
      \ treatment access, quality, and cost. Without \naddressing gaps in personnel\
      \ and training, the behavioral health field will struggle to meet the needs\
      \ of the \ngrowing numbers of people living with co-occurring disorders (CODs).\
      \ \nAlthough current workforce challenges may seem daunting, substance use disorder\
      \ (SUD) treatment supervisors \nand administrators can help confront and overcome\
      \ these difficulties by creating, implementing, and sustaining \nprofessional\
      \ development and training opportunities within their organizations. This in\
      \ turn will help support \nthe uptake and utilization of best practices. \n\
      Recruitment and retention priorities are urgently needed because of the challenging\
      \ nature of the addiction and \nmental health service professions, which lead\
      \ to high rates of staff burnout and turnover.  \nProfessional education and\
      \ accreditation strategies, combined with mentoring and supervision, can help\
      \ \nincrease adoption of core and advanced clinical competencies, increase providers’\
      \ comfort with working with \npeople who have CODs, reduce stigma surrounding\
      \ the profession/field, and provide structured career \ndevelopment."

      \ \n \nPage 235 \nare necessary components of preparing the field to deliver\
      \ evidence-based care and fostering \nincreased service provision. \nNote that\
      \ general guidelines aimed at supervisors and administrators serving people\
      \ with CODs are in \nChapter 2 and information about implementing various treatment\
      \ models and settings is in Chapter 7.  \nThis chapter discusses training needs\
      \ for addiction counselors working with clients who have CODs. However, \nany\
      \ behavioral health service provider in any setting (e.g., primary care, a social\
      \ worker’s office, SUD \ntreatment, a psychologist’s/psychiatrist’s office)\
      \ should have the skills and competencies to recognize CODs and \nprovide at\
      \ least a basic screening that encompasses CODs, with enough knowledge of community\
      \ resources to \nrefer for integrated COD treatment if the provider can’t provide\
      \ such treatment himself/herself. \nRecruitment, Hiring, and Retention  \nAs\
      \ of January 2019, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has\
      \ identified \napproximately 5,125 mental health professional shortage areas\
      \ in the United States, requiring 6,894 \nmental health practitioners to fill\
      \ the shortage (HRSA, 2019). The behavioral health workforce is fraught \nwith\
      \ profession gaps and similar challenges that serve as barriers to treatment\
      \ access for people with \nmental disorders and SUDs. For instance (Olfson,\
      \ 2016; Weil, 2015): \n• \nFormal education in psychology and psychiatry is\
      \ time consuming and costly, making it harder to \nrecruit and retain trainees.\
      \ \n• \nThe number of medical trainees specializing in psychiatry is shrinking.\
      \ \n• \nWithin psychiatry, types of services provided are variable (e.g., medication\
      \ management only vs. \npsychotherapy and pharmacotherapy). \n• \nPsychiatrists\
      \ are less likely to accept Medicaid than other medical specialties, which is\
      \ particularly \ndamaging to individuals with serious mental illness (SMI),\
      \ like schizophrenia, who often require \npublic assistance. Psychologists also\
      \ are unlikely to accept Medicaid given low reimbursement rates. \n• \nPsychologists\
      \ and psychiatrists tend to be disproportionately clustered in certain geographic\
      \ \nregions, leaving shortages in rural areas (vs. more affluent urban and suburban\
      \ areas) and particular \nregions of the United States (e.g., Midwest, Deep\
      \ South). \n• \nPeople with SMI are grossly underserved due in part to factors\
      \ like lack of formal training \nopportunities in SMI and low provider comfort\
      \ with working with these populations. \n• \nSocial workers and primary care\
      \ providers can help fill critical workforce and service gaps left by \npsychiatry\
      \ and psychology (particularly in treating clients with SMI), but this will\
      \ require additional \ntraining in behavioral health assessment, diagnosis,\
      \ and treatment and better compensation. \nA focus group of mental health and\
      \ SUD treatment providers identified organizational and system-related \nfactors\
      \ they believed hindered their ability to adequately care for clients with CODs\
      \ (Padwa, Guerrero, Braslow, \n& Fenwick, 2015): \n• Lack of support for COD\
      \ services, such as low allocation of resources, discontinuing consultations\
      \ with \noutside COD experts, discontinuing onsite drug testing of clients,\
      \ and not implementing integrated care \nprocedures even when already developed\
      \ by staff \n• Lack of COD training opportunities  \n• An inability to bill\
      \ for CODs (e.g., certain organizations would only permit billing for mental\
      \ health services \nand not SUD treatment)"

      \ \n \nPage 236 \n• Lack of local addiction services, which make coordinating\
      \ care, referring clients to specialty services, and \nlinking clients to needed\
      \ resources more difficult. Even when these services are present, available\
      \ slots are \nlimited and wait-times are often long. \n• Large caseloads and\
      \ limited time to work with clients \n• Difficulty initiating and maintaining\
      \ contact with outside SUD treatment providers, especially with providers \n\
      in residential treatment settings \n• Fragmented, nonintegrated care that results\
      \ in different providers using different (and sometimes opposing) \ntreatment\
      \ approaches with the same client. This is particularly problematic when clients\
      \ on \npharmacotherapy attend mutual support groups or treatment programs that\
      \ strongly discourage \npsychotropic medication. \nRecruitment and Retention\
      \  \nThe documented workforce shortage in SUD treatment and mental health services\
      \ underscores the \nneed for aggressive, effective, and even creative recruitment\
      \ and hiring strategies and policies. \nExtended vacancies in behavioral health\
      \ service positions leave programs—and the clients they serve—\nvulnerable to\
      \ negative outcomes like further turnover, high stress, low morale, and fragmented,\
      \ \nineffective care.  \nThe ability to recruit and hire quality, long-term\
      \ employees first requires attracting the right candidates. \nJob postings and\
      \ advertisements in multiple outlets, such as websites, on social media, at\
      \ job fairs, in \nnewspapers, and within the community, can increase exposure\
      \ and widen the potential pool of \napplications. Less traditional but nonetheless\
      \ effective places to advertise include churches, synagogues, \nand other faith-based\
      \ organizations; community welfare agencies and housing offices; shopping centers;\
      \ \nand health clinics and senior centers. Staff referral incentives encourage\
      \ current employees to act as \nrecruiters and also helps increase retention.\
      \ \nExhibit 8.1. outlines steps from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\
      \ Administration’s \n(SAMHSA’s) Recruitment and Retention Toolkit, designed\
      \ to aid behavioral health organizations in \nbuilding more effective recruitment,\
      \ hiring, and retention practices. The toolkit offers a six-step \napproach\
      \ and includes numerous resources (e.g., templates, samples, worksheets) to\
      \ guide programs at \neach step (see “Resource Alert: Recruitment and Retention\
      \ Toolkits”). \nExhibit 8.1. Building an Effective Recruitment and Retention\
      \ Plan for Behavioral Health \nService Providers \n• Step 1. Gather organizational\
      \ baseline information. Before programs can effectively recruit and hire the\
      \ \nright personnel, they first need to assess the landscape: What are the current\
      \ retention rates for healthcare \nproviders? What previously used recruitment\
      \ and hiring strategies have proved effective and ineffective for \nthe field?\
      \ What can be learned about job satisfaction from exit interviews? \n• Step\
      \ 2. Decide on a priority recruitment and retention focus (job position). Programs\
      \ should gather and \nanalyze data to identify their most pressing hiring needs\
      \ and challenges. This should result in programs \nselecting the most urgent\
      \ priority position to fill. \n• Step 3. Analyze the selected job position.\
      \ Once a priority position is selected from Step 2, programs need to \nidentify\
      \ the benefits and challenges of the position so as to develop a clear and accurate\
      \ position description. \n• Step 4. Write an accurate job description. The position\
      \ description needs to be articulate, direct, and \nthorough to attract the\
      \ best fitting, most-qualified candidates possible."

      \  \nReducing Staff Turnover  \nBehavioral health service provider turnover\
      \ and burnout can strain organizational infrastructure, \nprevent clients from\
      \ receiving much-needed services, and weaken the field as a whole. The Department\
      \ \nof Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates a national turnover rate\
      \ across all professions of around \n3.7 percent (Bureau of Labor Statistics,\
      \ October 9, 2019). By comparison, turnover in the behavioral \nhealth field\
      \ is quite high. Among addiction counselors and supervisors, average annual\
      \ turnover has \nbeen estimated to range between 23 percent and 33 percent (Eby,\
      \ Burk, & Maher, 2010; Knight, \nBroome, Edwards, & Flynn, 2011; Laschober &\
      \ Eby, 2013) and between approximately 17 percent and \n26 percent among mental\
      \ health therapists and supervisors (Beidas et al., 2016; Bukach, Ejaz, Dawson,\
      \ \n& Gitter, 2017). In both sectors, turnover is usually voluntary—an additional\
      \ cause for concern. Reasons \nfor behavioral health service providers to leave\
      \ their jobs voluntarily include burnout (driven by factors \nlike high workload\
      \ and not having a clear understanding of job roles and duties), receiving low\
      \ levels of \nsupport from supervisors and coworkers, and job dissatisfaction\
      \ (related to high workload and poor \nsupervisory relationships) (Garner &\
      \ Hunter, 2014; Yanchus, Periard, & Osatuke, 2017; Young, 2015). \n(Also see\
      \ the section “Burnout.”)  \nTurnover is destabilizing to an agency for numerous\
      \ reasons (Young, 2015). Turnover often negatively \naffects an organization’s\
      \ capacity to serve clients, efficiency, profit-earning potential, operational\
      \ \nspending, and staff morale and stress levels. The issue of staff turnover\
      \ is especially important for \nprofessionals working with clients who have\
      \ CODs because of the limited workforce pool and the high \ninvestment of time\
      \ and effort involved in developing a trained workforce. It matters, too, because\
      \ of the \ncrucial importance of the treatment relationship to successful outcomes.\
      \ Rapid turnover disrupts the \ncontext in which recovery occurs. Clients in\
      \ such agencies may become discouraged about the possibility \nof being helped\
      \ by others.  \nTurnover sometimes results from the unique professional and\
      \ emotional demands of working with \nclients who have CODs. On the other hand,\
      \ most providers in this area are very dedicated and find the"

      \ \n \nPage 238 \nwork to be rewarding. Evidence suggests that turnover may\
      \ be connected to providers’ feelings of \npreparedness to serve clients with\
      \ CODs. SUD treatment providers who leave an organization but stay in \nthe\
      \ field (program turnover) are more likely to have formal education, training,\
      \ and experience in SUDs \nthan addiction counselors who leave an organization\
      \ and withdraw from the field entirely (profession \nturnover) (Eby, Laschober,\
      \ & Curtis, 2014). This suggests that programmatic training and professional\
      \ \ndevelopment could help strengthen not only the individual agency but the\
      \ workforce as a whole.  \nTurnover in the addiction field is linked to attitudinal\
      \ and organizational predictors, including lower job \nsatisfaction, lower job\
      \ involvement, lower support from supervisors or coworkers, and poor role \n\
      manageability (Garner & Hunter, 2014). These factors are largely modifiable\
      \ and are important targets \nfor monitoring and implementing programmatic changes\
      \ to help providers feel satisfied, supported, and \ncompetent on the job (Yanchus\
      \ et al., 2017). Exhibit 8.2 offers methods for reducing staff turnover. \n\
      \ \nAvoiding Burnout \nA logical approach to reducing turnover is to prevent\
      \ the occurrence of burnout. Burnout has been \nreported in as much as 67 percent\
      \ of professionals in the mental health field (Morse, Salyers, Rollins, \nMonroe-DeVita,\
      \ & Pfahler, 2012). Reasons mirror those for turnover, including, but not limited\
      \ to, \ndemanding workloads and not feeling rewarded by one’s work (Young 2015).\
      \ Often, mental health \nservice and SUD treatment providers are expected to\
      \ manage growing and more complex caseloads. \n“Compassion fatigue” may occur\
      \ when the pressures of work erode a counselor’s spirit and outlook and \nbegin\
      \ to interfere with the counselor’s personal life; see also Treatment Improvement\
      \ Protocol (TIP) 36, \nSubstance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Child Abuse\
      \ and Neglect Issues (Center for Substance \nExhibit 8.2. Reducing Staff Turnover\
      \ in Programs for Clients With CODs \nTo decrease staff turnover, whenever possible,\
      \ programs should: \n• Hire staff members who have familiarity with both SUDs\
      \ and mental disorders and have a positive regard for \nclients with either\
      \ disorder. \n• Hire staff members who are critically minded and can think independently,\
      \ but who are also willing to ask \nquestions and listen, remain open to new\
      \ ideas, maintain flexibility, work cooperatively, and engage in \ncreative\
      \ problem-solving. \n• Provide staff with a framework of realistic expectations\
      \ for the progress of clients with CODs. \n• Establish reasonable client caseloads\
      \ and scheduled time during work hours to follow-up with case \nmanagement matters\
      \ and paperwork. \n• Provide opportunities for consultation among staff members\
      \ who share the same client (including \nmedication providers). \n• Ensure that\
      \ supervisory staff are supportive and knowledgeable about areas specific to\
      \ clients with CODs. \n• Provide and support opportunities for further education\
      \ and training. \n• Provide structured opportunities for staff feedback in the\
      \ areas of program design and implementation. \n• Solicit feedback from staff\
      \ about their perceptions of the work environment, including levels of support,\
      \ \ncivility, resource needs, and relationships with supervisors. \n• Conduct\
      \ exit interviews with departing employees to gather perspectives on areas for\
      \ improvement. \n• Promote knowledge of, and advocacy for, CODs among administrative\
      \ staff, including those in decision making \npositions (e.g., directors) and\
      \ others (e.g., financial officers, billing personnel, State reporting monitors).\
      \ \n• Provide a desirable work environment through adequate compensation, salary\
      \ incentives for COD expertise, \nopportunities for training and for career\
      \ advancement, involvement in quality improvement or clinical \nresearch activities,\
      \ and efforts to adjust workloads."

      \ \n \nPage 239 \nAbuse Treatment [CSAT], 2000c, p. 64). Assisting clients who\
      \ have CODs is difficult and emotionally \ntaxing; the danger of burnout is\
      \ considerable. It is especially important that program administrators \nmaintain\
      \ awareness of the problem of burnout and the benefits of reducing turnover.\
      \ It is vital that staff \nfeel that program administrators are interested in\
      \ their well-being in order to sustain morale and esprit \nde corps. \nTo lessen\
      \ counselor burnout when working with a demanding caseload that includes clients\
      \ with CODs, \nbehavioral health organizations should (Atkinson, Rodman, Thuras,\
      \ Shiroma, & Lime, 2017; Oser, Biebel, \nPullen, & Harp, 2013; Morse et al.,\
      \ 2012): \n• \nCreate a collegial environment for staff, particularly by encouraging\
      \ support between coworkers. \n• \nIncrease the amount of supervision given\
      \ to staff, not only for skill building but because supervision \ncan serve\
      \ as another outlet for emotional support and encouragement much needed by providers.\
      \ \n• \nAdvocate for and help staff cultivate self-care and self-compassion.\
      \ For instance, provide staff with \ncognitive–behavioral interventions to improve\
      \ their coping skills, foster positive attitudes, and \nincrease relaxation,\
      \ and promote mindfulness. \n• \nDecrease workloads, increase provider autonomy,\
      \ and clarify roles and expectations. \nResource Alert: Dealing With Stress\
      \ in Behavioral Health Service Settings \nSAMHSA’s Recruitment and Retention\

      \  \nCompetency and Professional Development \nThis section focuses on some\
      \ key areas programs face in developing a workforce able to meet the needs \n\
      of clients with CODs. These include: \n• \nThe attitudes and values providers\
      \ must have to work successfully with these clients. \n• \nEssential competencies\
      \ for providers (basic, intermediate, and advanced). \n• \nOpportunities for\
      \ continuing professional development as well as professional licensure. \n\
      Areas of weakness exist in many COD programs’ services, staff training/supervision,\
      \ and staff \ncompetencies (Petrakis, Robinson, Myers, Kroes, & O’Connor, 2018).\
      \ Of 256 U.S. addiction treatment \nand mental health service programs surveyed\
      \ (McGovern et al., 2014), only 18 percent of SUD programs \nand 9 percent of\
      \ mental disorder programs were COD “capable.” In a survey of 30 publicly funded\
      \ COD \nprograms (Padwa et al., 2013): \n• \nAbout 43 percent met or exceeded\
      \ criteria for COD “capable” programming. \n• \nAbout half had mission statements,\
      \ organizational certification and licensure, service coordination, \nand financial\
      \ incentives focused on treating either mental illness or SUDs but not both.\
      \ \n• \n24 of 30 programs could only bill for mental health services or SUD\
      \ treatment but not both. \n• \n18 programs routinely used clinical interview\
      \ assessment techniques adapted to CODs, but only 6 of \nthose programs had\
      \ formal standardized screening tools for CODs. Only 5 programs had formal \n\
      procedures in place to conduct comprehensive assessments of clients who screen\
      \ positive for CODs. \n• \nMost programs lacked stagewise treatments specifically\
      \ for CODs, including a lack of \npsychoeducation about and recovery support\
      \ for both mental disorders and SUDs. \n• \n18 programs had onsite prescribers."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 8—Workforce\
      \ and Administrative Concerns in Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \ \n \nPage 240 \n• \n23 programs used supervision and consultation to address\
      \ mental conditions and substance use. \nHowever, most programs did not have\
      \ licensed or otherwise competently trained staff to provide \nCOD services\
      \ other than pharmacotherapy management. \n• \nOver 80 percent of the sites\
      \ offered direct staff training in basic competencies (e.g., prevalence, \n\
      signs and symptoms, assessment procedures), but only about 57 percent of programs\
      \ had staff with \nat least some advanced competency training in treating CODs.\
      \ \nThe consensus panel underscores the importance of an investment in creating\
      \ a supportive environment \nfor staff that encourages professional development\
      \ to include skill acquisition, values clarification, \ntraining, and competency\
      \ attainment equal to an investment in new COD program development. An \norganizational\
      \ commitment to both is necessary for successful implementation of programs.\
      \ Examples \nof staff support may include standards of practice related to consistent\
      \ high-quality supervision, \nfavorable tuition reimbursement and release time\
      \ policies, helpful personnel policies related to \nbolstering staff wellness\
      \ practices, and incentives or rewards for work-related achievement, etc. \n\
      Together these elements help in the creation of needed infrastructure for quality\
      \ of service. \nIn support of all behavioral health service providers embodying\
      \ “no wrong door” policy for service \nreadiness, the consensus panel strongly\
      \ suggests all administrators consider providing COD training as \npart of their\
      \ workforce development for staff, even if their program is not a specialty\
      \ COD program. \nAttitudes and Values \nAttitudes and values guide the way providers\
      \ meet client needs and affect the overall treatment climate. \nThey not only\
      \ determine how the client is viewed by the provider (thereby generating assumptions\
      \ that \ncould either facilitate or deter achievement of the highest standard\
      \ of care), but also profoundly \ninfluence how the client feels as he or she\
      \ experiences a program. Attitudes and values are particularly \nimportant in\
      \ working with clients who have CODs because the counselor is confronted with\
      \ two \ndisorders that require complex interventions. \nAttitudes and values\
      \ are important targets of professional development and traineeship. Some research\
      \ \nindicates that behavioral health service providers and trainees have more\
      \ negative attitudes toward \npeople with SMI and with SUDs–either separately\
      \ or in combination–than they do toward people with \nmedical or other mental\
      \ disorders, and that attitudes toward individuals with comorbid SUDs and \n\
      psychotic disorders in particular are among the most negative and worsen over\
      \ time (Avery et al., 2016; \nAvery et al., 2017; Avery & Zerbo, 2015; Mundon,\
      \ Anderson, & Najavits, 2015). Education-focused \ntraining and increased exposure\
      \ to SMI, SUD, and COD populations could potentially help increase \nprovider\
      \ comfort, competency, and confidence while diluting personal biases that directly\
      \ affect clinical \ncare. \nThe essential attitudes and values for working with\
      \ clients who have CODs shown in Exhibit 8.3 are \nadapted from Technical Assistance\
      \ Publication 21, Addiction Counseling Competencies: The Knowledge, \nSkills,\
      \ and Attitudes of Professional Practice (CSAT, 2006a). The consensus panel\
      \ believes these attitudes \nand values also are consistent with the attitudes\
      \ and values of the vast majority of those who commit \nthemselves to the challenging\
      \ fields of SUD treatment and mental health services. \n \n \nExhibit 8.3. Essential\

      \ \n \nPage 241 \nHow to Improve Providers’ Attitudes Toward Clients With CODs\
      \ \nSeveral strategies can help reduce stigma and negative attitudes and opinions\
      \ among behavioral health \nservice providers about people with CODs. These\
      \ include (Avery et al., 2016): \n• \nIncreasing didactic and clinical exposure\
      \ to clients with these disorders to improve provider \nknowledge and experience.\
      \ \n• \nProviding education about commonly held negative attitudes and misperceptions\
      \ about CODs, and \nencouraging trainees to reflect on and discuss their own\
      \ experiences and beliefs (e.g., via journaling, \nwriting reflection papers).\
      \ \n• \nOffering supervision and mentorship by senior providers trained in addiction\
      \ medicine. \nProvider Competencies \nProvider competencies are the specific\
      \ and measurable skills provider must possess. Several States, \nuniversity\
      \ programs, and expert committees have defined the key competencies for working\
      \ with clients \nwho have CODs. Typically, these competencies are developed\
      \ by training mental health and SUD \ntreatment counselors together, often using\
      \ a case-based approach that allows trainees to experience \nthe insights each\
      \ field affords the other. \nOne challenge of training is to include culturally\
      \ sensitive methods and materials that reflect \nconsideration for the varying\
      \ levels of expertise and background of participants. The consensus panel \n\
      recommends viewing competencies as basic, intermediate, and advanced to foster\
      \ continuing \nprofessional development of all counselors and clinicians in\
      \ the field of CODs. Clearly, the sample \ncompetencies listed within each category\
      \ cannot be completely separated from each other (e.g., \ncompetencies in the\
      \ “basic” category may require some competency in the “intermediate” category).\
      \ \nSome of the categorizations may be debatable, but the grouping within each\
      \ category reflects, on the \nwhole, different levels of provider competency.\
      \ \nProviders in the field face unusual challenges and often provide effective\
      \ treatment while working \nwithin their established frameworks. In fact, research\
      \ studies previously cited have established the \neffectiveness of SUD treatment\
      \ approaches in working with people who have low-to moderate-severity \nmental\
      \ disorders. Still, the classification of competencies supports continued professional\
      \ development \nand promotes training opportunities. \n• Desire and willingness\
      \ to work with people who have CODs Desire and willingness to work with people\
      \ who \nhave CODs  \n• Appreciation of the complexity of CODs  \n• Openness\
      \ to new information  \n• Awareness of personal reactions and feelings  \n•\
      \ Recognition of the limitations of one’s own personal knowledge and expertise\
      \  \n• Recognition of the value of client input into treatment goals and receptivity\
      \ to client feedback  \n• Patience, perseverance, and therapeutic optimism \
      \ \n• Ability to use diverse theories, concepts, models, and methods  \n• Flexibility\
      \ of approach  \n• Cultural competence  \n• Belief that all people have strengths\
      \ and are capable of growth and development (added by consensus panel)  \n•\
      \ Recognition of the rights of clients with CODs, including the right and need\
      \ to understand assessment results \nand the treatment plan"

      occurring.aspx) that includes checklists for ensuring behavioral health service\
      \ providers working with clients \nwho have CODs meet basic, intermediate, and\
      \ advanced competencies: \n• Basic Competencies \n(www.oregon.gov/oha/HSD/AMH/CoOccurring%20Resources/Basic%20Compentencies%20Checklist.pdf)\

      \ \nBasic Competencies \nEvery SUD treatment and mental health service program\
      \ should require counselors to have certain \nbasic skills. Basic COD competencies\
      \ include having a perfunctory understanding and working \nknowledge of the\
      \ prevalence of CODs, screening and assessment procedures, common signs and\
      \ \nsymptoms, how to triage clients appropriately (e.g., referring for specialty\
      \ care, engaging in treatment), \nhow to provide brief interventions, and how\
      \ to engage clients in treatment decision making (SAMHSA, \n2011b). In keeping\
      \ with the principle that there is “no wrong door,” the consensus panel recommends\
      \ \nthat clinicians working in SUD treatment settings should be able to carry\
      \ out the mental-health–related \nactivities shown in Exhibit 8.4. \nExhibit\
      \ 8.4. Examples of Basic Competencies Needed To Treat People With CODs  \n•\
      \ Perform a basic screening to determine whether CODs might exist and be able\
      \ to refer the client for a formal \ndiagnostic assessment by someone trained\
      \ to do this. \n• Form a preliminary impression of the nature of the disorder\
      \ a client may have, which can be verified by \nsomeone formally trained and\
      \ licensed in mental disorder diagnosis.  \n• Conduct a preliminary screening\
      \ of whether a client poses an immediate danger to self or others and \ncoordinate\
      \ any subsequent assessment with appropriate staff and consultants.  \n• Be\
      \ able to engage the client in such a way as to enhance and facilitate future\
      \ interaction.  \n• De-escalate the emotional state of a client who is agitated,\
      \ anxious, angry, or in another vulnerable \nemotional state.  \n• Manage a\
      \ crisis involving a client with CODs, including a threat of suicide or harm\
      \ to others. This may involve \nseeking out assistance by others trained to\
      \ handle certain aspects of such crises; for example, processing \ncommitment\
      \ papers and related matters.  \n• Refer a client to the appropriate mental\
      \ health service or SUD treatment facility and follow up to ensure the \nclient\
      \ receives needed care.  \n• Coordinate care with a mental health counselor\
      \ serving the same client to ensure that the interaction of the \nclient’s disorders\
      \ is well understood and that treatment plans are coordinated."

      \ mental \nhealth system linkage, supporting medication, running basic mental\

      recommends the intermediate level competencies shown in Exhibit 8.5, developed\
      \ jointly by the New \nYork State Office of Mental Health and the New York State\
      \ Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse \nServices. \nExhibit 8.5. Six Intermediate\
      \ Competencies for Treating People With CODs \n• Competency I: Integrated Diagnosis\
      \ of Substance Abuse and Mental Disorders. Differential diagnosis, \nterminology\
      \ (definitions), pharmacology, laboratory tests and physical examination, withdrawal\
      \ symptoms, \ncultural factors, effects of trauma on symptoms, staff self-awareness\
      \  \n• Competency II: Integrated Assessment of Treatment Needs. Severity assessment,\
      \ lethality/risk, assessment \nof motivation/readiness for treatment, appropriateness/treatment\
      \ selection  \n• Competency III: Integrated Treatment Planning. Goal-setting/problem\
      \ solving, treatment planning, \ndocumentation, confidentiality, legal/reporting\
      \ standards, documenting clinical concerns for managed care \nproviders  \n\
      • Competency IV: Engagement and Education. Staff self-awareness, engagement,\
      \ motivating, educating  \n• Competency V: Early Integrated Treatment Methods.\
      \ Emergency/crisis intervention, knowledge and access \nto treatment services,\
      \ when and how to refer or communicate  \n• Competency VI: Longer Term Integrated\
      \ Treatment Methods. Group treatment, relapse prevention, case \nmanagement,\
      \ pharmacotherapy, alternatives/risk education, ethics, confidentiality,3 mental\
      \ health, \nreporting requirements, family interventions  \nAdvanced Competencies\
      \  \nAt the advanced level, the practitioner goes beyond an awareness of the\
      \ addiction and mental health \nfields as individual disciplines to a more sophisticated\
      \ appreciation for how CODs interact. This \nenhanced awareness leads to an\
      \ improved ability to provide appropriate integrated treatment. At a \nminimum,\
      \ advanced competencies in CODs should include possessing an indepth knowledge\
      \ of specific \ntherapies and treatment interventions, assessment and diagnosis\
      \ procedures, and basic knowledge of \npharmacotherapies (SAMHSA, 2011b). Exhibit\
      \ 8.6 gives examples of advanced skills.  \nExhibit 8.6. Examples of Advanced\
      \ Competencies for Treatment of People With CODs \n• Understand the transtheoretical\
      \ model and how client motivation and readiness to change affect behavior. \n\
      • Learn to enhance motivation via motivational interviewing and motivational\
      \ enhancement therapy skills. \n• Be aware of the relapse prevention model and\
      \ integrating relapse prevention skills into treatments. \n• Use criteria from\
      \ Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (American\
      \ Psychiatric \nAssociation [APA], 2013) to assess substance-related and other\
      \ mental disorders. \n• Understand the effects of level of functioning and degree\
      \ of disability related to both substance-related and \nmental disorders, separately\
      \ and combined. \n \n3 Confidentiality is governed by the federal “Confidentiality\
      \ of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records” regulations \n(42 C.F.R. Part 2)\
      \ and the federal “Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health\
      \ Information” (45 C.F.R. \nParts 160 and 164)."

      \ \n \nPage 244 \n• Apply knowledge of psychotropic medications, their actions,\
      \ medical risks, side effects, and possible \ninteractions with other substances.\
      \ \n• Use integrated models of assessment, intervention, and recovery for people\
      \ having both substance-related \nand mental disorders, as opposed to sequential\
      \ treatment efforts that resist integration. \n• Collaboratively develop and\
      \ implement an integrated treatment plan based on thorough assessment that \n\
      addresses both/all disorders and establishes sequenced goals based on urgent\
      \ needs, considering the stage \nof recovery, stage of change, and level of\
      \ engagement. \n• Involve the person, family members, and other supports and\
      \ service providers (including peer supports and \nthose in the natural support\
      \ system) in establishing, monitoring, and refining the current treatment plan.\
      \ \n• Help clients expand their social networks and systems of support. \nSupervision\
      \ \nRelational skills are requisite for staff working in COD programs (Petrakis\
      \ et al., 2018), skills that are best \nlearned through clinical supervision.\
      \ A lack of high-quality supervision can hinder the ability of individual \n\
      providers and programs as a whole to provide effective, evidence-based treatments\
      \ for clients with COD \n(Petrakis et al., 2018; Sacks et al., 2013). To feel\
      \ capable and confident in delivering appropriate \ntreatments, providers need\
      \ regular, ongoing, structured supervision that not only addresses specific\
      \ \naspects of individual caseloads but broad didactics about COD populations\
      \ as a whole. Active listening, \ninterviewing techniques, the ability to summarize,\
      \ and the capacity to provide feedback are all skills that \ncan be best modeled\
      \ by a supervisor. Strong, active supervision of ongoing cases is a key element\
      \ in \nassisting staff to develop, maintain, and enhance relational skills.\
      \ (See also “Resource Alert: \nCompetencies and Training for SUD treatment Supervisors.”)\
      \ Leadership efforts among supervisors, \nadministrators, management, and senior\
      \ staff help improve the uptake and provision of evidence-\nbased COD services\
      \ by providers and COD processes by organizations, leading to better outcomes\
      \ for \nclients. Such efforts include actively championing and encouraging COD-specific\
      \ clinical training and \nsupervision practices and securing resources to support\
      \ integrated care (Guerrero, Padwa, Lengnick-\nHall, Kong, & Perrigo, 2015).\
      \ \nTo achieve COD capability, SAMHSA (2011b) recommends that programs ideally\
      \ offer supervision that: \n• \nIs provided by professionals with licensure/certification\
      \ in the addiction field, such as \nlicensed/certified addiction counselors,\
      \ clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical social workers, \npsychological\
      \ counselors, marriage and family therapists, and specialty practice nurse practitioners\
      \ \n(psychiatric and mental health nurses).  \n• \nIs provided formally and\
      \ routinely, preferably onsite. Otherwise, supervision should at least be \n\
      available as needed and offered on a semistructured basis. \n• \nIncludes a\
      \ focus on assessment and treatment skill development and, at the very least,\
      \ should cover \ntopics of case disposition and crisis management.  \n• \nIs\
      \ performed individually, in groups, or both. \n• \nUses multiple methods of\
      \ oversight, such as reviewing provider–supervisor rating forms, reviewing \n\
      audio/video recordings of client sessions, direct observation, or a combination\
      \ thereof.  \n \nResource Alert: Competencies and Training for SUD Treatment\

      \ Strategies \n(http://toolkit.ahpnet.com/Supervision-Intervention-Strategies.aspx)\
      \ \nContinuing Professional Development \nThe consensus panel is aware that\
      \ many providers in the SUD treatment and mental health services \nfields have\
      \ performed effectively the difficult task of providing services for clients\
      \ with CODs, until \nrecently without much guidance from an existing body of\
      \ knowledge or available systematic \napproaches. The landscape has changed,\
      \ and a solid knowledge base is now available to the counselor. \nHowever, that\
      \ knowledge typically is scattered through many journals and reports. This TIP\
      \ makes an \neffort to integrate the available information. Counselors reading\
      \ this TIP can review their own \nknowledge and determine what they need to\
      \ continue their professional development. \nCounselors should check with their\
      \ states’ certification bodies to determine whether training leading to \nformal\
      \ credentials in counseling people with CODs is available (also see the Section\
      \ “COD/Addiction \nCertification in Health Disciplines” for links to websites\
      \ that offer such information). Appendix B also lists \nsome resources counselors\
      \ can use to enhance their professional knowledge and development. \nEducation\
      \ and Training \nAlthough many COD programming staff do possess basic skills,\
      \ advanced provider skills and specialized \ntraining in CODs are frequently\
      \ lacking (Padwa et al., 2013; Petrakis et al., 2018; Sacks et al., 2013). \n\
      Training (along with supervision) in mental health service and SUD treatment\
      \ can be effective in \nimproving providers’ competence and treatment fidelity,\
      \ which in turn have been associated with \nreductions in the severity of clients’\
      \ mental illness symptom and substance use (Meier et al., 2015). \nInadequate\
      \ staff training is a barrier to people with CODs receiving needed treatment\
      \ (Padwa et al., \n2015). Rather than focusing on staff performance, like managing\
      \ large caseloads and increasing billable \nhours, providers may benefit more\
      \ from COD-specific training to enhance their didactic knowledge of \nand comfort\
      \ treating clients who have co-occurring SUDs (Padwa et al., 2015).  \nStaff\
      \ in integrated primary care and behavioral health service settings report desiring\
      \ more education, \ntraining, and support related to SUD treatment services\
      \ (Zubkoff, Shiner, & Watts, 2016), including:  \n• \nHiring more staff, especially\
      \ professionals with previous knowledge and experience in SUDs. \n• \nAdditional\
      \ tangible resources (e.g., more therapy rooms). \n• \nMore guidance in providing\
      \ brief addiction interventions, such as motivational interviewing. \n• \nTraining\
      \ on how to address clients with complex substance-related needs. \n• \nEducation\
      \ about the availability of different SUD treatment options. \n• \nQuick and\
      \ easy access to as-needed consultations (e.g., phone-based consultations with\
      \ peers with \nexperience in treating SUDs). \nThe scope of practice that addiction\
      \ counselors must follow legally and under which they can be reimbursed \nvary\
      \ from state to state (University of Michigan Behavioral Health Workforce Research\
      \ Center, 2018). In some \nstates, practice privileges are broad, and in others\
      \ they are quite restrictive. For instance, certain states \nmandate that addiction\
      \ counselors can only conduct assessments and provide treatments for SUDs, limiting\
      \ \ntheir ability to serve clients with CODs. Certification requirements and\
      \ authorized services also are inconsistent."

      \ for People With Co-Occurring Disorders \nMARCH 2020 \nChapter 8—Workforce\
      \ and Administrative Concerns in Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \ \n \nPage 246 \nThe lack of standardized training, credentialing, and practices\
      \ makes it difficult for the behavioral health field as \na whole to effectively\
      \ respond to gaps in COD treatment access and provision. \nDiscipline-Specific\
      \ Education \nStaff education and training are fundamental to all SUD treatment\
      \ programs. Although there have been \nimprovements in the past decade, there\
      \ are still very few university-based programs that offer a formal \ncurriculum\
      \ on CODs. Many professional organizations are promoting the development of\
      \ competencies \nand practice standards for intervening with substance use problems,\
      \ including the APA, American \nPsychological Association; the American Society\
      \ of Addiction Medicine (ASAM); the National Association \nof Social Workers\
      \ (NASW); and the American Counseling Association. They are also specifically\
      \ \nencouraging faculty members to enhance their knowledge in this area so they\
      \ can better prepare their \nstudents to meet the needs of clients with CODs.\
      \ The consensus panel encourages all such organizations \nto identify standards\
      \ and competencies for their membership related to CODs and to encourage the\
      \ \ndevelopment of training for specific disciplines. \nBecause the consequences\
      \ of both addiction and mental disorders can present with physical or \npsychiatric\
      \ manifestations, it is equally important for medical students, internal medicine\
      \ and general \npractice residents, and general psychiatry residents to be educated\
      \ in the problems of CODs. Too few \nhours of medical education are devoted\
      \ to the problems of addiction and mental disorders. Medication \ncan play a\
      \ critical role in the treatment of CODs, so it is important to have adequately\
      \ trained physicians \nwho can manage medication therapies for clients with\
      \ CODs. \nMeeting the Growing Demand for Addiction Counselors in the Future:\
      \ Faring Well or Falling Short? \nHRSA (2018) projects the number of addiction\
      \ counselors will increase by 6 percent from 2016 to 2030. \nHowever, during\
      \ that same time period, they calculate a 21 percent increase in the demand\
      \ for addiction \ncounselors, leaving a deficit of 13,600 full-time addiction\
      \ counselor positions in the labor force. When \ncalculating the supply and\
      \ demand while also accounting for the millions of Americans who will have unmet\
      \ \nbehavioral health service needs, demand will exceed supply by 38 percent.\
      \ Under this scenario, there would be \na deficit of nearly 35,000 addiction\
      \ counselors. \nContinuing Education and Training  \nMany SUD treatment counselors\
      \ learn through continuing education and facility-sponsored training. \nContinuing\
      \ education and training involves participation in a variety of courses and\
      \ workshops from \nbasic to advanced level offered by a number of training entities.\
      \ The strength of continuing education \nand training courses and workshops\
      \ is that they provide the counselor with the opportunity to review \nand process\
      \ written material with a qualified instructor and other practitioners. \nContinuing\
      \ education is useful because it can respond rapidly to the needs of a workforce\
      \ that has \ndiverse educational backgrounds and experience. To have practical\
      \ utility, competency training must \naddress the day-to-day concerns that counselors\
      \ face in working with clients who have CODs. The \neducational context must\
      \ be rich with information, culturally sensitive, designed for adult students,\
      \ and \nmust include examples and role models. It is optimal if the instructors\
      \ have extensive experience as \npractitioners in the field.  \nContinuing education\
      \ is essential for effective provision of services to people with CODs, but\
      \ it is not \nsufficient in and of itself. Counselors must have ongoing support,\
      \ supervision, and opportunity to \npractice new skills if they are to truly\
      \ integrate COD content into their practice."

      \ and Administrative Concerns in Working With People Who Have Co-Occurring Disorders\
      \ \n \nPage 247 \n \nRecent survey data (SAMHSA, 2018e) involving approximately\
      \ 13,600 SUD treatment facilities nationwide about \ntheir quality assurance\
      \ practices and found almost 98 percent included continuing education among\
      \ their \nstandard operating procedures. Nearly all facilities (almost 94 percent)\
      \ regularly conducted case reviews \nbetween providers and supervisors. About\
      \ 92 percent conducted client satisfaction surveys. \nCross-Training \nCross-training\
      \ is the simultaneous provision of material and training to more than one discipline\
      \ at a \ntime (e.g., addiction and social work counselors; addiction counselors\
      \ and corrections officers). \nCounselors who have primary expertise in either\
      \ addiction or mental health will be able to work far \nmore effectively with\
      \ clients who have CODs if they have some degree of cross-training in the other\
      \ \nfield. The consensus panel recommends that counselors of either field receive\
      \ at least basic level cross-\ntraining in the other field to better assess,\
      \ refer, understand, and work effectively with the large number \nof clients\
      \ with CODs. Cross-trained individuals who know their primary field of training\
      \ well, and also \nhave an appreciation for the other field, provide a richness\
      \ of capacity that cannot be attained using any \ncombination of personnel familiar\
      \ with one system alone. \nWhen training is offered in this manner, interaction\
      \ and communication between the counselors from \neach discipline is facilitated.\
      \ This helps to remove barriers, increase understanding, and promote \nintegrated\
      \ work. Cross-training is particularly valuable for staff members who will work\
      \ together in the \nsame program. Consensus panel members have found cross-training\
      \ very valuable in mental health \nservices, SUD treatment, and criminal justice\
      \ work. \nNational Training Resources  \nCurricula and other educational materials\
      \ are available through ATTCs, universities, state entities, and \nprivate consultants.\
      \ These materials can help enhance the ability of SUD treatment counselors to\
      \ work \nwith clients who have mental disorders, as well as to enable mental\
      \ health personnel to improve their \nefforts with people who have SUDs. ATTCs\
      \ offer workshops, courses, and online remote location \ncourses. (See Appendix\
      \ B for training sources.) \nCOD/Addiction Certification in Health Disciplines\
      \ \nThe disciplines of medicine and psychology have recognized subspecialties\
      \ in CODs with a defined \nprocess for achieving a certificate in this area.\
      \ Exhibit 8.7 summarizes current information on \ncertification by discipline.\
      \ Drug and alcohol certification requirements vary by state (review at \nhttps://addictionstraininginstitute.com/certifications-in-florida/)\
      \ as do addiction counselor \nrequirements (www.addiction-counselors.com/).\

      \ development is difficult. The panel urges agency and program administrators,\
      \ including \nline-level and clinical supervisors, to develop COD competencies\
      \ themselves and to support and \nencourage continuing workforce education and\
      \ training. To the extent possible, they should customize \neducation and training\
      \ efforts—in content, schedule, and location—to meet the needs of counselors\
      \ in \nthe field. That is, bring the training to the counselor. Rewards can\
      \ include salary and advancement tied \nto counselors’ efforts to increase effectiveness\
      \ in serving clients with CODs, shown via job performance. \nClinicians in primary\
      \ care settings, community mental health centers, or private mental health offices\

      \ Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the U.S.\
      \ Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS). Each TIP involves the development\
      \ of topic-specific best practice guidelines for \nthe prevention and treatment\
      \ of substance use and mental disorders. TIPs draw on the experience \nand knowledge\
      \ of clinical, research, and administrative experts of various forms of treatment\
      \ and\nprevention. TIPs are distributed to facilities and individuals across\
      \ the country. Published TIPs \ncan be accessed via the Internet at http://store.samhsa.gov.\
      \ \nAlthough each consensus-based TIP strives to include an evidence base for\
      \ the practices it rec­\nommends, SAMHSA recognizes that behavioral health is\
      \ continually evolving, and research fre­\nquently lags behind the innovations\
      \ pioneered in the field. A major goal of each TIP is to convey \n“front-line”\
      \ information quickly but responsibly. If research supports a particular approach,\
      \ cita­\ntions are provided. \nxi"

      Foreword  \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\
      \ is the agency \nwithin the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that\
      \ leads public health efforts to\nadvance the behavioral health of the nation.\
      \ SAMHSA’s mission is to reduce the impact of sub­\nstance abuse and mental\
      \ illness on America’s communities. \nThe Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP)\
      \ series fulfills SAMHSA’s mission to improve pre­\nvention and treatment of\
      \ substance use and mental disorders by providing best practices guidance \n\
      to clinicians, program administrators, and payers.TIPs are the result of careful\
      \ consideration of\nall relevant clinical and health services research findings,\
      \ demonstration experience, and imple­\nmentation requirements. A panel of non-Federal\
      \ clinical researchers, clinicians, program admin­\nistrators, and patient advocates\
      \ debates and discusses their particular area of expertise until they \nreach\
      \ a consensus on best practices. This panel’s work is then reviewed and critiqued\
      \ by field \nreviewers. \nThe talent, dedication, and hard work that TIP panelists\
      \ and reviewers bring to this highly par­\nticipatory process have helped bridge\
      \ the gap between the promise of research and the needs of\npracticing clinicians\
      \ and administrators to serve, in the most scientifically sound and effective\n\
      ways, people in need of behavioral health services. We are grateful to all who\
      \ have joined with us \nto contribute to advances in the behavioral health field.\

      \n[Page 17]\nHow This TIP Is Organized \nThis Treatment Improvement Protocol\
      \ (TIP) is divided into three parts:\n•\nPart 1: A Practical Guide for the Provision\
      \ of Behavioral Health Services \n•\nPart 2: An Implementation Guide for Behavioral\
      \ Health Program Administrators \n•\nPart 3: A Review of the Literature \nPart\
      \ 1 is for behavioral health service providers and consists of six chapters.\
      \ Recurring themes \ninclude the variety of ways that substance abuse, mental\
      \ health, and trauma interact; the im­\nportance of context and culture in a\
      \ person’s response to trauma; trauma-informed screening and\nassessment tools,\
      \ techniques, strategies, and approaches that help behavioral health professionals\
      \ \nassist clients in recovery from mental and substance use disorders who have\
      \ also been affected by \nacute or chronic traumas; and the significance of\
      \ adhering to a strengths-based perspective that \nacknowledges the resilience\
      \ within individual clients, providers, and communities. \nChapter 1 lays the\
      \ groundwork and rationale for the implementation and provision of trauma-\n\
      informed services. It provides an overview of specific trauma-informed intervention\
      \ and treat­\nment principles that guide clinicians, other behavioral health\
      \ workers, and administrators in\nbecoming trauma informed and in creating a\
      \ trauma-informed organization and workforce.\nChapter 2 provides an overview\
      \ of traumatic experiences. It covers types of trauma; distinguishes \namong\
      \ traumas that affect individuals, groups, and communities; describes trauma\
      \ characteristics;\nand addresses the socioecological and cultural factors that\
      \ influence the impact of trauma. Chap­\nter 3 broadly focuses on understanding\
      \ the impact of trauma, trauma-related stress reactions and\nassociated symptoms,\
      \ and common mental health and substance use disorders associated with\ntrauma.\
      \ Chapter 4 provides an introduction to screening and assessment as they relate\
      \ to trauma\nand is devoted to screening and assessment processes and tools\
      \ that are useful in evaluating\ntrauma exposure, its effects, and client intervention\
      \ and treatment needs. Chapter 5 covers clini­\ncal issues that counselors and\
      \ other behavioral health professionals may need to know and ad­\ndress when\
      \ treating clients who have histories of trauma. Chapter 6 presents information\
      \ on\nspecific treatment models for trauma, distinguishing integrated models\
      \ (which address substance\nuse disorders, mental disorders, and trauma simultaneously)\
      \ from those that treat trauma alone. \nAdvice to Counselors and/or Administrators\
      \ boxes in Part 1 provide practical information for\nproviders. Case illustrations,\
      \ exhibits, and text boxes further illustrate information in the text by \n\
      offering practical examples. \nPart 2 provides an overview of programmatic and\
      \ administrative practices that will help behav­\nioral health program administrators\
      \ increase the capacity of their organizations to deliver \nxv"

      \ challenges, and processes \nin creating and implementing trauma-informed services\
      \ within an organization. Chapter 2\nfocuses on key development activities that\
      \ support staff members, including trauma-informed \ntraining and supervision,\
      \ ethics, and boundaries pertinent to responding to traumatic stress,\nsecondary\
      \ trauma, and counselor self-care. \nAdvice to Administrators and/or Supervisors\
      \ boxes in Part 2 highlight more detailed information\nthat supports the organizational\
      \ implementation of trauma-informed care (TIC). In addition,\ncase illustrations,\
      \ organizational activities, and text boxes reinforce the material presented\
      \ within\nthis section. \nPart 3 is a literature review on TIC and behavioral\
      \ health services and is intended for use by clin­\nical supervisors, interested\
      \ providers, and administrators. Part 3 has three sections: an analysis of\n\
      the literature, links to select abstracts of the references most central to\
      \ the topic, and a general \nbibliography of the available literature. To facilitate\
      \ ongoing updates (performed periodically for\nup to 3 years from first publication),\
      \ the literature review is only available online at the Substance \nAbuse and\
      \ Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Publications Ordering Web\n\
      page (http://store.samhsa.gov). \nTerminology \nBehavioral health: Throughout\
      \ the TIP, the term “behavioral health” is used. Behavioral health\nrefers to\
      \ a state of mental/emotional being and/or choices and actions that affect wellness.\
      \ Be­\nhavioral health problems include substance abuse or misuse, alcohol and\
      \ drug addiction, serious \npsychological distress, suicide, and mental and\
      \ substance use disorders. This includes a range of\nproblems from unhealthy\
      \ stress to diagnosable and treatable diseases like serious mental illness \n\
      and substance use disorders, which are often chronic in nature but from which\
      \ people can and do\nrecover. The term is also used in this TIP to describe\
      \ the service systems encompassing the pro­\nmotion of emotional health, the\
      \ prevention of mental and substance use disorders, substance use \nand related\
      \ problems, treatments and services for mental and substance use disorders,\
      \ and recov­\nery support. Because behavioral health conditions, taken together,\
      \ are the leading causes of disa­\nbility burden in North America, efforts to\
      \ improve their prevention and treatment will benefit\nsociety as a whole. Efforts\
      \ to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders on Ameri­\nca’s\
      \ communities, such as those described in this TIP, will help achieve nationwide\
      \ improvements \nin health. \nClient/consumer: In this TIP, the term “client”\
      \ means anyone who seeks or receives mental \nhealth or substance abuse services.\
      \ The term “consumer” stands in place of “client” in content\nareas that address\
      \ consumer participation and determination. It is not the intent of this docu­\n\
      ment to ignore the relevance and historical origin of the term “consumer” among\
      \ individuals who\nhave received, been subject to, or are seeking mental health\
      \ services. Instead, we choose the word\n“client,” given that this terminology\
      \ is also commonly used in substance abuse treatment services.\nNote: This TIP\
      \ also uses the term “participant(s)” instead of “client(s)” for individuals,\
      \ families, or\ncommunities seeking or receiving prevention services. \nComplex\
      \ trauma: This manual adopts the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN)\
      \ \ndefinition of complex trauma. The term refers to the pervasive impact, including\
      \ developmental \nxvi"

      \ exposure to multiple or prolonged traumatic events. According to the NCTSN\n\
      Web site (http://www.nctsn.org/trauma-types), complex trauma typically involves\
      \ exposure to\nsequential or simultaneous occurrences of maltreatment, “including\
      \ psychological maltreatment,\nneglect, physical and sexual abuse, and domestic\
      \ violence…. Exposure to these initial traumatic\nexperiences—and the resulting\
      \ emotional dysregulation and the loss of safety, direction, and the \nability\
      \ to detect or respond to danger cues—often sets off a chain of events leading\
      \ to subsequent\nor repeated trauma exposure in adolescence and adulthood” (NCTSN,\
      \ 2013). \nCo-occurring disorders: When an individual has one or more mental\
      \ disorders as well as one or \nmore substance use disorders (including substance\
      \ abuse), the term “co-occurring” applies.\nAlthough people may have a number\
      \ of health conditions that co-occur, including physical prob­\nlems, the term\
      \ “co-occurring disorders,” in this TIP, refers to substance use and mental\
      \ disorders. \nCultural responsiveness and cultural competence: This TIP uses\
      \ these terms interchangeably,\nwith “responsiveness” applied to services and\
      \ systems and “competence” applied to people, to refer\nto “a set of behaviors,\
      \ attitudes, and policies that…enable a system, agency, or group of profes­\n\
      sionals to work effectively in cross-cultural situations” (Cross, Bazron, Dennis,\
      \ & Isaacs, 1989, p.\n13). Culturally responsive behavioral health services\
      \ and culturally competent providers “honor\nand respect the beliefs, languages,\
      \ interpersonal styles, and behaviors of individuals and families \nreceiving\
      \ services…. [C]ultural competence is a dynamic, ongoing developmental process\
      \ that \nrequires a long-term commitment and is achieved over time” (U.S. Department\
      \ of Health and\nHuman Services, 2003, p. 12). \nEvidence-based practices: There\
      \ are many different uses of the term “evidence-based practices.”\nOne of the\
      \ most widely accepted is that of Chambless and Hollon (1998), who say that\
      \ for a\ntreatment to be considered evidence based, it must show evidence of\
      \ positive outcomes based on\npeer-reviewed randomized controlled trials or\
      \ other equivalent strong methodology. A treatment\nis labeled “strong” if criteria\
      \ are met for what Chambless and Hollon term “well-established”\ntreatments.\
      \ To attain this level, rigorous treatment outcome studies conducted by independent\n\
      investigators (not just the treatment developer) are necessary. Research support\
      \ is labeled “mod­\nest” when treatments attain criteria for what Chambless\
      \ and Hollon call “probably efficacious \ntreatments.”To meet this standard,\
      \ one well-designed study or two or more adequately designed\nstudies must support\
      \ a treatment’s efficacy. In addition, it is possible to meet the “strong” and\n\
      “modest” thresholds through a series of carefully controlled single-case studies.\
      \ An evidence-\nbased practice derived from sound, science-based theories incorporates\
      \ detailed and empirically \nsupported procedures and implementation guidelines,\
      \ including parameters of applications (such\nas for populations), inclusionary\
      \ and exclusionary criteria for participation, and target\ninterventions. \n\
      Promising practices: Even though current clinical wisdom, theories, and professional\
      \ and expert\nconsensus may support certain practices, these practices may lack\
      \ support from studies that are \nscientifically rigorous in research design\
      \ and statistical analysis; available studies may be limited\nin number or sample\
      \ size, or they may not be applicable to the current setting or population.\
      \ This \nTIP refers to such practices as “promising.” \nxvii"

      \ \nRecovery: This term denotes a process of change through which individuals\
      \ improve their\nhealth and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive\
      \ to reach their full potential. Major dimen­\nsions that support a life in\
      \ recovery, as defined by SAMHSA, include:\n•\nHealth: overcoming or managing\
      \ one’s disease(s) as well as living in a physically and emo­\ntionally healthy\
      \ way. \n•\nHome: a stable and safe place to live. \n•\nPurpose: meaningful\
      \ daily activities, such as a job, school, volunteerism, family caretaking,\
      \ or\ncreative endeavors, and the independence, income, and resources to participate\
      \ in society. \n•\nCommunity: relationships and social networks that provide\
      \ support, friendship, love, and hope. \nResilience: This term refers to the\
      \ ability to bounce back or rise above adversity as an individual,\nfamily,\
      \ community, or provider. Well beyond individual characteristics of hardiness,\
      \ resilience\nincludes the process of using available resources to negotiate\
      \ hardship and/or the consequences of\nadverse events. This TIP applies the\
      \ term “resilience” and its processes to individuals across the \nlife span.\
      \ \nRetraumatization: In its more literal translation, “retraumatization” means\
      \ the occurrence of\ntraumatic stress reactions and symptoms after exposure\
      \ to multiple events (Duckworth &\nFollette, 2011). This is a significant issue\
      \ for trauma survivors, both because they are at increased\nrisk for higher\
      \ rates of retraumatization, and because people who are traumatized multiple\
      \ times \noften have more serious and chronic trauma-related symptoms than those\
      \ with single traumas. In\nthis manual, the term not only refers to the effect\
      \ of being exposed to multiple events, but also\nimplies the process of reexperiencing\
      \ traumatic stress as a result of a current situation that mir­\nrors or replicates\
      \ in some way the prior traumatic experiences (e.g., specific smells or other\
      \ senso­\nry input; interactions with others; responses to one’s surroundings\
      \ or interpersonal context, such \nas feeling emotionally or physically trapped).\
      \ \nSecondary trauma: Literature often uses the terms “secondary trauma,”“compassion\
      \ fatigue,”\nand “vicarious traumatization” interchangeably. Although compassion\
      \ fatigue and secondary \ntrauma refer to similar physical, psychological, and\
      \ cognitive changes and symptoms that behav­\nioral health workers may encounter\
      \ when they work specifically with clients who have histories \nof trauma, vicarious\
      \ trauma usually refers more explicitly to specific cognitive changes, such\
      \ as in\nworldview and sense of self (Newell & MacNeil, 2010). This publication\
      \ uses “secondary trauma”\nto describe trauma-related stress reactions and symptoms\
      \ resulting from exposure to another\nindividual’s traumatic experiences, rather\
      \ than from exposure directly to a traumatic event. Sec­\nondary trauma can\
      \ occur among behavioral health service providers across all behavioral health\n\
      settings and among all professionals who provide services to those who have\
      \ experienced trauma\n(e.g., healthcare providers, peer counselors, first responders,\
      \ clergy, intake workers). \nSubstance abuse: Throughout the TIP, the term “substance\
      \ abuse” has been used to refer to both\nsubstance abuse and substance dependence.\
      \ This term was chosen partly because behavioral \nhealth professionals commonly\
      \ use the term substance abuse to describe any excessive use of ad­\ndictive\
      \ substances. In this TIP, the term refers to the use of alcohol as well as\
      \ other substances of\nabuse. Readers should attend to the context in which\
      \ the term occurs to determine what possible \nrange of meanings it covers;\
      \ in most cases, it will refer to all varieties of substance-related \nxviii"

      \ in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition \n\
      (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a). \nTrauma: In this text, the term\
      \ “trauma” refers to experiences that cause intense physical and psy­\nchological\
      \ stress reactions. It can refer to “a single event, multiple events, or a set\
      \ of circumstances \nthat is experienced by an individual as physically and\
      \ emotionally harmful or threatening and\nthat has lasting adverse effects on\
      \ the individual’s physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well­\nbeing” (SAMHSA,\
      \ 2012, p. 2). Although many individuals report a single specific traumatic\n\
      event, others, especially those seeking mental health or substance abuse services,\
      \ have been ex­\nposed to multiple or chronic traumatic events. See the “What\
      \ Is Trauma” section in Part 1, Chap­\nter 1, for a more indepth definition\
      \ and discussion of trauma. \nTrauma-informed: A trauma-informed approach to\
      \ the delivery of behavioral health services \nincludes an understanding of\
      \ trauma and an awareness of the impact it can have across settings,\nservices,\
      \ and populations. It involves viewing trauma through an ecological and cultural\
      \ lens and\nrecognizing that context plays a significant role in how individuals\
      \ perceive and process traumatic\nevents, whether acute or chronic. In May 2012,\
      \ SAMHSA convened a group of national experts \nwho identified three key elements\
      \ of a trauma-informed approach: “(1) realizing the prevalence \nof trauma;\
      \ (2) recognizing how trauma affects all individuals involved with the program,\
      \ organi­\nzation, or system, including its own workforce; and (3) responding\
      \ by putting this knowledge into\npractice” (SAMHSA, 2012, p 4). \nTrauma-informed\
      \ care: TIC is a strengths-based service delivery approach “that is grounded\
      \ in\nan understanding of and responsiveness to the impact of trauma, that emphasizes\
      \ physical, psy­\nchological, and emotional safety for both providers and survivors,\
      \ and that creates opportunities \nfor survivors to rebuild a sense of control\
      \ and empowerment” (Hopper, Bassuk, & Olivet, 2010, p.\n82). It also involves\
      \ vigilance in anticipating and avoiding institutional processes and individual\
      \ \npractices that are likely to retraumatize individuals who already have histories\
      \ of trauma, and it\nupholds the importance of consumer participation in the\
      \ development, delivery, and evaluation of\nservices. \nTrauma-specific treatment\
      \ services: These services are evidence-based and promising practices\nthat\
      \ facilitate recovery from trauma. The term “trauma-specific services” refers\
      \ to prevention,\nintervention, or treatment services that address traumatic\
      \ stress as well as any co-occurring disor­\nders (including substance use and\
      \ mental disorders) that developed during or after trauma. \nTrauma survivor:\
      \ This phrase can refer to anyone who has experienced trauma or has had a\n\
      traumatic stress reaction. Knowing that the use of language and words can set\
      \ the tone for recov­\nery or contribute to further retraumatization, it is\
      \ the intent of this manual to put forth a message \nof hope by avoiding the\
      \ term “victim” and instead using the term “survivor” when appropriate. \nxix\n\

      1 A Sociocultural  \nPerspective  \nMany individuals who seek treatment in behavioral\
      \ health settings \nhave histories of trauma, but they often don’t recognize\
      \ the signifi­\ncant effects of trauma in their lives; either they don’t draw\
      \ connec­\ntions between their trauma histories and their presenting problems,\n\
      or they avoid the topic altogether. Likewise, treatment providers \nmay not\
      \ ask questions that elicit a client’s history of trauma, may \nfeel unprepared\
      \ to address trauma-related issues proactively, or may \nstruggle to address\
      \ traumatic stress effectively within the con­\nstraints of their treatment\
      \ program, the program’s clinical orienta­\ntion, or their agency’s directives.\
      \ \nBy recognizing that traumatic experiences and their sequelae tie \nclosely\
      \ into behavioral health problems, front-line professionals \nand community-based\
      \ programs can begin to build a trauma-\ninformed environment across the continuum\
      \ of care. Key steps \ninclude meeting client needs in a safe, collaborative,\
      \ and compas­\nsionate manner; preventing treatment practices that retraumatize\
      \ \npeople with histories of trauma who are seeking help or receiving\nservices;\
      \ building on the strengths and resilience of clients in the \ncontext of their\
      \ environments and communities; and endorsing\ntrauma-informed principles in\
      \ agencies through support, consulta­\ntion, and supervision of staff. \nThis\
      \ Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) begins by introducing\nthe scope, purpose,\
      \ and organization of the topic and describing its\nintended audience. Along\
      \ with defining trauma and trauma-\ninformed care (TIC), the first chapter discusses\
      \ the rationale for\naddressing trauma in behavioral health services and reviews\
      \ trauma-\ninformed intervention and treatment principles.These principles \n\
      serve as the TIP’s conceptual framework. \n3"

      \ \nScope of the TIP \nMany individuals experience trauma during\ntheir lifetimes.\
      \ Although many people exposed\nto trauma demonstrate few or no lingering\n\
      symptoms, those individuals who have experi­\nenced repeated, chronic, or multiple\
      \ traumas \nare more likely to exhibit pronounced symp­\ntoms and consequences,\
      \ including substance \nabuse, mental illness, and health problems.\nSubsequently,\
      \ trauma can significantly affect\nhow an individual engages in major life areas\
      \ \nas well as treatment. \nThis TIP provides evidence-based and best\npractice\
      \ information for behavioral health\nservice providers and administrators who\
      \ want\nto work more effectively with people who have \nbeen exposed to acute\
      \ and chronic traumas \nand/or are at risk of developing traumatic\nstress reactions.\
      \ Using key trauma-informed\nprinciples, this TIP addresses trauma-related\n\
      prevention, intervention, and treatment issues \nand strategies in behavioral\
      \ health services.\nThe content is adaptable across behavioral \nhealth settings\
      \ that service individuals, fami­\nlies, and communities—placing emphasis on\n\
      the importance of coordinating as well as inte­\ngrating services. \nIntended\
      \ Audience \nThis TIP is for behavioral health service pro­\nviders, prevention\
      \ specialists, and program \nadministrators—the professionals directly re­\n\
      sponsible for providing care to trauma survi­\nvors across behavioral health\
      \ settings,\nincluding substance abuse and mental health\nservices. This TIP\
      \ also targets primary care\nprofessionals, including physicians; teams \nworking\
      \ with clients and communities who\nhave experienced trauma; service providers\
      \ in\nthe criminal justice system; and researchers \nwith an interest in this\
      \ topic. \nBefore You Begin \nThis TIP endorses a trauma-informed model \nof\
      \ care; this model emphasizes the need for\nbehavioral health practitioners\
      \ and organiza­\ntions to recognize the prevalence and pervasive \nimpact of\
      \ trauma on the lives of the people \nthey serve and develop trauma-sensitive\
      \ or\ntrauma-responsive services. This TIP provides \nkey information to help\
      \ behavioral health \npractitioners and program administrators be­\ncome trauma\
      \ aware and informed, improve \nscreening and assessment processes, and im­\n\
      plement science-informed intervention strate­\ngies across settings and modalities\
      \ in\nbehavioral health services. Whether provided \nby an agency or an individual\
      \ provider, trauma-\ninformed services may or may not include \ntrauma-specific\
      \ services or trauma specialists \n(individuals who have advanced training and\n\
      education to provide specific treatment inter­\nventions to address traumatic\
      \ stress reactions).\nNonetheless,TIC anticipates the role that \ntrauma can\
      \ play across the continuum of care—\nestablishing integrated and/or collaborative\n\
      processes to address the needs of traumatized\nindividuals and communities proactively.\
      \ \nIndividuals who have experienced trauma are \nat an elevated risk for substance\
      \ use disorders,\nincluding abuse and dependence; mental \nhealth problems (e.g.,\
      \ depression and anxiety \nsymptoms or disorders, impairment in rela­\ntional/social\
      \ and other major life areas, other\ndistressing symptoms); and physical disorders\
      \ \nand conditions, such as sleep disorders. This \nTIP focuses on specific\
      \ types of prevention\n(Institute of Medicine et al., 2009): selective \nprevention,\
      \ which targets people who are at \nrisk for developing social, psychological,\
      \ or\nother conditions as a result of trauma or who \nare at greater risk for\
      \ experiencing trauma due \nto behavioral health disorders or conditions;\n\
      and indicated prevention, which targets people\nwho display early signs of trauma-related\

      \ to trauma, youth-tailored trauma-\ninformed strategies, or trauma-specific\
      \ inter­\nventions for youth or adolescents, because the \ndevelopmental and\
      \ contextual issues of these \npopulations require specialized interventions.\n\
      Providers who work with young clients who\nhave experienced trauma should refer\
      \ to the\nresource list in Appendix B. This TIP covers\nTIC, trauma characteristics,\
      \ the impact of\ntraumatic experiences, assessment, and inter­\nventions for\
      \ persons who have had traumatic\nexperiences. Considering the vast knowledge\
      \ \nbase and specificity of individual, repeated,\nand chronic forms of trauma,\

      \ of each type of trauma\n(e.g., sexual abuse, torture, war-related trauma,\

      \ described in Leading Change: \nA Plan for SAMHSA’s Roles and Actions 2011–\
      \ \n2014 (SAMHSA, 2011b). Specific to Strate­\ngic Initiative #2, Trauma and\

      \ in this initiative by providing behav­\nioral health practitioners, supervisors,\
      \ and ad­\nministrators with an introduction to culturally \nresponsive TIC.\
      \ \nSpecifically, the TIP presents fundamental \nconcepts that behavioral health\
      \ service provid­\ners can use to: \n•  Become trauma aware and knowledgeable\
      \ \nabout the impact and consequences of\ntraumatic experiences for individuals,\
      \ fami­\nlies, and communities. \n•  Evaluate and initiate use of appropriate\n\
      trauma-related screening and assessment\ntools. \n•  Implement interventions\
      \ from a collabora­\ntive, strengths-based approach, appreciating\nthe resilience\
      \ of trauma survivors. \n•  Learn the core principles and practices that\nreflect\
      \ TIC. \n•  Anticipate the need for specific trauma-\ninformed treatment planning\
      \ strategies that\nsupport the individual’s recovery. \n•  Decrease the inadvertent\
      \ retraumatization \nthat can occur from implementing standard\norganizational\
      \ policies, procedures, and in­\nterventions with individuals, including cli­\n\
      ents and staff, who have experienced\ntrauma or are exposed to secondary trauma.\
      \ \n•  Evaluate and build a trauma-informed or­\nganization and workforce. \n\
      The consensus panelists, as well as other con­\ntributors to this TIP, have\
      \ all had experience as\nsubstance abuse and mental health counselors,\nprevention\
      \ and peer specialists, supervisors,\nclinical directors, researchers, or administrators\
      \ \nworking with individuals, families, and \n5\n\n[Page 28]\nTrauma-Informed\
      \ Care in Behavioral Health Services \ncommunities who have experienced trauma.\n\
      The material presented in this TIP uses the \nwealth of their experience in\
      \ addition to the\navailable published resources and research\nrelevant to this\
      \ topic. Throughout the consen­\nsus process, the panel members were mindful\
      \ \nof the strengths and resilience inherent in in­\ndividuals, families, and\
      \ communities affected\nby trauma and the challenges providers face in \naddressing\
      \ trauma and implementing TIC. \nStructure of the TIP \nUsing a TIC framework\
      \ (Exhibit 1.1-1), this\nTIP provides information on key aspects of\ntrauma,\
      \ including what it is; its consequences;\nscreening and assessment; effective\
      \ \nprevention, intervention, and treatment ap­\nproaches; trauma recovery;\
      \ the impact of \ntrauma on service providers; programmatic\nand administrative\

      \ \nof trauma and trauma \ninterventions. \nPart 1, Chapter 1—Trauma-Informed\
      \ Care: A Sociocultural Perspective \nWhat Is Trauma? \nAccording to SAMHSA’s\
      \ Trauma and Justice \nStrategic Initiative, “trauma results from an\nevent,\
      \ series of events, or set of circumstances \nthat is experienced by an individual\
      \ as physi­\ncally or emotionally harmful or threatening\nand that has lasting\
      \ adverse effects on the in­\ndividual’s functioning and physical, social,\n\
      emotional, or spiritual well-being” \n(SAMHSA, 2012, p. 2). Trauma can affect\n\
      people of every race, ethnicity, age, sexual ori­\nentation, gender, psychosocial\
      \ background, and\ngeographic region. A traumatic experience can\nbe a single\
      \ event, a series of events, and/or a\nchronic condition (e.g., childhood neglect,\n\
      domestic violence). Traumas can affect indi­\nviduals, families, groups, communities,\
      \ specific\ncultures, and generations. It generally over­\nwhelms an individual’s\
      \ or community’s re­\nsources to cope, and it often ignites the “fight,\nflight,\
      \ or freeze” reaction at the time of the\nevent(s). It frequently produces a\
      \ sense of fear,\nvulnerability, and helplessness. \nOften, traumatic \nevents\
      \ are unex­\npected. Individuals \nmay experience \nthe traumatic \nevent directly,\
      \ witness an event, feel threat­\nened, or hear about an event that affects\
      \ \nsomeone they know. Events may be human-\nmade, such as a mechanical error\
      \ that causes a \ndisaster, war, terrorism, sexual abuse, or vio­\nlence, or\
      \ they can be the products of nature \n(e.g., flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes).\
      \ Trauma \ncan occur at any age or developmental stage,\nand often, events that\
      \ occur outside expected\nlife stages are perceived as traumatic (e.g., a\n\
      child dying before a parent, cancer as a teen,\npersonal illness, job loss before\
      \ retirement). \nIt is not just the event itself that determines\nwhether something\
      \ is traumatic, but also the \nindividual’s experience of the event. Two peo­\n\
      ple may be exposed to the same event or series \nof events but experience and\
      \ interpret these \nevents in vastly different ways. Various \nbiopsychosocial\
      \ and cultural factors influence \nan individual’s immediate response and long­\n\
      term reactions to trauma. For most, regardless \nof the severity of the trauma,\
      \ the immediate or\nenduring effects of trauma are met with resili­\nence—the\
      \ ability to rise above the circum­\nstances or to meet the challenges with\n\
      fortitude. \nFor some people, reactions to a traumatic\nevent are temporary,\
      \ whereas others have pro­\nlonged reactions that move from acute symp­\ntoms\
      \ to more severe, prolonged, or enduring\nmental health consequences (e.g.,\
      \ posttrau­\nmatic stress and other anxiety disorders, sub­\nstance use and\
      \ mood disorders) and medical \nproblems (e.g., arthritis, headaches, chronic\n\
      pain). Others do not meet established criteria\nfor posttraumatic stress or\
      \ other mental disor­\nders but encounter significant trauma-related\nsymptoms\
      \ or culturally expressed symptoms of\ntrauma (e.g., somatization, in which\
      \ psycho­\nlogical stress is expressed through physical \nconcerns). For that\
      \ reason, even if an individu­\nal does not meet diagnostic criteria for\ntrauma-related\
      \ disorders, it is important to\nrecognize that trauma may still affect his\
      \ or \nher life in significant ways. For more infor­\nmation on traumatic events,\

      \ health risks, mental \nhealth, healthcare costs, and life expectancy. \nThe\
      \ Women, Co-Occurring Disorders and Violence Study (SAMHSA, 2007) was a large\
      \ multisite \nstudy focused on the role of interpersonal and other traumatic\
      \ stressors among women; the interre­\nlatedness of trauma, violence, and co-occurring\
      \ substance use and mental disorders; and the incorpo­\nration of trauma-informed\
      \ and trauma-specific principles, models, and services. \nTrauma-Informed Care\
      \ in Behavioral Health Services \nand substance abuse are linked. With the at­\n\
      tacks of September 11, 2001, and other acts of \nterror, the wars in Iraq and\
      \ Afghanistan, disas­\ntrous hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, and sexual \nabuse\
      \ scandals, trauma has moved to the fore­\nfront of national consciousness.\
      \ \nTrauma was once considered an abnormal \nexperience. However, the first\
      \ National\nComorbidity Study established how prevalent\ntraumas were in the\
      \ lives of the general popu­\nlation of the United States. In the study, 61\n\
      percent of men and 51 percent of women re­\nported experiencing at least one\
      \ trauma in\ntheir lifetime, with witnessing a trauma, being\ninvolved in a\
      \ natural disaster, and/or experi­\nencing a life-threatening accident ranking\
      \ as\nthe most common events (Kessler et al., 1999).\nIn Wave 2 of the National\
      \ Epidemiologic\nSurvey on Alcohol and Related Conditions,\n71.6 percent of\
      \ the sample reported witnessing\ntrauma, 30.7 percent experienced a trauma\n\
      that resulted in injury, and 17.3 percent expe­\nrienced psychological trauma\
      \ (El-Gabalawy,\n2012). For a thorough review of the impact of\ntrauma on quality\
      \ of life and health and\namong individuals with mental and substance \nuse\
      \ disorders, refer to Part 3 of this TIP, the \nonline literature review. \n\
      Rationale for TIC \nIntegrating TIC into behavioral health ser­\nvices provides\
      \ many benefits not only for cli­\nents, but also for their families and\ncommunities,\
      \ for behavioral health service \norganizations, and for staff. Trauma-informed\n\
      services bring to the forefront the belief that \ntrauma can pervasively affect\
      \ an individual’s \nwell-being, including physical and mental \nhealth. For\
      \ behavioral health service providers,\ntrauma-informed practice offers many\
      \ oppor­\ntunities. It reinforces the importance of ac­\nquiring trauma-specific\
      \ knowledge and skills \nto meet the specific needs of clients; of recog­\n\
      nizing that individuals may be affected by \ntrauma regardless of its acknowledgment;\
      \ of \nunderstanding that trauma likely affects many \nclients who are seeking\
      \ behavioral health ser­\nvices; and of acknowledging that organizations\nand\
      \ providers can retraumatize clients through\nstandard or unexamined policies\
      \ and practices.\nTIC stresses the importance of addressing the \nclient individually\
      \ rather than applying gen­\neral treatment approaches. \nTIC provides clients\
      \ more opportunities to\nengage in services that reflect a compassionate \n\
      perspective of their presenting problems. TIC\ncan potentially provide a greater\
      \ sense of safe­\nty for clients who have histories of trauma and\na platform\
      \ for preventing more serious conse­\nquences of traumatic stress (Fallot &\
      \ Harris,\n2001). Although many individuals may not\nidentify the need to connect\
      \ with their histo­\nries, trauma-informed services offer clients a\nchance\
      \ to explore the impact of trauma, their\nstrengths and creative adaptations\
      \ in manag­\ning traumatic histories, their resilience, and the\nrelationships\
      \ among trauma, substance use,\nand psychological symptoms. \n8"

      \ \nThe history of trauma raises various clinical issues. Many counselors do\
      \ not have extensive training in \ntreating trauma or offering trauma-informed\
      \ services and may be uncertain of how to respond to \nclients’ trauma-related\
      \ reactions or symptoms. Some counselors have experienced traumas them­\nselves\
      \ that may be triggered by clients’ reports of trauma. Others are interested\
      \ in helping clients \nwith trauma but may unwittingly cause harm by moving\
      \ too deeply or quickly into trauma material or \nby discounting or disregarding\
      \ a client’s report of trauma. Counselors must be aware of trauma-\nrelated\
      \ symptoms and disorders and how they affect clients in behavioral health treatment.\
      \  \nCounselors with primary treatment responsibilities should also have an\
      \ understanding of how to rec­\nognize trauma-related reactions, how to incorporate\
      \ treatment interventions for trauma-related \nsymptoms into clients’ treatment\
      \ plans, how to help clients build a safety net to prevent further \ntrauma,\
      \ how to conduct psychoeducational interventions, and when to make treatment\
      \ referrals for \nfurther evaluations or trauma-specific treatment services.\
      \ All treatment staff should recognize that \ntraumatic stress symptoms or trauma-related\
      \ disorders should not preclude an individual from mental \nhealth or substance\
      \ abuse treatment and that all co-occurring disorders need to be addressed on\
      \ \nsome level in the treatment plan and setting. For example, helping a client\
      \ in substance abuse treat­\nment gain control over trauma-related symptoms\
      \ can greatly improve the client’s chances of sub­\nstance abuse recovery and\
      \ lower the possibility of relapse (Farley, Golding, Young, Mulligan, & \nMinkoff,\
      \ 2004; Ouimette, Ahrens, Moos, & Finney, 1998). In addition, assisting a client\
      \ in achieving \nabstinence builds a platform upon which recovery from traumatic\
      \ stress can proceed. \nPart 1, Chapter 1—Trauma-Informed Care: A Sociocultural\
      \ Perspective \nImplementing trauma-informed services can\nimprove screening\
      \ and assessment processes,\ntreatment planning, and placement while also\n\
      decreasing the risk for retraumatization. The\nimplementation may enhance communication\n\
      between the client and treatment provider,\nthus decreasing risks associated\
      \ with misun­\nderstanding the client’s reactions and present­\ning problems\
      \ or underestimating the need for\nappropriate referrals for evaluation or trauma-\n\
      specific treatment. Organizational investment\nin developing or improving trauma-informed\n\
      services may also translate to cost effective­\nness, in that services are more\
      \ appropriately \nmatched to clients from the outset. TIC is an \nessential\
      \ ingredient in organizational risk \nmanagement; it ensures the implementation\
      \ of\ndecisions that will optimize therapeutic out­\ncomes and minimize adverse\
      \ effects on the \nclient and, ultimately, the organization. A key \nprinciple\
      \ is the engagement of community,\nclients, and staff. Clients and staff are\
      \ more \napt to be empowered, invested, and satisfied if\nthey are involved\
      \ in the ongoing development\nand delivery of trauma-informed services. \nAn\
      \ organization also benefits from work de­\nvelopment practices through planning\
      \ for,\nattracting, and retaining a diverse workforce of \nindividuals who are\
      \ knowledgeable about\ntrauma and its impact. Developing a trauma-\ninformed\
      \ organization involves hiring and\npromotional practices that attract and retain\n\
      individuals who are educated and trained in \ntrauma-informed practices on all\
      \ levels of the \norganization, including board as well as peer\nsupport appointments.\
      \ Trauma-informed or­\nganizations are invested in their staff and\nadopt similar\
      \ trauma-informed principles,\nincluding establishing and providing ongoing\n\
      support to promote TIC in practice and in \naddressing secondary trauma and\
      \ implement­\ning processes that reinforce the safety of the\nstaff. Even though\
      \ investing in a trauma-\ninformed workforce does not necessarily guar­\nantee\
      \ trauma-informed practices, it is more \nlikely that services will evolve more\
      \ profi­\nciently to meet client, staff, and community \nneeds. \n9"

      \ \nTrauma and Substance Use \nDisorders \nMany people who have substance use\
      \ disor­\nders have experienced trauma as children or\nadults (Koenen, Stellman,\
      \ Sommer, &\nStellman, 2008; Ompad et al., 2005). Sub­\nstance abuse is known\
      \ to predispose people to\nhigher rates of traumas, such as dangerous \nsituations\
      \ and accidents, while under the in­\nfluence (Stewart & Conrod, 2003; Zinzow,\
      \ \nResnick, Amstadter, McCauley, Ruggiero, &\nKilpatrick, 2010) and as a result\
      \ of the lifestyle \nassociated with substance abuse (Reynolds et\nal., 2005).\
      \ In addition, people who abuse sub­\nstances and have experienced trauma have\n\
      worse treatment outcomes than those without \nhistories of trauma (Driessen\
      \ et al., 2008;\nNajavits et al., 2007). Thus, the process of re­\ncovery is\
      \ more difficult, and the counselor’s \nrole is more challenging, when clients\
      \ have \nhistories of trauma. A person presenting with\nboth trauma and substance\
      \ abuse issues can \nhave a variety of other difficult life problems \nthat\
      \ commonly accompany these disorders,\nsuch as other psychological symptoms\
      \ or men­\ntal disorders, poverty, homelessness, increased\nrisk of HIV and\
      \ other infections, and lack of\nsocial support (Mills, Teesson, Ross, & Peters,\n\
      2006; Najavits, Weiss, & Shaw, 1997). Many\nindividuals who seek treatment for\
      \ substance \nuse disorders have histories of one or more \ntraumas. More than\
      \ half of women seeking\nsubstance abuse treatment report one or more \nlifetime\
      \ traumas (Farley, Golding, Young,\nMulligan, & Minkoff, 2004; Najavits et al.,\n\
      1997), and a significant number of clients in\ninpatient treatment also have\
      \ subclinical\ntraumatic stress symptoms or posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD;\
      \ Falck, Wang, Siegal, & \nCarlson, 2004; Grant et al., 2004; Reynolds et\n\
      al., 2005). \nTrauma and Mental Disorders \nPeople who are receiving treatment\
      \ for severe \nmental disorders are more likely to have histo­\nries of trauma,\
      \ including childhood physical\nand sexual abuse, serious accidents, homeless­\n\
      ness, involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations,\ndrug overdoses, interpersonal\
      \ violence, and\nother forms of violence. Many clients with\nsevere mental disorders\
      \ meet criteria for \nPTSD; others with serious mental illness who\nhave histories\
      \ of trauma present with psycho­\nlogical symptoms or mental disorders that\
      \ are\ncommonly associated with a history of trauma, \nincluding anxiety symptoms\
      \ and disorders, \nmood disorders (e.g., major depression, dys­\nthymia, bipolar\
      \ disorder; Mueser et al., 2004),\nimpulse control disorders, and substance\
      \ use \ndisorders (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters,\n2005). \nTraumatic stress\
      \ increases the risk for mental \nillness, and findings suggest that traumatic\n\
      stress increases the symptom severity of men­\ntal illness (Spitzer, Vogel,\
      \ Barnow, Freyberger\n& Grabe, 2007). These findings propose that\ntraumatic\
      \ stress plays a significant role in per­\npetuating and exacerbating mental\
      \ illness and\nsuggest that trauma often precedes the devel­\nopment of mental\
      \ disorders. As with trauma\nand substance use disorders, there is a bidirec­\n\
      tional relationship; mental illness increases the \nrisk of experiencing trauma,\
      \ and trauma in­\ncreases the risk of developing psychological\nsymptoms and\
      \ mental disorders. For a more \ncomprehensive review of the interactions \n\
      among traumatic stress, mental illness, and\nsubstance use disorders, refer\
      \ to Part 3 of this\nTIP, the online literature review. \n10"

      \ Services  \nRecognizing that trauma affects a majority of clients served within\
      \ public health systems, the National \nCenter for Trauma-Informed Care (NCTIC)\
      \ has sought to establish a comprehensive framework to \nguide systems of care\
      \ in the development of trauma-informed services. If a system or program is\
      \ to \nsupport the needs of trauma survivors, it must take a systematic approach\
      \ that offers trauma-specific \ndiagnostic and treatment services, as well as\
      \ a trauma-informed environment that is able to sustain \nsuch services, while\
      \ fostering positive outcomes for the clients it serves. NCTIC also offers technical\
      \ \nassistance in the implementation of trauma-informed services. For specific\
      \ administrative information \non TIC implementation, refer to Part 2, Chapters\
      \ 1 and 2, of this TIP. \n“A program, organization, or system that \nis trauma\
      \ -informed realizes the widespread \nimpact of trauma and under -stands poten\
      \ -\ntial paths for healing; recognizes the signs \nand symptoms of trauma in\
      \ staff, clients, \nand others involved with the system; and \nresponds by fully\
      \ integrating knowledge \nabout trauma into policies, procedures, \npractices,\
      \ and settings.” \n(SAMHSA, 2012, p. 4) \nPart 1, Chapter 1—Trauma-Informed\
      \ Care: A Sociocultural Perspective \nTrauma-Informed \nIntervention and \n\
      Treatment Principles \nTIC is an intervention and organizational \napproach\
      \ that focuses on how trauma may \naffect an individual’s life and his or her\
      \ re­\nsponse to behavioral health services from pre­\nvention through treatment.\
      \ There are many \ndefinitions of TIC and various models for \nincorporating\
      \ it across organizations, but a \n“trauma-informed approach incorporates three\
      \ \nkey elements: (1) realizing the prevalence of \ntrauma; (2) recognizing\
      \ how trauma affects all \nindividuals involved with the program, organi­\n\
      zation, or system, including its own workforce; \nand (3) responding by putting\
      \ this knowledge \ninto practice”  (SAMHSA, 2012, p. 4). \nTIC begins with the\
      \ first contact a person has \nwith an agency; it requires all staff members\
      \ \n(e.g., receptionists, intake personnel, direct \ncare staff, supervisors,\
      \ administrators, peer \nsupports, board members) to recognize that \nthe individual’s\
      \ experience of trauma can \ngreatly influence his or her receptivity to and\
      \ \nengagement with services, interactions with \nstaff and clients, and responsiveness\
      \ to pro­\ngram guidelines, practices, and interventions. \nTIC includes program\
      \ policies, procedures, \nand practices to protect the vulnerabilities of \n\
      those who have experienced trauma and those \nwho provide trauma-related services.\
      \ TIC is \ncreated through a supportive environment and \nby redesigning organizational\
      \ practices, with \nconsumer participation, to prevent practices\nthat could\
      \ be retraumatizing (Harris & Fallot,\n2001c; Hopper et al., 2010). The ethical\
      \ prin­\nciple, “first, do no harm,” resonates strongly in \nthe application\
      \ of TIC. \nTIC involves a commitment to building com­\npetence among staff\
      \ and establishing pro­\ngrammatic standards and clinical guidelines \nthat\
      \ support the delivery of trauma-sensitive \nservices. It encompasses recruiting,\
      \ hiring, and \nretaining competent staff; involving consum­\ners, trauma survivors,\
      \ and peer support special­\nists in the planning, implementation, and \nevaluation\
      \ of trauma-informed services; devel­\noping collaborations across service systems\
      \ to \nstreamline referral processes, thereby securing \ntrauma-specific services\
      \ when appropriate; and \nbuilding a continuity of TIC as consumers \nmove from\
      \ one system or service to the next. \nTIC involves reevaluating each service\
      \ deliv­\nery component through a trauma-aware lens. \nThe principles described\

      \ a com­\npilation of resources, including research, theo­\nretical papers,\
      \ commentaries, and lessons \nlearned from treatment facilities. Key elements\n\
      are outlined for each principle in providing\nservices to clients affected by\
      \ trauma and to\npopulations most likely to incur trauma.\nAlthough these principles\
      \ are useful across all \nprevention and intervention services, settings,\n\
      and populations, they are of the utmost im­\nportance in working with people\
      \ who have \nhad traumatic experiences. \nPromote Trauma Awareness and \nUnderstanding\
      \ \nForemost, a behavioral health service provider\nmust recognize the prevalence\
      \ of trauma and\nits possible role in an individual’s emotional,\nbehavioral,\
      \ cognitive, spiritual, and/or physical\ndevelopment, presentation, and well-being.\
      \ \nBeing vigilant about the prevalence and po­\ntential consequences of traumatic\
      \ events \namong clients allows counselors to tailor their\npresentation styles,\
      \ theoretical approaches, and\nintervention strategies from the outset to plan\n\
      for and be responsive to clients’ specific needs.\nAlthough not every client\
      \ has a history of\ntrauma, those who have substance use and\nmental disorders\
      \ are more likely to have expe­\nrienced trauma. Being trauma aware does not\n\
      mean that you must assume everyone has a\nhistory of trauma, but rather that\
      \ you antici­\npate the possibility from your initial contact\nand interactions,\
      \ intake processes, and screen­\ning and assessment procedures. \nEven the most\
      \ standard behavioral health \npractices can retraumatize an individual ex­\n\
      posed to prior traumatic experiences if the \nprovider implements them without\
      \ recogniz­\ning or considering that they may do harm. For\nexample, a counselor\
      \ might develop a treat­\nment plan recommending that a female cli­\nent—who\
      \ has been court mandated to \nsubstance abuse treatment and was raped as an\n\
      adult—attend group therapy, but without con­\nsidering the implications, for\
      \ her, of the fact\nthat the only available group at the facility is\nall male\
      \ and has had a low historical rate of \nfemale participation. Trauma awareness\
      \ is an\nessential strategy for preventing this type of\nretraumatization; it\
      \ reinforces the need for\nproviders to reevaluate their usual practices. \n\
      Becoming trauma aware does not stop with\nthe recognition that trauma can affect\
      \ clients;\ninstead, it encompasses a broader awareness \nthat traumatic experiences\
      \ as well as the im­\npact of an individual’s trauma can extend to \nsignificant\
      \ others, family members, first re­\nsponders and other medical professionals,\
      \ be­\nhavioral health workers, broader social \nnetworks, and even entire communities.\
      \ Fami­\nly members frequently experience the trau­\nmatic stress reactions\
      \ of the individual family \nmember who was traumatized (e.g., angry \noutbursts,\
      \ nightmares, avoidant behavior, other\nsymptoms of anxiety, overreactions or\
      \ underre­\nactions to stressful events). These repetitive \nexperiences can\
      \ increase the risk of secondary \ntrauma and symptoms of mental illness among\n\
      the family, heighten the risk for externalizing\nand internalizing behavior\
      \ among children\n(e.g., bullying others, problems in social rela­\ntionships,\
      \ health-damaging behaviors), in­\ncrease children’s risk for developing\nposttraumatic\
      \ stress later in life, and lead to a \ngreater propensity for traumatic stress\
      \ reac­\ntions across generations of the family. Hence,\nprevention and intervention\
      \ services can pro­\nvide education and age-appropriate program­\nming tailored\
      \ to develop coping skills and\nsupport systems. \n12"

      \ Perspective \nSo too, behavioral health service providers can \nbe influenced\
      \ by exposure to trauma-related\naffect and content when working with clients.\n\
      A trauma-aware workplace supports supervi­\nsion and program practices that\
      \ educate all \ndirect service staff members on secondary \ntrauma, encourages\
      \ the processing of trauma-\nrelated content through participation in peer-\n\
      supported activities and clinical supervision,\nand provides them with professional\
      \ develop­\nment opportunities to learn about and engage\nin effective coping\
      \ strategies that help prevent \nsecondary trauma or trauma-related symp­\n\
      toms. It is important to generate trauma\nawareness in agencies through education\n\
      across services and among all staff members \nwho have any direct or indirect\
      \ contact with\nclients (including receptionists or intake and\nadmission personnel\
      \ who engage clients for\nthe first time within the agency). Agencies can\n\
      maintain a trauma-aware environment \nthrough ongoing staff training, continued\
      \ su­\npervisory and administrative support, collabo­\nrative (i.e., involving\
      \ consumer participation)\ntrauma-responsive program design and im­\nplementation,\
      \ and organizational policies and\npractices that reflect accommodation and\
      \ flex­\nibility in attending to the needs of clients af­\nfected by trauma.\
      \ \nRecognize That Trauma-Related \nSymptoms and Behaviors \nOriginate From\
      \ Adapting to \nTraumatic Experiences \nA trauma-informed perspective views\
      \ trauma-\nrelated symptoms and behaviors as an individ­\nual’s best and most\
      \ resilient attempt to man­\nage, cope with, and rise above his or her \nexperience\
      \ of trauma. Some individuals’ means \nof adapting and coping have produced\
      \ little\ndifficulty; the coping and adaptive strategies of \nothers have worked\
      \ in the past but are not\nworking as well now. Some people have diffi­\nculties\
      \ in one area of life but have effectively \nnegotiated and functioned in other\
      \ areas. \nIndividuals who have survived trauma vary \nwidely in how they experience\
      \ and express \ntraumatic stress reactions.Traumatic stress \nreactions vary\
      \ in severity; they are often meas­\nured by the level of impairment or distress\
      \ that\nclients report and are determined by the mul­\ntiple factors that characterize\
      \ the trauma itself,\nindividual history and characteristics, devel­\nopmental\
      \ factors, sociocultural attributes, and\navailable resources. The characteristics\
      \ of the \ntrauma and the subsequent traumatic stress \nreactions can dramatically\
      \ influence how indi­\nviduals respond to the environment, relation­\nships,\
      \ interventions, and treatment services,\nand those same characteristics can\
      \ also shape \nthe assumptions that clients/consumers make \nabout their world\
      \ (e.g., their view of others,\nsense of safety), their future (e.g., hopefulness,\n\
      fear of a foreshortened future), and themselves \n(e.g., feeling resilient,\
      \ feeling incompetent in\nregulating emotions). The breadth of these \neffects\
      \ may be observable or subtle. \nOnce you become aware of the significance of\n\
      traumatic experiences in clients’ lives and \nbegin to view their presentation\
      \ as adaptive,\nyour identification and classification of their\npresenting\
      \ symptoms and behaviors can shift\nfrom a “pathology” mindset (i.e., defining\
      \ cli­\nents strictly from a diagnostic label, implying\nthat something is wrong\
      \ with them) to one of\nresilience—a mindset that views clients’ pre­\nsenting\
      \ difficulties, behaviors, and emotions as \nresponses to surviving trauma.\
      \ In essence, you \nwill come to view traumatic stress reactions as \nnormal\
      \ reactions to abnormal situations. In \nembracing the belief that trauma-related\
      \ reac­\ntions are adaptive, you can begin relationships\nwith clients from\
      \ a hopeful, strengths-based\nstance that builds upon the belief that their\n\
      responses to traumatic experiences reflect\ncreativity, self-preservation, and\
      \ determination. \n13"

      \ \nThis will help build mutual and collaborative \ntherapeutic relationships,\
      \ help clients identify \nwhat has worked and has not worked in their \nattempts\
      \ to deal with the aftermath of trauma\nfrom a nonjudgmental stance, and develop\n\
      intervention and coping strategies that are\nmore likely to fit their strengths\
      \ and resources.\nThis view of trauma prevents further retrau­\nmatization by\
      \ not defining traumatic stress\nreactions as pathological or as symptoms of\n\
      pathology. \nView Trauma in the Context of \nIndividuals’ Environments \nMany\
      \ factors contribute to a person’s response \nto trauma, whether it is an individual,\
      \ group,\nor community-based trauma. Individual at­\ntributes, developmental\
      \ factors (including pro­\ntective and risk factors), life history, type of\n\
      trauma, specific characteristics of the trauma,\namount and length of trauma\
      \ exposure, cultur­\nal meaning of traumatic events, number of\nlosses associated\
      \ with the trauma, available \nresources (internal and external, such as coping\n\
      skills and family support), and community \nreactions are a few of the determinants\
      \ that \ninfluence a person’s responses to trauma across \ntime. Refer to the\
      \ “View Trauma Through a \nSociocultural Lens” section later in this chap­\n\
      ter for more specific information highlighting\nthe importance of culture in\
      \ understanding\nand treating the effects of trauma. \nTrauma cannot be viewed\
      \ narrowly; instead, it\nneeds to be seen through a broader lens—a \ncontextual\
      \ lens integrating biopsychosocial,\ninterpersonal, community, and societal\
      \ (the \ndegree of individualistic or collective cultural \nvalues) characteristics\
      \ that are evident preced­\ning and during the trauma, in the immediate\nand\
      \ sustained response to the event(s), and in\nthe short- and long-term effects\
      \ of the trau­\nmatic event(s), which may include housing\navailability, community\
      \ response, adherence to \nor maintenance of family routines and struc­\nture,\
      \ and level of family support. \nTo more adequately understand trauma, you \n\
      must also consider the contexts in which it \noccurred. Understanding trauma\
      \ from this \nangle helps expand the focus beyond individu­\nal characteristics\
      \ and effects to a broader sys­\ntemic perspective that acknowledges the \n\
      influences of social interactions, communities,\ngovernments, cultures, and\
      \ so forth, while also\nexamining the possible interactions among\nthose various\
      \ influences. Bronfenbrenner’s \n(1979) and Bronfenbrenner and Ceci’s (1994)\
      \ \nwork on ecological models sparked the devel­\nopment of other contextual\
      \ models. In recent\nyears, the social-ecological framework has \nbeen adopted\
      \ in understanding trauma, in\nimplementing health promotion and other\nprevention\
      \ strategies, and in developing treat­\nment interventions (Centers for Disease\
      \ Con­\ntrol and Prevention, 2009). Here are the three \nmain beliefs of a social-ecological\
      \ approach\n(Stokols, 1996):\n•  Environmental factors greatly influence \n\
      emotional, physical, and social well-being. \n•  A fundamental determinant of\
      \ health ver­\nsus illness is the degree of fit between indi­\nviduals’ biological,\
      \ behavioral, and\nsociocultural needs and the resources avail­\nable to them.\
      \ \n•  Prevention, intervention, and treatment\napproaches integrate a combination\
      \ of\nstrategies targeting individual, interperson­\nal, and community systems.\
      \ \nThis TIP uses a social-ecological model to\nexplore trauma and its effects\
      \ (Exhibit 1.1-2).\nThe focus of this model is not only on nega­\ntive attributes\
      \ (risk factors) across each level,\nbut also on positive ingredients (protective\
      \ \nfactors) that protect against or lessen the im­\npact of trauma. This model\
      \ also guides the \ninclusion of certain targeted interventions in\nthis text,\
      \ including selective and indicated \n14\n\n[Page 37]\nPart 1, Chapter 1—Trauma-Informed\

      \ occurred can signifi­\ncantly influence how a trauma is perceived and\nprocessed,\
      \ how an individual or community \nengages in help-seeking, and the degree of\n\

      \ \nThe social-ecological model depicted in Ex­\nhibit 1.1-2 provides a systemic\
      \ framework for\nlooking at individuals, families, and communi­\nties affected\
      \ by trauma in general; it highlights\nthe bidirectional influence that multiple\
      \ con­\ntexts can have on the provision of behavioral\nhealth services to people\
      \ who have experi­\nenced trauma (see thin arrow). Each ring rep­\nresents a\
      \ different system (refer to Exhibit \n1.1-3 for examples of specific factors\
      \ within\neach system). The innermost ring represents \nthe individual and his\
      \ or her biopsychosocial\ncharacteristics. The “Interpersonal” circle em­\n\
      bodies all immediate relationships including\nfamily, friends, peers, and others.\
      \ The “Com­\nmunity/Organizational” band represents social \nsupport networks,\
      \ workplaces, neighborhoods,\nand institutions that directly influence the\n\
      individual and his/her relationships. The “So­\ncietal” circle signifies the\
      \ largest system—State \nand Federal policies and laws, such as eco­\nnomic\
      \ and healthcare policies, social norms,\ngovernmental systems, and political\
      \ ideologies.\nThe outermost ring, “Period of Time in His­\ntory,” reflects\
      \ the significance of the period of\ntime during which the event occurred; it\
      \ influ­\nences each other level represented in the circle.\nFor example, making\

      \ of being overwhelmed—such a perspective sends strong messages to clients \n\
      that their experiences are not important, that they are not capable of handling\
      \ their trauma-\nassociated feelings, and that dealing with traumatic experiences\
      \ is simply too dangerous. Statements \nlike these imply that recovery is not\
      \ possible and provide no structured outlet to address memories \nof trauma\
      \ or traumatic stress reactions.  \nNevertheless, determining how and when to\
      \ address traumatic stress in behavioral health services \ncan be a real dilemma,\
      \ especially if there are no trauma-specific philosophical, programmatic, or\
      \ \nprocedural processes in place. For example, it is difficult to provide an\
      \ appropriate forum for a client \nto address past traumas if no forethought\
      \ has been given to developing interagency and intra-\nagency collaborations\
      \ for trauma-specific services. By anticipating the need for trauma-informed\
      \ \nservices and planning ahead to provide appropriate services to people who\
      \ are affected by trauma, \nbehavioral health service providers and program\
      \ administrators can begin to develop informed inter­\nvention strategies that\
      \ send a powerful, positive message: \n• \nBoth clients and providers can competently\
      \ manage traumatic experiences and reactions. \n• \nProviders are interested\
      \ in hearing clients’ stories and attending to their experiences.  \n• \nRecovery\
      \ is possible. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \ncircumstances\
      \ before, during, and after that \ntrauma, so remember that even seemingly safe\
      \ \nand standard treatment policies and proce­\ndures, including physical plant\
      \ operations (e.g.,\nmaintenance, grounds, fire and safety proce­\ndures), may\
      \ feel quite the contrary for a client\nif one or more of those elements is\
      \ reminiscent \nof his or her experience of trauma in some \nway. Examples include\
      \ having limited privacy \nor personal space, being interviewed in a room \n\
      that feels too isolating or confining, undergo­\ning physical examination by\
      \ a medical profes­\nsional of the same sex as the client’s previous \nperpetrator\
      \ of abuse, attending a group session\nin which another client expresses anger\
      \ appro­\npriately in a role play, or being directed not to\ntalk about distressing\
      \ experiences as a means \nof deescalating traumatic stress reactions. \nAlthough\
      \ some treatment policies or proce­\ndures are more obviously likely to solicit\
      \ dis­\ntress than others, all standard practices should \nbe evaluated for\
      \ their potential to retraumatize \na client; this cannot be done without knowing\n\
      the specific features of the individual’s history \nof trauma. Consider, for\
      \ instance, a treatment\nprogram that serves meals including entrees \nthat\
      \ combine more than one food group. Your\nclient enters this program and refuses\
      \ to eat\nmost of the time; he expresses anger toward\ndietary staff and claims\
      \ that food choices are\nlimited. You may initially perceive your cli­\nent’s\
      \ refusal to eat or to avoid certain foods as \nan eating disorder or a behavioral\
      \ problem.\nHowever, a trauma-aware perspective might\nchange your assumptions;\
      \ consider that this \nclient experienced neglect and abuse sur­\nrounding food\
      \ throughout childhood (his\nmother forced him to eat meals prepared by \ncombining\
      \ anything in the refrigerator and\ncooking them together). \n18"

      \ counseling to Mike, you explain that he can call an agency \nnumber that will\
      \ put him in direct contact with someone who can provide further assistance\
      \ or sup­\nport if he has emotional difficulty after the session or after agency\
      \ hours. However, when he attempts \nto call one night, no one is available\
      \ despite what you’ve described. Instead, Mike is directed by an \noperator\
      \ to either use his local emergency room if he perceives his situation to be\
      \ a crisis or to wait \nfor someone on call to contact him. The inconsistency\
      \ between what you told him in the session and \nwhat actually happens when\
      \ he calls makes Mike feel unsafe and vulnerable. \nPart 1, Chapter 1—Trauma-Informed\
      \ Care: A Sociocultural Perspective \nAs a treatment provider, you cannot consist­\n\
      ently predict what may or may not be upset­\nting or retraumatizing to clients.\
      \ Therefore, it\nis important to maintain vigilance and an atti­\ntude of curiosity\
      \ with clients, inquiring about\nthe concerns that they express and/or present\n\
      in treatment. Remember that certain behaviors \nor emotional expressions can\
      \ reflect what has \nhappened to them in the past. \nForemost, a trauma-informed\
      \ approach begins\nwith taking practical steps to reexamine treat­\nment strategies,\
      \ program procedures, and or­\nganizational polices that could solicit distress\
      \ \nor mirror common characteristics of traumatic \nexperiences (loss of control,\
      \ being trapped, or\nfeeling disempowered). To better anticipate \nthe interplay\
      \ between various treatment ele­\nments and the more idiosyncratic aspects of\
      \ a\nparticular client’s trauma history, you can: \n•  Work with the client\
      \ to learn the cues he or \nshe associates with past trauma. \n•  Obtain a good\
      \ history. \n•  Maintain a supportive, empathetic, and\ncollaborative relationship.\
      \ \n•  Encourage ongoing dialog. \n•  Provide a clear message of availability\
      \ and\naccessibility throughout treatment. \nIn sum, trauma-informed providers\
      \ anticipate\nand respond to potential practices that may be\nperceived or experienced\
      \ as retraumatizing to\nclients; they are able to forge new ways to re­\nspond\
      \ to specific situations that trigger a\ntrauma-related response, and they can\
      \ provide \nclients with alternative ways of engaging in a \nparticularly problematic\
      \ element of treatment. \nCreate a Safe Environment \nThe need to create a safe\
      \ environment is not \nnew to providers; it involves an agency-wide \neffort\
      \ supported by effective policies and pro­\ncedures. However, creating safety\
      \ within a\ntrauma-informed framework far exceeds the \nstandard expectations\
      \ of physical plant safety \n(e.g., facility, environmental, and space-related\n\
      concerns), security (of staff members, clients,\nand personal property), policies\
      \ and proce­\ndures (including those specific to seclusion\nand restraint),\
      \ emergency management and\ndisaster planning, and adherence to client\nrights.\
      \ Providers must be responsive and adapt\nthe environment to establish and support\
      \ cli­\nents’ sense of physical and emotional safety. \nBeyond anticipating\
      \ that various environ­\nmental stimuli within a program may generate \nstrong\
      \ emotions and reactions in a trauma \nsurvivor (e.g., triggers such as lighting,\
      \ access\nto exits, seating arrangements, emotionality \nwithin a group, or\
      \ visual or auditory stimuli)\nand implementing strategies to help clients \n\
      cope with triggers that evoke their experiences \nwith trauma, other key elements\
      \ in establish­\ning a safe environment include consistency in\nclient interactions\
      \ and treatment processes,\nfollowing through with what has been re­\nviewed\
      \ or agreed upon in sessions or meetings,\nand dependability. Mike’s case illustration\
      \ de­\npicts ways in which the absence of these key \nelements could erode a\
      \ client’s sense of safety \nduring the treatment process. \nNeither providers\

      \ female counselor, had a nephew who took his own life. The program that hired\
      \ \nher was short of workers at the time; therefore, Jane did not have an opportunity\
      \ to engage suffi­\nciently in orientation outside of reviewing the policies\
      \ and procedure manual. In an attempt to pre­\nsent well to her new employer\
      \ and supervisor, she readily accepted client assignments without \nconsidering\
      \ her recent loss. By not immersing herself in the program’s perspective and\
      \ policies on \nstaff well-being, ethical and clinical considerations in client\
      \ assignments, and how and when to seek \nsupervision, Jane failed to engage\
      \ in the practices, heavily supported by the agency, that promoted \nsafety\
      \ for herself and her clients. Subsequently, she felt emotionally overwhelmed\
      \ at work and would \noften abruptly request psychiatric evaluation for clients\
      \ who expressed any feelings of hopelessness \nout of sheer panic that they\
      \ would attempt suicide.  \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \nunintentionally relay information inaccurately\nor inconsistently to clients\
      \ or other staff mem­\nbers; other times, clients mishear something, \nor extenuating\
      \ circumstances prevent provid­\ners from responding as promised. Creating\n\
      safety is not about getting it right all the time;\nit’s about how consistently\
      \ and forthrightly \nyou handle situations with a client when cir­\ncumstances\
      \ provoke feelings of being vulnera­\nble or unsafe. Honest and compassionate\
      \ \ncommunication that conveys a sense of han­\ndling the situation together\
      \ generates safety. It\nis equally important that safety extends be­\nyond the\
      \ client. Counselors and other behav­\nioral health staff members, including\
      \ peer\nsupport specialists, need to be able to count on\nthe agency to be responsive\
      \ to and maintain\ntheir safety within the environment as well. By \nincorporating\
      \ an organizational ethos that\nrecognizes the importance of practices that\
      \ \npromote physical safety and emotional well­\nbeing, behavioral health staff\
      \ members may be\nmore likely to seek support and supervision\nwhen needed and\
      \ to comply with clinical and \nprogrammatic practices that minimize risks\n\
      for themselves and their clients. \nBeyond an attitudinal promotion of safety,\n\
      organizational leaders need to consider and \ncreate avenues of professional\
      \ development\nand assistance that will give their staff the\nmeans to seek\
      \ support and process distressing\ncircumstances or events that occur within\
      \ the \nagency or among their clientele, such as case \nconsultation and supervision,\
      \ formal or infor­\nmal processes to debrief service providers \nabout difficult\
      \ clinical issues, and referral pro­\ncesses for client psychological evaluations\
      \ and\nemployee assistance for staff. Organizational\npractices are only effective\
      \ if supported by \nunswerving trauma awareness, training, and\neducation among\
      \ staff. Jane’s case illustration \nshows the impact of a minor but necessary\
      \ \npostponement in staff orientation for a new\nhire—not an unusual circumstance\
      \ in behav­\nioral health programs that have heavy case­\nloads and high staff\
      \ turnover. \nIdentify Recovery From Trauma as \na Primary Goal \nOften, people\
      \ who initiate or are receiving\nmental health or substance abuse services don’t\
      \ \nidentify their experiences with trauma as a \nsignificant factor in their\
      \ current challenges or\nproblems. In part, this is because people who\nhave\
      \ been exposed to trauma, whether once or\nrepeatedly, are generally reluctant\
      \ to revisit it.\nThey may already feel stuck in repetitive \nmemories or experiences,\
      \ which may add to\ntheir existing belief that any intervention will\nmake matters\
      \ worse or, at least, no better. For\nsome clients, any introduction to their\
      \ trauma-\nrelated memories or minor cues reminiscent of \nthe trauma will cause\
      \ them to experience \nstrong, quick-to-surface emotions, supporting\ntheir\

      \ Others readily view their\nexperiences of trauma as being in the past; as\
      \ a \nresult, they engage in distraction, dissociation,\nand/or avoidance (as\
      \ well as adaptation) due to\na belief that trauma has little impact on their\n\
      current lives and presenting problems. Even\nindividuals who are quite aware\
      \ of the impact\nthat trauma has had on their lives may still \nstruggle to\
      \ translate or connect how these \nevents continue to shape their choices, behav­\n\
      iors, and emotions. Many survivors draw no\nconnection between trauma and their\
      \ mental \nhealth or substance abuse problems, which\nmakes it more difficult\
      \ for them to see the \nvalue of trauma-informed or trauma-specific \ninterventions,\
      \ such as creating safety, engaging\nin psychoeducation, enhancing coping skills,\n\
      and so forth. \nAs a trauma-informed provider, it is important\nthat you help\
      \ clients bridge the gap between\ntheir mental health and substance-related\
      \ is­\nsues and the traumatic experiences they may \nhave had. All too often,\
      \ trauma occurs before \nsubstance use and mental disorders develop;\nthen,\
      \ such disorders and their associated \nsymptoms and consequences create opportuni­\n\
      ties for additional traumatic events to occur. If \nindividuals engage in mental\
      \ health and sub­\nstance abuse treatment without addressing the \nrole that\
      \ trauma has played in their lives, they \nare less likely to experience recovery\
      \ in the \nlong run. For example, a person with a history \nof trauma is more\
      \ likely to have anxiety and\ndepressive symptoms, use substances to self-\n\
      medicate, and/or relapse after exposure to\ntrauma-related cues. Thus, collaboration\
      \ with­\nin and between behavioral health agencies is \nnecessary to make integrated,\
      \ timely, trauma-\nspecific interventions available from the be­\nginning to\
      \ clients/consumers who engage in\nsubstance abuse and mental health services.\

      \ trauma\nand is engaged in behavioral health services \nwants, or sees the\
      \ need for, trauma-informed\nor trauma-specific treatment. Clients may \nthink\
      \ that they’ve already dealt with their\ntrauma adequately, or they may believe\
      \ that \nthe effects of past trauma cause minimal dis­\ntress for them. Other\
      \ clients may voice the \nsame sentiments, but without conviction—\ninstead\
      \ using avoidant behavior to deter dis­\ntressing symptoms or reactions. Still\
      \ others \nmay struggle to see the role of trauma in their\npresenting challenges,\
      \ not connecting their\npast traumatic experiences with other, more \ncurrent\
      \ difficulties (e.g., using substances to\nself-medicate strong emotions). Simply\
      \ the \nidea of acknowledging trauma-related experi­\nences and/or stress reactions\
      \ may be too\nfrightening or overwhelming for some clients,\nand others may\
      \ fear that their reactions will be \ndismissed. On the other hand, some individu­\n\
      als want so much to dispense with their trau­\nmatic experiences and reactions\
      \ that they \nhurriedly and repeatedly disclose their experi­\nences before\
      \ establishing a sufficiently safe \nenvironment or learning effective coping\
      \ strat­\negies to offset distress and other effects of re­\ntraumatization.\

      \ \nto the impact of trauma as adaptive—even\nwhen you believe their methods\
      \ of dealing\nwith trauma to be detrimental—are equally \nimportant elements\
      \ of TIC. By taking the\ntime to engage with clients and understand \nthe ways\
      \ they have perceived, adjusted to, and\nresponded to traumatic experiences,\
      \ providers \nare more likely to project the message that\nclients possess valuable\
      \ personal expertise and\nknowledge about their own presenting prob­\nlems.\
      \ This shifts the viewpoint from “Provid­\ners know best” to the more collaborative\
      \ \n“Together, we can find solutions.” \nHow often have you heard from clients\
      \ that\nthey don’t believe they can handle symptoms \nthat emerge from reexperiencing\
      \ traumatic\ncues or memories? Have you ever heard clients \nstate that they\
      \ can’t trust themselves or their \nreactions, or that they never know when\
      \ they \nare going to be triggered or how they are go­\ning to react? How confident\
      \ would you feel \nabout yourself if, at any time, a loud noise \ncould initiate\
      \ an immediate attempt to hide,\nduck, or dive behind something? Traumatic\n\
      experiences have traditionally been described\nas exposure to events that cause\
      \ intense fear,\nhelplessness, horror, or feelings of loss of con­\ntrol. Participation\
      \ in behavioral health services\nshould not mirror these aspects of traumatic\n\
      experience. Working collaboratively to facili­\ntate clients’ sense of control\
      \ and to maximize \nclients’ autonomy and choices throughout the\ntreatment\
      \ process, including treatment plan­\nning, is crucial in trauma-informed services.\
      \ \nFor some individuals, gaining a sense of con­\ntrol and empowerment, along\
      \ with under­\nstanding traumatic stress reactions, may be \npivotal ingredients\
      \ for recovery. By creating \nopportunities for empowerment, counselors \nand\
      \ other behavioral health service providers\nhelp reinforce, clients’ sense\
      \ of competence, \nwhich is often eroded by trauma and pro­\nlonged traumatic\
      \ stress reactions. Keep in\nmind that treatment strategies and procedures \n\
      that prioritize client choice and control need\nnot focus solely on major life\
      \ decisions or\ntreatment planning; you can apply such ap­\nproaches to common\
      \ tasks and everyday inter­\nactions between staff and consumers. Try\nasking\
      \ your clients some of the following\nquestions (which are only a sample of\
      \ the \ntypes of questions that could be useful):\n•  What information would\
      \ be helpful for us \nto know about what happened to you? \n•  Where/when would\
      \ you like us to call you? \n•  How would you like to be addressed? \n•  Of\
      \ the services I’ve described, which seem\nto match your present concerns and\
      \ needs? \n•  From your experience, what responses from \nothers appear to work\
      \ best when you feel \noverwhelmed by your emotions? \nLikewise, organizations\
      \ need to reinforce the \nimportance of staff autonomy, choice, and\nsense of\
      \ control. What resources can staff \nmembers access, and what choices are availa­\n\
      ble to them, in processing emotionally charged\ncontent or events in treatment?\
      \ How often do \nadministrators and supervisors seek out feed­\nback on how\
      \ to handle problematic situations\n(e.g., staff rotations for vacations, case\
      \ consul­\ntations, changes in scheduling)? Think about\nthe parallel between\
      \ administration and staff\nmembers versus staff members and clients; \noften,\
      \ the same philosophy, attitudes, and\nbehaviors conveyed to staff members by\
      \ ad­\nministrative practices are mirrored in staff–\nclient interactions. Simply\
      \ stated, if staff\nmembers do not feel empowered, it will be a\nchallenge for\
      \ them to value the need for client\nempowerment. (For more information on\n\
      administrative and workforce development\nissues, refer to Part 2, Chapters\
      \ 1 and 2.) \n22"

      \ \nfamily and caregivers. The nonauthoritarian \napproach that characterizes\
      \ TIC views clients \nMina initially sought counseling after her husband was\
      \ admitted to an intensive outpatient drug and \nalcohol program. She was self-referred\
      \ for low-grade depression, resentment toward her spouse, \nand codependency.\
      \ When asked to define “codependency” and how the term applied to her, she \n\
      responded that she always felt guilty and responsible for everyone in her family\
      \ and for events that \noccurred even when she had little or no control over\
      \ them.  \nAfter the intake and screening process, she expressed interest in\
      \ attending group sessions that fo­\ncused primarily on family issues and substance\
      \ abuse, wherein her presenting concerns could be \nexplored. In addition to\
      \ describing dynamics and issues relating to substance abuse and its impact\
      \ \non her marriage, she referred to her low mood as frozen grief. During treatment,\
      \ she reluctantly \nbegan to talk about an event that she described as life\
      \ changing: the loss of her father. The story \nbegan to unfold in group; her\
      \ father, who had been 62 years old, was driving her to visit a cousin. \nDuring\
      \ the ride, he had a heart attack and drove off the road. As the car came to\
      \ stop in a field, she \nremembered calling 911 and beginning cardiopulmonary\
      \ resuscitation while waiting for the ambu­\nlance. She rode with the paramedics\
      \ to the hospital, watching them work to save her father’s life; \nhowever,\
      \ he was pronounced dead soon after arrival.  \nShe always felt that she never\
      \ really said goodbye to her father. In group, she was asked what she \nwould\
      \ need to do or say to feel as if she had revisited that opportunity. She responded\
      \ in quite a \nunique way, saying, “I can’t really answer this question; the\
      \ lighting isn’t right for me to talk about \nmy dad.” The counselor encouraged\
      \ her to adjust the lighting so that it felt “right” to her. Being \ninvited\
      \ to do so turned out to be pivotal in her ability to address her loss and to\
      \ say goodbye to her \nfather on her terms. She spent nearly 10 minutes moving\
      \ the dimmer switch for the lighting as oth­\ners in the group patiently waited\
      \ for her to return to her chair. She then began to talk about what \nhappened\
      \ during the evening of her father’s death, their relationship, the events leading\
      \ up to that \nevening, what she had wanted to say to him at the hospital, and\
      \ the things that she had been want­\ning to share with him since his death.\
      \ \nWeeks later, as the group was coming to a close, each member spoke about\
      \ the most important \nexperiences, tools, and insights that he or she had taken\
      \ from participating. Mina disclosed that the \ngroup helped her establish b\n\
      \ oundaries and coping strategies within her marriage, but said that the \n\
      event that made the most difference for her had been having the ability to adjust\
      \ the lighting in the \nroom. She explained that this had allowed her to control\
      \ something over which she had been pow­\nerless during her father’s death.\
      \ To her, the lighting had seemed to stand out more than other de­\ntails at\
      \ the scene of the accident, during the ambulance ride, and at the hospital.\
      \ She felt that the \npersonal experience of losing her father and needing to\
      \ be with him in the emergency room was \nmarred by the obtrusiveness of staff,\
      \ procedures, machines, and especially, the harsh lighting. She \nreflected\
      \ that she now saw the lighting as a representation of this tragic event and\
      \ the lack of priva­\ncy she had experienced when trying to say goodbye to her\
      \ father. Mina stated that this moment in \ngroup had been the greatest gift:\
      \ “…to be able to say my goodbyes the way I wanted… I was given \nan opportunity\
      \ to have some control over a tragic event where I couldn’t control the outcome\
      \ no \nmatter how hard I tried.” \nPart 1, Chapter 1—Trauma-Informed Care: A\

      \ is to build collaboration \nbeyond the provider–client relationship. \nBuilding\
      \ ongoing relationships across the ser­\nvice system, provider networks, and\
      \ the local \ncommunity enhances TIC continuity as cli­\nents move from one\
      \ level of service to the next \nor when they are involved in multiple services\

      \ clients in the ser­\nvice system or community and to connect with\nproviders\
      \ who have more advanced training in\ntrauma-specific interventions and services.\
      \ \nThe third tenet emphasizes the need to en­\nsure client/consumer representation\
      \ and\nparticipation in behavioral health program\ndevelopment, planning, and\
      \ evaluation as\nwell as in the professional development of\nbehavioral health\
      \ workers. To achieve trau­\nma-informed competence in an organization\nor across\
      \ systems, clients need to play an active \nrole; this starts with providing\
      \ program feed­\nback. However, consumer involvement should\nnot end there;\
      \ rather, it should be encouraged\nthroughout the implementation of trauma-\n\
      informed services. So too, clients, potential \nclients, their families, and\
      \ the community \nshould be invited to participate in forming any\nbehavioral\
      \ health organization’s plans to im­\nprove trauma-informed competence, provide\
      \ \nTIC, and design relevant treatment services \nand organizational policies\
      \ and procedures. \nTrauma-informed principles and practices\ngenerated without\
      \ the input of people affected\nby trauma are difficult to apply effectively.\n\
      Likewise, staff trainings and presentations\nshould include individuals who\
      \ have felt the \nimpact of trauma. Their participation reaches\npast the purely\
      \ cognitive aspects of such edu­\ncation to offer a personal perspective on\
      \ the \nstrengths and resilience of people who have \nexperienced trauma. The\
      \ involvement of\ntrauma survivors in behavioral health educa­\ntion lends a\
      \ human face to subject matter that\nis all too easily made cerebral by some\
      \ staff\nmembers in an attempt to avoid the emotion­\nality of the topic. \n\
      Consumer participation also means giving\nclients/consumers the chance to obtain\
      \ State\ntraining and certification, as well as employ­\nment in behavioral\
      \ health settings as peer spe­\ncialists. Programs that incorporate peer\nsupport\
      \ services reinforce a powerful mes-\nsage—that provider–consumer partnership\
      \ is \nimportant, and that consumers are valued.\nPeer support specialists are\
      \ self-identified in­\ndividuals who have progressed in their own \nrecovery\
      \ from alcohol dependence, drug ad­\ndiction, and/or a mental disorder and work\
      \ \nwithin behavioral health programs or at peer\nsupport centers to assist\
      \ others with similar\ndisorders and/or life experiences. Tasks and\nresponsibilities\
      \ may include leading a peer\nsupport group; modeling effective coping,\nhelp-seeking,\
      \ and self-care strategies; helping\nclients practice new skills or monitor\
      \ progress;\npromoting positive self-image to combat cli­\nents’ potentially\
      \ negative feelings about them­\nselves and the discrimination they may\nperceive\

      \ as possible. \nFamiliarize the Client With \nTrauma-Informed Services \nWithout\
      \ thinking too much about it, you\nprobably know the purpose of an intake pro­\n\
      cess, the correct way to complete a screening\ndevice, the meaning of a lot\
      \ of the jargon spe­\ncific to behavioral health, and your program’s \nexpectations\
      \ for client participation; in fact, \nmaybe you’re already involved in facilitating\n\

      \ Perspective \nautomatic for you. This can make it easy to\nforget that nearly\
      \ everything clients and their\nfamilies encounter in seeking behavioral\nhealth\
      \ assistance is new to them. Thus, intro­\nducing clients to program services,\
      \ activities,\nand interventions in a manner that expects\nthem to be unfamiliar\
      \ with these processes is \nessential, regardless of their clinical and treat­\n\
      ment history. Beyond addressing the unfamili­\narity of services, educating\
      \ clients about each \nprocess—from first contact all the way \nthrough recovery\
      \ services—gives them a\nchance to participate actively and make in­\nformed\
      \ decisions across the continuum of care. \nFamiliarizing clients with trauma-informed\
      \ \nservices extends beyond explaining program \nservices or treatment processes;\
      \ it involves \nexplaining the value and type of trauma-\nrelated questions\
      \ that may be asked during an\nintake process, educating clients about trauma\
      \ \nto help normalize traumatic stress reactions, \nand discussing trauma-specific\
      \ interventions \nand other available services (including expla­\nnations of\
      \ treatment methodologies and of the\nrationale behind specific interventions).\
      \ De­\nvelopmentally appropriate psychoeducation\nabout trauma-informed services\
      \ allows clients \nto be informed participants. \nIncorporate Universal Routine\
      \ \nScreenings for Trauma \nScreening universally for client histories, expe­\n\
      riences, and symptoms of trauma at intake can \nbenefit clients and providers.\
      \ Most providers\nknow that clients can be affected by trauma,\nbut universal\
      \ screening provides a steady re­\nminder to be watchful for past traumatic\
      \ expe­\nriences and their potential influence upon a\nclient’s interactions\
      \ and engagement with ser­\nvices across the continuum of care. Screening\n\
      should guide treatment planning; it alerts the\nstaff to potential issues and\
      \ serves as a valuable \ntool to increase clients’ awareness of the possi­\n\
      ble impact of trauma and the importance of\naddressing related issues during\
      \ treatment. \nNonetheless, screenings are only as useful as \nthe guidelines\
      \ and processes established to\naddress positive screens (which occur when\n\
      clients respond to screening questions in a way \nthat signifies possible trauma-related\
      \ symp­\ntoms or histories). Staff should be trained to\nuse screening tools\
      \ consistently so that all cli­\nents are screened in the same way. Staff mem­\n\
      bers also need to know how to score \nscreenings and when specific variables\
      \ (e.g.,\nrace/ethnicity, native language, gender, culture)\nmay influence screening\
      \ results. For example, a\nwoman who has been sexually assaulted by a\nman may\
      \ be wary of responding to questions if\na male staff member or interpreter\
      \ administers \nthe screening or provides translation services.\nLikewise, a\
      \ person in a current abusive or vio­\nlent relationship may not acknowledge\
      \ the \ninterpersonal violence in fear of retaliation or \nas a result of disconnection\
      \ or denial of his or \nher experience, and he or she may have diffi­\nculty\
      \ in processing and then living between \ntwo worlds—what is acknowledged in\
      \ treat­\nment versus what is experienced at home. \nIn addition, staff training\
      \ on using trauma-\nrelated screening tools needs to center on how \nand when\
      \ to gather relevant information after\nthe screening is complete. Organizational\
      \ pol­\nicies and procedures should guide staff mem­\nbers on how to respond\
      \ to a positive screening,\nsuch as by making a referral for an indepth\nassessment\
      \ of traumatic stress, providing the \nclient with an introductory psychoeducational\
      \ \nsession on the typical biopsychosocial effects \nof trauma, and/or coordinating\
      \ care so that the\nclient gains access to trauma-specific services \nthat meet\
      \ his or her needs. Screening tool se­\nlection is an important ingredient in\
      \ incorpo­\nrating routine, universal screening practices \ninto behavioral\
      \ health services. Many screen­\ning tools are available, yet they differ in\
      \ format \n25\n\n[Page 48]\nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \nand in how they present questions. Select tools\nbased not just on sound\
      \ test properties, but\nalso according to whether they encompass a\nbroad range\
      \ of experiences typically consid­\nered traumatic and are flexible enough to\
      \ al­\nlow for an individual’s own interpretation of\ntraumatic events. For\
      \ more information on \nscreening and assessment of trauma and trau­\nma-related\
      \ symptoms and effects, see Chapter\n4, “Screening and Assessment,” in this\
      \ TIP. \nView Trauma Through a \nSociocultural Lens \nTo understand how trauma\
      \ affects an individ­\nual, family, or community, you must first un­\nderstand\
      \ life experiences and cultural \nbackground as key contextual elements for\
      \ \nthat trauma. As demonstrated in Exhibit 1.1­\n2, many factors shape traumatic\
      \ experiences \nand individual and community responses to it;\none of the most\
      \ significant factors is culture. It\ninfluences the interpretation and meaning\
      \ of\ntraumatic events, individual beliefs regarding\npersonal responsibility\
      \ for the trauma and\nsubsequent responses, and the meaning and\nacceptability\
      \ of symptoms, support, and help-\nseeking behaviors. As this TIP proceeds to\n\
      describe the differences among cultures per­\ntaining to trauma, remember that\
      \ there are\nnumerous cross-cutting factors that can direct­\nly or indirectly\
      \ influence the attitudes, beliefs,\nbehaviors, resources, and opportunities\
      \ within\na given culture, subculture, or racial and/or\nethnic group (Exhibit\
      \ 1.1-4). For an indepth \nExhibit 1.1-4: Cross-Cutting Factors of Culture \n\

      Culture and Trauma \n• \nSome populations and cultures are more likely than\
      \ others to experience a traumatic event or a \nspecific type of trauma. \n\
      • \nRates of traumatic stress are high across all diverse populations and cultures\
      \ that face military \naction and political violence. \n• \nCulture influences\
      \ not only whether certain events are perceived as traumatic, but also how an\
      \ \nindividual interprets and assigns meaning to the trauma. \n• \nSome traumas\
      \ may have greater impact on a given culture because those traumas represent\
      \ \nsomething significant for that culture or disrupt cultural practices or\
      \ ways of life.  \n• \nCulture determines acceptable responses to trauma and\
      \ shapes the expression of distress. It \nsignificantly influences how people\
      \ convey traumatic stress through behavior, emotions, and \nthinking immediately\
      \ following a trauma and well after the traumatic experience has ceased.  \n\
      • \nTraumatic stress symptoms vary according to the type of trauma within the\
      \ culture. \n• \nCulture affects what qualifies as a legitimate health concern\
      \ and which symptoms warrant help.  \n• \nIn addition to shaping beliefs about\
      \ acceptable forms of help-seeking behavior and healing prac­\ntices, culture\
      \ can provide a source of strength, unique coping strategies, and specific resources.\

      \ and accrediting bodies build\nculturally responsive practices into their cur­\n\
      ricula, standards, policies and procedures, and \ncredentialing processes. The\
      \ implementation\nof culturally responsive practices will further\nguide the\
      \ treatment planning process so that\ntrauma-informed services are more appropri­\n\

      \ Resilience \nFostering individual strengths is a key step in\nprevention when\
      \ working with people who\nhave been exposed to trauma. It is also an es­\n\
      sential intervention strategy—one that builds \non the individual’s existing\

      \ can begin to explore the \nrole of trauma in their lives; such services can\n\
      also help determine how best to address and\ntailor interventions to meet their\
      \ needs. Pre­\nvention, mental health, and substance abuse\ntreatment services\
      \ should include teaching\nclients about how trauma can affect their lives;\n\
      these services should also focus on developing\nself-care skills, coping strategies,\
      \ supportive \nnetworks, and a sense of competence. Building\ntrauma-resistant\
      \ skills begins with normaliz­\ning the symptoms of traumatic stress and \n\
      helping clients who have experienced trauma\nconnect the dots between current\
      \ problems \nand past trauma when appropriate. \nNevertheless, TIC and trauma-specific\
      \ inter­\nventions that focus on skill-building should\nnot do so at the expense\
      \ of acknowledging\nindividual strengths, creativity in adapting to\ntrauma,\
      \ and inherent attributes and tools cli­\nents possesses to combat the effects\
      \ of trauma.\nSome theoretical models that use skill-\nbuilding strategies base\
      \ the value of this ap­\nproach on a deficit perspective; they assume \nthat\
      \ some individuals lack the necessary tools \nto manage specific situations\
      \ and, because of\nthis deficiency, they encounter problems that\nothers with\
      \ effective skills would not experi­\nence. This type of perspective further\
      \ assumes \nthat, to recover, these individuals must learn\nnew coping skills\
      \ and behavior. TIC, on the\nother hand, makes the assumption that clients \n\

      \ \nsurface. The impact first creates the largest \nwave, which is followed\
      \ by ever-expanding, but \nless intense, ripples. Likewise, the influence of\
      \ \na given trauma can be broad, but generally, its \neffects are less intense\
      \ for individuals further \nremoved from the trauma; eventually, its im­\npact\
      \ dissipates all around. For trauma survivors, \nthe impact of trauma can be\
      \ far-reaching and \ncan affect life areas and relationships long after \nthe\
      \ trauma occurred. This analogy can also \nbroadly describe the recovery process\
      \ for indi­\nviduals who have experienced trauma and for \nthose who have the\
      \ privilege of hearing their \nstories. As survivors reveal their tra\n \numa-related\
      \ \nexperiences and struggles to a counselor or \nanother caregiver, the trauma\
      \ becomes a \nshared experience, although it is not likely to \nbe as intense\
      \ for the caregiver as it was for the \nindividual who experienced the trauma.\
      \ The \ncaregiver may hold onto the trauma’s known \nand unknown effects or\
      \ may consciously decide \nto engage in behaviors that provide support to \n\
      further dissipate the impact of this trauma and \nthe risk of secondary trauma.\
      \ \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nand effects from providing\
      \ services focused\non trauma or listening to clients recount\ntraumatic experiences.\
      \ So too, when a coun­\nselor has a history of personal trauma, work­\ning with\
      \ trauma survivors may evoke \nmemories of the counselor’s own trauma his­\n\
      tory, which may increase the potential for \nsecondary traumatization. \nThe\
      \ range of reactions that manifest with sec­\nondary trauma can be, but are\
      \ not necessarily,\nsimilar to the reactions presented by clients \nwho have\
      \ experienced primary trauma. Symp­\ntoms of secondary trauma can produce varying\n\
      levels of difficulty, impairment, or distress in\ndaily functioning; these may\
      \ or may not meet\ndiagnostic thresholds for acute stress, post-\ntraumatic\
      \ stress, or adjustment, anxiety, or \nmood disorders (Bober & Regehr, 2006).\n\
      Symptoms may include physical or psycholog­\nical reactions to traumatic memories\
      \ clients \nhave shared; avoidance behaviors during client\ninteractions or\
      \ when recalling emotional con­\ntent in supervision; numbness, limited emo­\n\
      tional expression, or diminished affect; somatic\ncomplaints; heightened arousal,\
      \ including in­\nsomnia; negative thinking or depressed mood;\nand detachment\
      \ from family, friends, and oth­\ner supports (Maschi & Brown, 2010). \nWorking\
      \ daily with individuals who have been\ntraumatized can be a burden for counselors\
      \ \nand other behavioral health service providers, \nbut all too often, they\
      \ blame the symptoms \nresulting from that burden on other stressors \nat work\
      \ or at home. Only in the past 2 decades\nhave literature and trainings begun\
      \ paying\nattention to secondary trauma or compassion\nfatigue; even so, agencies\
      \ often do not trans­\nlate this knowledge into routine prevention\npractices.\
      \ Counselors and other staff members \nmay find it difficult to engage in activities\
      \ that\ncould ward off secondary trauma due to time \nconstraints, workload,\
      \ lack of agency re­\nsources, and/or an organizational culture that \ndisapproves\
      \ of help-seeking or provides inade­\nquate staff support. The demands of providing\n\
      care to trauma survivors cannot be ignored,\nlest the provider become increasingly\
      \ impaired\nand less effective. Counselors with \nunacknowledged secondary trauma\
      \ can cause \nharm to clients via poorly enforced bounda­\nries, missed appointments,\
      \ or even abandon­\nment of clients and their needs (Pearlman &\nSaakvitne,\
      \ 1995). \nEssential components of TIC include organi­\nzational and personal\
      \ strategies to address \nThe Impact of Trauma \n30"

      \ In\nagencies and among individual providers, it is\nkey for the culture to\
      \ promote acceptability,\naccessibility, and accountability in seeking\nhelp,\
      \ accessing support and supervision, and\nengaging in self-care behaviors in\
      \ and outside\nof the agency or office. Agencies should in­\nvolve staff members\
      \ who work with trauma in \ndeveloping informal and formal agency prac­\ntices\
      \ and procedures to prevent or address sec­\nondary trauma. Even though a number\
      \ of\ncommunity-based agencies face fiscal con­\nstraints, prevention strategies\
      \ for secondary \ntrauma can be intertwined with the current \ninfrastructure\
      \ (e.g., staff meetings, education,\ncase consultations and group case discussions,\n\

      \ Is \nit the total absence of symptoms or conse­\nquences? Does it mean that\
      \ clients stop hav­\ning nightmares or being reminded, by cues, of\npast trauma?\
      \ When clients who have experi­\nenced trauma enter into a helping relationship\
      \ \nto address trauma specifically, they are often\nlooking for a cure, a remission\
      \ of symptoms, or\nrelief from the pain as quickly as possible. \nHowever, they\
      \ often possess a history of un­\npredictable symptoms and symptom intensity\
      \ \nthat reinforces an underlying belief that recov­\nery is not possible. On\
      \ one hand, clients are\nlooking for a message that they can be cured,\nwhile\

      \ Projecting hope \nand reinforcing the belief that recovery is pos­\nsible\
      \ extends well beyond the practice of es­\ntablishing safety; it also encompasses\
      \ \ndiscussing what recovery means and how it\nlooks to clients, as well as\
      \ identifying how\nthey will know that they’ve entered into recov­\nery in earnest.\
      \ \nProviding hope involves projecting an attitude\nthat recovery is possible.\
      \ This attitude also\ninvolves viewing clients as competent to make \nchanges\
      \ that will allow them to deal with\ntrauma-related challenges, providing opportu­\n\
      nities for them to practice dealing with diffi­\ncult situations, and normalizing\
      \ discomfort or\ndifficult emotions and framing these as man­\nageable rather\
      \ than dangerous. If you convey \nthis attitude consistently to your clients,\
      \ they \nwill begin to understand that discomfort is not \na signal to avoid,\
      \ but a sign to engage—and\nthat behavioral, cognitive, and emotional re­\n\
      sponses to cues associated with previous trau­\nmas are a normal part of the\
      \ recovery process.\nIt’s not the absence of responses to such trig­\ngers that\
      \ mark recovery, but rather, how clients \nexperience and manage those responses.\
      \ Cli­\nents can also benefit from interacting with\nothers who are further\
      \ along in their recovery \nfrom trauma. Time spent with peer support\nstaff\
      \ or sharing stories with other trauma sur­\nvivors who are well on their way\
      \ to recovery is\ninvaluable—it sends a powerful message that \nrecovery is\
      \ achievable, that there is no shame \nin being a trauma survivor, and that\
      \ there is a \nfuture beyond the trauma. \nAs You Proceed \nThis chapter has\
      \ established the foundation\nand rationale of this TIP, reviewed trauma-\n\
      informed concepts and terminology, and pro­\nvided an overview of TIC principles\
      \ and a \nguiding framework for this text. As you pro­\nceed, be aware of the\
      \ wide-ranging responses \nto trauma that occur not only across racially \n\
      and ethnically diverse groups but also within\nspecific communities, families,\
      \ and individuals.\nCounselors, prevention specialists, other be­\nhavioral\
      \ health workers, supervisors, and or­\nganizations all need to develop skills\
      \ to create \nan environment that is responsive to the\nunique attributes and\
      \ experiences of each cli­\nent. As you read this TIP, remember that\nmany cross-cutting\
      \ factors influence the expe­\nriences, help-seeking behaviors, intervention\
      \ \nresponses, and outcomes of individuals, fami­\nlies, and populations who\
      \ have survived trau­\nma. Single, multiple, or chronic exposures to\ntraumatic\
      \ events, as well as the emotional,\ncognitive, behavioral, and spiritual responses\
      \ to\ntrauma, need to be understood within a social-\necological framework that\
      \ recognizes the \nmany ingredients prior to, during, and after \ntraumatic\
      \ experiences that set the stage for \nrecovery. \n32\n\n[Page 55]\nIN THIS\
      \ CHAPTER \n• Types of Trauma \n• Characteristics of Trauma \n• Individual and\
      \ \nSociocultural Features\n Trauma Awareness\n2 \nTraumatic experiences typically\
      \ do not result in long-term im­\npairment for most individuals. It is normal\
      \ to experience such\nevents across the lifespan; often, individuals, families,\
      \ and com­\nmunities respond to them with resilience. This chapter explores\
      \ \nseveral main elements that influence why people respond differ­\nently to\
      \ trauma. Using the social-ecological model outlined in\nPart 1, Chapter 1,\
      \ this chapter explores some of the contextual \nand systemic dynamics that\
      \ influence individual and community \nperceptions of trauma and its impact.\
      \ The three main foci are:\ntypes of trauma, objective and subjective characteristics\
      \ of trauma,\nand individual and sociocultural features that serve as risk or\
      \ pro­\ntective factors. \nThis chapter’s main objective is to highlight the\
      \ key characteris­\ntics of traumatic experiences. Trauma-informed behavioral\
      \ health\nservice providers understand that many influences shape the ef­\n\
      fects of trauma among individuals and communities—it is not \njust the event\
      \ that determines the outcome, but also the event’s \ncontext and the resultant\
      \ interactions across systems. \nTypes of Trauma \nThe following section reviews\
      \ various forms and types of trauma.\nIt does not cover every conceivable trauma\
      \ that an individual,\ngroup, or community may encounter. Specific traumas are\
      \ re­\nviewed only once, even when they could fit in multiple categories \n\
      of trauma. Additionally, the order of appearance does not denote \na specific\
      \ trauma’s importance or prevalence, and there is no lack\nof relevance implied\
      \ if a given trauma is not specifically addressed\nin this Treatment Improvement\
      \ Protocol (TIP). The intent is to\ngive a broad perspective of the various\
      \ categories and types of\ntrauma to behavioral health workers who wish to be\
      \ trauma in­\nformed. \n33"

      TIC Framework in Behavioral Health Services—Trauma Awareness \nNatural or Human-Caused\
      \ \nTraumas \nThe classification of a trauma as natural or \ncaused by humans\
      \ can have a significant im­\npact on the ways people react to it and on the\
      \ \ntypes of assistance mobilized in its aftermath\n(see Exhibit 1.2-1 for trauma\
      \ examples). Nat­\nural traumatic experiences can directly affect a\nsmall number\
      \ of people, such as a tree falling\non a car during a rainstorm, or many people\
      \ \nand communities, as with a hurricane. Natural \nevents, often referred to\
      \ as “acts of God,” are\ntypically unavoidable. Human-caused traumas \nare caused\
      \ by human failure (e.g., technologi­\ncal catastrophes, accidents, malevolence)\
      \ or by\nhuman design (e.g., war). Although multiple \nfactors contribute to\
      \ the severity of a natural \nor human-caused trauma, traumas perceived\nas\
      \ intentionally harmful often make the event\nmore traumatic for people and\
      \ communities. \n34\n\n[Page 57]\nPart 1, Chapter 2—Trauma Awareness \nExhibit\

      Bank robbery \nGenocide \nMedical or food tampering \nHow survivors of natural\
      \ trauma respond to\nthe experience often depends on the degree of\ndevastation,\
      \ the extent of individual and\ncommunity losses, and the amount of time it\n\
      takes to reestablish daily routines, activities,\nand services (e.g., returning\
      \ to school or work,\nbeing able to do laundry, having products to\nbuy in a\
      \ local store). The amount, accessibil­\nity, and duration of relief services\
      \ can signifi­\ncantly influence the duration of traumatic\nstress reactions\
      \ as well as the recovery process. \nAlongside the disruption of daily routines,\
      \ the\npresence of community members or outsiders \nin affected areas may add\
      \ significant stress or\ncreate traumatic experiences in and of them­\nselves.\
      \ Examples include the threat of others \nstealing what remains of personal\
      \ property, \nrestrictions on travel or access to property or \nliving quarters,\
      \ disruption of privacy within\nshelters, media attention, and subsequent ex­\n\
      posure to repetitive images reflecting the dev­\nastation. Therefore, it isn’t\
      \ just the natural \ndisaster or event that can challenge an indi­\nvidual or\
      \ community; often, the consequences \nof the event and behavioral responses\
      \ from \nothers within and outside the community play \na role in pushing survivors\
      \ away from effective \ncoping or toward resilience and recovery. \nHuman-caused\
      \ traumas are fundamentally\ndifferent from natural disasters. They are ei­\n\
      ther intentional, such as a convenience store \nrobbery at gunpoint, or unintentional,\
      \ such as \nthe technological accident of a bridge collapse \n(as occurred in\
      \ Minneapolis, Minnesota, in \n2007; U.S. Fire Administration, 2007). The\n\
      subsequent reactions to these traumas often\ndepend on their intentionality.\
      \ However, a\nperson or group of people is typically the tar­\nget of the survivors’\
      \ anger and blame. Survi­\nvors of an unintentionally human-caused \ntraumatic\
      \ event may feel angry and frustrated\nbecause of the lack of protection or\
      \ care of­\nfered by the responsible party or government,\nparticularly if there\
      \ has been a perceived act of \nomission. After intentional human-caused \n\
      acts, survivors often struggle to understand the \n35"

      \ Greensburg’s Tornado  \nQuecreek Mine Flood \nThe year following the rescue\
      \ of nine miners from the Quecreek mine in western Pennsylvania in \n2002 was\
      \ a difficult one for residents of Somerset County. The dazzle of publicity\
      \ surrounding a \nhandful of workers from a small town, tension between miners\
      \ and rescuers, and animosity over \nmoney for movie and book deals, in addition\
      \ to the trauma itself, resulted in a rescuer’s suicide, a \nnumber of miners\
      \ having trauma-related symptoms, and several rescuers needing to seek treatment\
      \ \nfor posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Goodell, 2003). \nGreensburg’s\
      \ Tornado \nGreensburg, a small town in southern Kansas, was hit by a large\
      \ tornado in 2007 that killed 11 resi­\ndents and leveled 95 percent of the\
      \ town while causing severe damage to the remaining 5 percent. \nFamilies and\
      \ community members experienced significant grief and traumatic stress after\
      \ the disas­\nter. Yet today, Greensburg is rebuilding with a focus on being\
      \ “green”—that is, environmentally \nresponsible—from design to construction\
      \ and all the way through demolition. This town has the \nhighest number of\
      \ Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design–certified buildings in the world.\
      \ A \nreality television show about the town’s reinvention ran for three seasons,\

      \ Group, Community, \nand Mass Traumas \nIn recognizing the role of trauma and\
      \ under­\nstanding responses to it, consider whether the \ntrauma primarily\
      \ affected an individual and \nperhaps his or her family (e.g., automobile \n\
      accident, sexual or physical assault, severe ill­\nness); occurred within the\
      \ context of a group\n(e.g., trauma experienced by first responders \nor those\
      \ who have seen military combat) or\ncommunity (e.g., gang-related shootings);\
      \ \ntranspired within a certain culture; or was a\nlarge-scale disaster (e.g.,\
      \ hurricane, terrorist\nattack). This context can have significant im­\nplications\
      \ for whether (and how) people expe­\nrience shame as a result of the trauma,\
      \ the \nkinds of support and compassion they receive,\nwhether their experiences\
      \ are normalized or\ndiminished by others, and even the kinds of\nservices they\
      \ are offered to help them recover\nand cope. \nIndividual trauma \nAn individual\
      \ trauma refers to an event that \nonly occurs to one person. It can be a single\
      \ \nevent (e.g., mugging, rape, physical attack,\nwork-related physical injury)\
      \ or multiple or\nprolonged events (e.g., a life-threatening ill­\nness, multiple\
      \ sexual assaults). Although the \ntrauma directly affects just one individual,\n\
      others who know the person and/or are aware \nof the trauma will likely experience\
      \ emotional \nrepercussions from the event(s) as well, such\nas recounting what\
      \ they said to the person\nbefore the event, reacting in disbelief, or\nthinking\
      \ that it could just as easily have hap­\npened to them, too. \nSurvivors of\

      of their experiences. Often, shame distorts \ntheir perception of responsibility\
      \ for the trau­\nma. Some survivors of individual traumas,\nespecially those\

      \ Who Have Experienced Individual \nTraumas  \nIn working with clients who have\
      \ histories of individual trauma, counselors should consider that: \n• \nEmpathy,\
      \ or putting oneself in the shoes of another, is more potent than sympathy (expressing\
      \ a \nfeeling of sorrow for another person). \n• \nSome clients need to briefly\
      \ describe the trauma(s) they have experienced, particularly in the \nearly\
      \ stages of recovery. Strategies that focus on reexperiencing the trauma, retrieving\
      \ feelings \nrelated to the trauma, and bringing past experiences to the forefront\
      \ should only be implement­\ned if trauma-specific treatment planning and services\
      \ are available. \n• \nUnderstanding the trauma, especially in early recovery,\
      \ should begin with educating the client \nabout and normalizing trauma-related\
      \ symptoms, creating a sense of safety within the treatment \nenvironment, and\
      \ addressing how trauma symptoms may interfere with the client’s life in the\
      \ \npresent. \n• \nIt is helpful to examine how the trauma affects opportunities\
      \ to receive substance abuse and/or \nmental health treatment as well as treatment\
      \ for and recovery from the trauma itself (e.g., by lim­\niting one’s willingness\
      \ to share in or participate in group counseling). \n \nIdentifying and exploring\
      \ strengths in the client’s history can help the client apply those strengths\
      \ \nto his or her ability to function in the present. \nAcute stress disorder\
      \ (ASD) prevalence \namong patients at medical trauma centers \nis very high,\
      \ making trauma -related disor­\nders some of the most common complica­\ntions\
      \ seen in physically injured patients. \nClients who have sustained serious\
      \ injuries \nin car crashes, fires, stabbings, shootings, \nfalls, and other\
      \ events have an increased \nlikelihood of developing trauma -related \nmental\
      \ disorders. Research suggests that \nPTSD and/or problem drinking is evident\
      \ \nin nearly 50 percent of patients 1 year \nafter discharge from trauma surgical\
      \ units. \n(Zatzick, Jurkovich, Gentilello, Wisner, & \nRivara, 2002) \nPart\
      \ 1, Chapter 2—Trauma Awareness \nacceptance from others; they are also are\
      \ more \nlikely to struggle with issues of causation (e.g.,\na young woman may\
      \ feel unduly responsible \nfor a sexual assault), to feel isolated by the \n\
      trauma, and to experience repeated trauma\nthat makes them feel victimized.\
      \ \nPhysical injuries \nPhysical injuries are among the most prevalent\nindividual\
      \ traumas. Millions of emergency \nroom (ER) visits each year relate directly\
      \ to\nphysical injuries. Most trauma patients are \nrelatively young; about\
      \ 70 percent of injury-\nrelated ER cases are people younger than 45\nyears\
      \ old (McCaig & Burt, 2005). Dedicated \nER hospital units, known as “trauma\
      \ centers,”\nspecialize in physical traumas such as gunshot\nwounds, stabbings,\
      \ and other immediate phys­\nical injuries. The term “trauma” in relation to\n\
      ERs does not refer to psychological trauma,\nwhich is the focus of this TIP,\
      \ yet physical \ninjuries can be associated with psychological \ntrauma. Sudden,\
      \ unexpected, adverse health-\nrelated events can lead to extensive psycholog­\n\
      ical trauma for patients and their families. \nExcessive alcohol use is the\
      \ leading risk factor\nfor physical injuries; it’s also the most promis­\ning\
      \ target for injury prevention. Studies con­\nsistently connect injuries and\
      \ substance use \n(Gentilello, Ebel, Wickizer, Salkever, &\nRivara, 2005); nearly\
      \ 50 percent of patients\nadmitted to trauma centers have injuries at­\ntributable\
      \ to alcohol abuse and dependence \n(Gentilello et al., 1999). One study found\
      \ that\ntwo thirds of ambulatory assault victims pre­\nsenting to an ER had\
      \ positive substance use \nurinalysis results; more than half of all victims\
      \ \nhad PTSD 3 months later (Roy-Byrne et al., \n37"

      \ problematic during\nan ER visit for a physical injury will have a \nnew injury\
      \ within 1 year (Gentilello et al.,\n2005). For further information, see TIP\
      \ 16,\nAlcohol and Other Drug Screening of Hospital­\nized Trauma Patients (Center\
      \ for Substance \nAbuse Treatment [CSAT], 1995a). \nGroup trauma \nThe term\
      \ “group trauma” refers to traumatic\nexperiences that affect a particular group\
      \ of\npeople. This TIP intentionally distinguishes \ngroup trauma from mass\
      \ trauma to highlight \nthe unique experiences and characteristics of\ntrauma-related\
      \ reactions among small groups.\nThese groups often share a common identity\
      \ \nand history, as well as similar activities and\nconcerns. They include vocational\
      \ groups who\nspecialize in managing traumas or who rou­\ntinely place themselves\
      \ in harm’s way—for\nexample, first responders, a group including\npolice and\
      \ emergency medical personnel.\nSome examples of group trauma include crews\
      \ \nand their families who lose members from a \ncommercial fishing accident,\
      \ a gang whose\nmembers experience multiple deaths and inju­\nries, teams of\
      \ firefighters who lose members in\na roof collapse, responders who attempt\
      \ to\nsave flood victims, and military service mem­\nbers in a specific theater\
      \ of operation. \nSurvivors of group trauma can have different\nexperiences\
      \ and responses than survivors of\nindividual or mass traumas. Survivors of\
      \ group\ntrauma, such as military service members and\nfirst responders, are\
      \ likely to experience re­\npeated trauma. They tend to keep the trauma\nexperiences\
      \ within the group, feeling that oth­\ners outside the group will not understand;\n\
      group outsiders are generally viewed as intrud­\ners. Members may encourage\
      \ others in the\ngroup to shut down emotionally and repress \ntheir traumatic\
      \ experiences—and there are\nsome occupational roles that necessitate the \n\
      repression of reactions to complete a mission\nor to be attentive to the needs\
      \ at hand. Group\nmembers may not want to seek help and may \ndiscourage others\
      \ from doing so out of fear\nthat it may shame the entire group. In this\nenvironment,\
      \ members may see it as a viola­\ntion of group confidentiality when a member\n\
      seeks assistance outside the group, such as by \ngoing to a counselor. \nGroup\
      \ members who have had traumatic\nexperiences in the past may not actively sup­\n\
      port traumatized colleagues for fear that ac­\nknowledging the trauma will increase\
      \ the risk \nof repressed trauma-related emotions surfac­\ning. However, groups\
      \ with adequate resources \nfor helping group members can develop a\nstronger\
      \ and more supportive environment\nfor handling subsequent traumas. These main\n\
      group features influence the course of short-\nand long-term adjustments, including\
      \ the \ndevelopment of traumatic stress symptoms \nassociated with mental and\
      \ substance use \ndisorders. \nCertain occupational groups are at greater risk\
      \ \nof experiencing trauma—particularly multiple \ntraumas. This TIP briefly\
      \ reviews two main\ngroups as examples in the following sections:\nfirst responders\
      \ and military service members.\nFor more detailed information on the impact\n\
      of trauma and deployment, refer to the\nplanned TIP, Reintegration-Related Behavioral\
      \ \nHealth Issues in Veterans and Military Families \n(SAMHSA, planned f). \n\
      First responders \nFirst responders are usually emergency medi­\ncal technicians,\
      \ disaster management person­\nnel, police officers, rescue workers, medical\
      \ \nand behavioral health professionals, journalists,\nand volunteers from various\
      \ backgrounds.\nThey also include lifeguards, military person­\nnel, and clergy.\

      \ with\ntraumatic stress. Some stressors that military \nservice members may\
      \ encounter include work­\ning while physically exhausted, exposure to\ngunfire,\
      \ seeing or knowing someone who has \nbeen injured or killed, traveling in areas\
      \ \nknown for roadside bombs and rockets, ex­\ntended hypervigilance, fear of\
      \ being struck by \nan improvised explosive device, and so forth. \nTrauma affecting\
      \ communities and \ncultures \nTrauma that affects communities and cultures\
      \ \ncovers a broad range of violence and atrocities\nthat erode the sense of\
      \ safety within a given\ncommunity, including neighborhoods,\nschools, towns,\
      \ and reservations. It may in­\nvolve violence in the form of physical or sexual\
      \ \nassaults, hate crimes, robberies, workplace or\ngang-related violence, threats,\
      \ shootings, or\nstabbings—for example, the school shooting\nat Virginia Polytechnic\
      \ Institute and State\nUniversity in 2007. It also includes actions \nthat attempt\
      \ to dismantle systemic cultural \npractices, resources, and identities, such\
      \ as \nmaking boarding school attendance mandato­\nry for Native American children\
      \ or placing\nthem in non-Native foster homes. Cultural \nand/or community-based\
      \ trauma can also oc­\ncur via indifference or limited responsiveness \nto specific\
      \ communities or cultures that are \nfacing a potential catastrophe. Cultural\
      \ trau­\nmas are events that, whether intentionally or\nnot, erode the heritage\
      \ of a culture—as with \nprejudice, disenfranchisement, and health\ninequities\
      \ (e.g., late prenatal care, inability to\nafford medications, limited access\
      \ to culturally \nappropriate health education, vicinity and\nquality of affordable\
      \ medical services), among\nother examples. \n39"

      \ \nHistorical trauma \nHistorical trauma, known also as generational \ntrauma,\
      \ refers to events that are so widespread\nas to affect an entire culture; such\
      \ events also\nhave effects intense enough to influence gen­\nerations of the\
      \ culture beyond those who ex­\nperienced them directly. The enslavement,\n\
      torture, and lynching of African Americans;\nthe forced assimilation and relocation\
      \ of \nAmerican Indians onto reservations; the ex­\ntermination of millions\
      \ of Jews and others in \nEurope during World War II; and the geno­\ncidal policies\
      \ of the Hutus in Rwanda and the\nKhmer Rouge in Cambodia are examples of\n\
      historical trauma. \nIn the past 50 years, research has explored the \ngenerational\
      \ effects of the Holocaust upon\nsurvivors and their families. More recent liter­\n\
      ature has extended the concept of historical or\ngenerational trauma to the\
      \ traumatic experi­\nences of Native Americans. Reduced popula­\ntion, forced\
      \ relocation, and acculturation are\nsome examples of traumatic experiences\
      \ that \nNative people have endured across centuries,\nbeginning with the first\
      \ European presence in\nthe Americas. These tragic experiences have \nled to\
      \ significant loss of cultural identity across\ngenerations and have had a significant\
      \ impact\non the well-being of Native communities \n(Whitbeck, Chen, Hoyt, &\
      \ Adams, 2004).\nData are limited on the association of mental \nand substance\
      \ use disorders with historical \ntrauma among Native people, but literature\
      \ \nsuggests that historical trauma has repercus­\nsions across generations,\
      \ such as depression,\ngrief, traumatic stress, domestic violence, and\nsubstance\
      \ abuse, as well as significant loss of\ncultural knowledge, language, and identity\
      \ \n(Gone, 2009). Historical trauma can increase \nthe vulnerability of multiple\
      \ generations to the\neffects of traumas that occur in their own \nlifetimes.\
      \ \nMass trauma \nMass traumas or disasters affect large numbers \nof people\
      \ either directly or indirectly. It is be­\nyond the scope of this TIP to cover\
      \ any specif­\nic disaster in detail; note, however, that mass \ntraumas include\
      \ large-scale natural and\nhuman-caused disasters (including intentional \n\
      acts and accidents alike). Mass traumas may \ninvolve significant loss of property\
      \ and lives as \nwell as the widespread disruption of normal \nroutines and\
      \ services. Responding to such\ntraumas often requires immediate and exten­\n\
      sive resources that typically exceed the capaci­\nty of the affected communities,\
      \ States, or\ncountries in which they occur. Recent exam­\nples of such large-scale\
      \ catastrophes include:\n•  In January 2010, a massive earthquake hit\nHaiti,\
      \ killing hundreds of thousands of\npeople and leaving over a million homeless.\
      \ \n•  A nuclear reactor meltdown in the Ukraine \nin 1986 resulted in a technological\
      \ and en­\nvironmental disaster that affected tens of \nmillions of people.\
      \ \n•  The tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2005 \nleft hundreds of thousands\
      \ dead in nine \ncountries. \nOne factor that influences an individual’s \n\
      response to trauma is his or her ability to\nprocess one trauma before another\
      \ trauma\noccurs. In mass traumas, the initial event\ncauses considerable destruction,\
      \ the conse­\nquences of which may spawn additional \ntraumas and other stressful\
      \ events that lead to \nmore difficulties and greater need for adjust­\nments\
      \ among survivors, first responders, and\ndisaster relief agencies. Often, a\
      \ chain reac­\ntion occurs. Take, for example, Hurricane \nKatrina and its impact\
      \ on the people of\nLouisiana and other coastal States. After the \ninitial\
      \ flooding, people struggled to obtain\nbasic needs, including food, drinking\
      \ water,\nsafe shelter, clothing, medicines, personal \nhygiene items, and so\
      \ forth, all as concern\nmounted about the safety of children and \n40"

      \ relatives, friends, and neighbors. In this\nand similar cases, the destruction\
      \ from the \ninitial flooding led to mass displacement of\nfamilies and communities;\
      \ many people had to\nrelocate far from New Orleans and other badly \naffected\
      \ areas, while also needing to gain fi­\nnancial assistance, reinitiate work\
      \ to generate \nincome, and obtain stable housing. People \ncould not assimilate\
      \ one stressor before anoth­\ner appeared. \nNevertheless, mass traumas can\
      \ create an im­\nmediate sense of commonality—many people \nare “in the same\
      \ boat,” thus removing much of\nthe isolation that can occur with other types\
      \ of\ntrauma. People can acknowledge their diffi­\nculties and receive support,\
      \ even from \nstrangers. It is easier to ask for help because \nblame is often\
      \ externalized; large-scale disas­\nters are often referred to as “acts of God”\
      \ or,\nin cases of terrorism and other intentional \nevents, as acts of “evil.”\
      \ Even so, survivors of\nmass trauma often encounter an initial rally of\nsupport\
      \ followed by quickly diminishing ser­\nvices and dwindling care. When the disaster\n\
      fades from the headlines, public attention and\nconcern are likely to decrease,\
      \ leaving survi­\nvors struggling to reestablish or reinvent their\nlives without\
      \ much outside acknowledgment. \nThe experience of mass trauma can lead to the\
      \ \ndevelopment of psychological symptoms and\nsubstance use at either a subclinical\
      \ or a diag­\nnostic level (refer to Part 3 of this TIP, availa­\nble online,\
      \ for more information highlighting\nthe relationship between trauma and behav­\n\
      ioral health problems). Likewise, one of the \ngreatest risks for traumatic\
      \ stress reactions \nafter a mass tragedy is the presence of preex­\nisting\
      \ mental and co-occurring disorders, and \nindividuals who are in early recovery\
      \ from \nsubstance use disorders are at greater risk for\nsuch reactions as\
      \ well. Nonetheless, people are \namazingly resilient, and most will not develop\n\
      long-term mental or substance use disorders \nafter an event; in fact, most\
      \ trauma-related\nsymptoms will resolve in a matter of months \n(Keane & Piwowarczyk,\
      \ 2006). \nInterpersonal Traumas \nInterpersonal traumas are events that occur\n\
      (and typically continue to reoccur) between\npeople who often know each other,\
      \ such as \nspouses or parents and their children. Exam­\nples include physical\
      \ and sexual abuse, sexual \nassault, domestic violence, and elder abuse. \n\
      Intimate partner violence \nIntimate partner violence (IPV), often re­\nferred\
      \ to as domestic violence, is a pattern of\nactual or threatened physical, sexual,\
      \ and/or\nemotional abuse. It differs from simple assault\nin that multiple\
      \ episodes often occur and the\nperpetrator is an intimate partner of the vic­\n\
      tim. Trauma associated with IPV is normally\nongoing. Incidents of this form\
      \ of violence are\nrarely isolated, and the client may still be in\ncontact\
      \ with and encountering abuse from the \nperpetrator while engaged in treatment.\
      \ \nIntimate partners include current and former\nspouses, boyfriends, and girlfriends.\
      \ The ma­\njority of all nonfatal acts of violence and inti­\nmate partner homicides\
      \ are committed against\nwomen; IPV accounts for over 20 percent of\nnonfatal\
      \ violence against women but only 3.6\npercent of that committed against men\n\
      (Catalano, 2012). Children are the hidden\ncasualties of IPV. They often witness\
      \ the as­\nsaults or threats directly, within earshot, or by \nbeing exposed\
      \ to the aftermath of the violence \n(e.g., seeing bruises and destruction of\
      \ proper­\nty, hearing the pleas for it to stop or the prom­\nises that it will\
      \ never happen again). \nSubstance abuse, particularly involving alco­\nhol,\
      \ is frequently associated with IPV. It is the \npresence of alcohol-related\
      \ problems in either\npartner, rather than the level of alcohol con­\nsumption\
      \ itself, that is the important factor. \n41"

      \ to his or her age, even though that adult can afford to give that care or\
      \ is offered help to \ngive that care. Neglect can mean not providing adequate\

      \ is not providing a child with medical or mental health treatment or is \n\
      not giving prescribed medicines the child needs. Neglect can also mean neglecting\
      \ the child’s educa­\ntion. Keeping a child from school or from special education\
      \ can be neglect. Neglect also includes \nexposing a child to dangerous environments\
      \ (e.g., exposure to domestic violence). It can mean poor \nsupervision for\
      \ a child, including putting the child in the care of someone incapable of caring\
      \ for chil­\ndren. It can mean abandoning a child or expelling him or her from\
      \ home. Lack of psychological care, \nincluding emotional support, attention,\

      \ have more tension and \ndisagreement within the relationship in gen­\neral,\
      \ which leads to aggression and violence.\nThe consumption of alcohol during\
      \ a dispute \nis likely to decrease inhibitions and increase \nimpulsivity,\
      \ thus creating an opportunity for\nan argument to escalate into a physical\
      \ alterca­\ntion. More information on domestic violence \nand its effects on\
      \ partners and families, as well \nas its connection with substance use and\
      \ \ntrauma-related disorders, is available in TIP\n25, Substance Abuse Treatment\
      \ and Domestic \nViolence (CSAT, 1997b), and from the Na­\ntional Online Resource\
      \ Center on Violence \nAgainst Women (http://www.vawnet.org/). \nDevelopmental\
      \ Traumas \nDevelopmental traumas include specific events \nor experiences that\
      \ occur within a given devel­\nopmental stage and influence later develop­\n\
      ment, adjustment, and physical and mental \nhealth. Often, these traumas are\
      \ related to\nadverse childhood experiences (ACEs), but\nthey can also result\
      \ from tragedies that occur\noutside an expected developmental or life \nstage\
      \ (e.g., a child dying before a parent, being\ndiagnosed with a life-threatening\
      \ illness as a\nyoung adult) or from events at any point in \nthe life cycle\
      \ that create significant loss and \nhave life-altering consequences (e.g.,\
      \ the \ndeath of a significant other in the later years\nthat leads to displacement\
      \ of the surviving\npartner). \nAdverse childhood experiences \nSome people\
      \ experience trauma at a young age \nthrough sexual, physical, or emotional\
      \ abuse \nand neglect. The Adverse Childhood Experi­\nences Study (Felitti et\
      \ al., 1998) examined the \neffects of several categories of ACEs on adult\n\
      health, including physical and emotional abuse;\nsexual abuse; a substance-dependent\
      \ parent; an\nincarcerated, mentally ill, or suicidal household\nmember; spousal\
      \ abuse between parents; and\ndivorce or separation that meant one parent\n\
      was absent during childhood. The National \nComorbidity Studies examined the\
      \ prevalence\nof trauma and defined childhood adversities as \nparental death,\
      \ parental divorce/separation,\nlife-threatening illness, or extreme economic\n\
      hardship in addition to the childhood experi­\nences included in the Adverse\
      \ Childhood \nExperiences Study (Green et al., 2010). \nACEs can negatively\
      \ affect a person’s well­\nbeing into adulthood. Whether or not these\nexperiences\
      \ occur simultaneously, are time-\nlimited, or recur, they set the stage for\
      \ in­\ncreased vulnerability to physical, mental, and\nsubstance use disorders\

      \ by taking away an individual’s personhood. To survive, victims have to give\
      \ up \ntheir sense of self and will. They become the person the torturer designs\
      \ or a nonperson, simply exist­\ning. Inevitably, the shame of the victim is\
      \ enormous, because the focus of torture is to humiliate and \ndegrade. As a\
      \ result, victims often seek to hide their trauma and significant parts of their\
      \ selfhood \nlong after torture has ended and freedom has been obtained. According\
      \ to Judith Herman, “the \nmethods of establishing control over another person\
      \ are based upon the systematic, repetitive inflic­\ntion of psychological trauma.\
      \ They are organized techniques of disempowerment and disconnection. \nMethods\
      \ of psychological control are designed to instill terror and helplessness and\
      \ to destroy the \nvictim’s sense of self in relation to others.” \nSource:\

      with major depression, suicidal thoughts,\nPTSD, and dissociative symptoms.\

      his or her heavy drinking, self-reported alco­\nhol dependence, and marrying\
      \ a person who is \nalcohol dependent is two to four times greater\nthan that\
      \ of a person with no ACEs (Dube,\nAnda, Felitti, Edwards, & Croft, 2002). \n\

      \ to have last­\ning consequences for survivors. In essence,\nanything that\
      \ threatens the existence, beliefs,\nwell-being, or livelihood of a community\
      \ is \nlikely to be experienced as traumatic by com­\nmunity members. Whether\
      \ counselors are \nworking with an immigrant or refugee enclave \nin the United\
      \ States or in another country,\nthey should be aware of local events, local\
      \ his­\ntory, and the possibility that clients have en­\ndured trauma. (For\
      \ international information\nabout the clinical, historical, and theoretical\
      \ \naspects of trauma and terrorism, see Danieli,\nBrom, & Sills, 2005.) Terrorism\
      \ is a unique \nsubtype of human-caused disasters. The over­\nall goal of terrorist\
      \ attacks is to maximize the \nuncertainty, anxiety, and fear of a large com­\n\
      munity, so the responses are often epidemic\nand affect large numbers of people\
      \ who have\nhad direct or indirect exposure to an event\n(Silver et al., 2004;\
      \ Suvak, Maguen, Litz, \nSilver, & Holman, 2008). Terrorism has a vari­\nety\
      \ of results not common to other disasters,\nsuch as reminders of the unpredictability\
      \ of\nterrorist acts; increases in security measures for\nthe general population;\
      \ intensified suspicion\nabout a particular population, ethnicity, or cul­\n\
      ture; and heightened awareness and/or arousal. \nRefugees \nAccording to the\
      \ World Refugee Survey,\nthere are an estimated 12 million refugees and\nasylum\
      \ seekers, 21 million internally displaced\npeople, and nearly 35 million uprooted\
      \ people \n(U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immi­\ngrants, 2006). Many of these\
      \ people have sur­\nvived horrendous ordeals with profound and \nlasting effects\
      \ for individuals and whole popu­\nlations. In addition to witnessing deaths\
      \ by \nexecution, starvation, or beatings, many survi­\nvors have experienced\

      \ first Vietnam \nWar led to the 1954 exodus during which 1 million people fled\
      \ from the North to the South. The sec­\nond Vietnam War resulted in the dispersion,\
      \ from 1975-1992, of approximately 2 million Vietnamese all \nover the world.\
      \ These significant, unplanned, and uncoordinated mass movements around the\
      \ world \nnot only dislocated millions of people, but also caused thousands\
      \ upon thousands of deaths at sea.…  \n“The second and third wave of refugees\
      \ from 1976 onward went through a more difficult time. They \nhad to buy their\
      \ way out and to hide from soldiers and the police who hunted them down. After\
      \ \ncatching them, the police either asked for brides or threw the escapees\
      \ into jails. Those who evaded \npolice still had to face engine failures, sea\
      \ storms, pirates…They then had to survive overcrowded \nboats for days or weeks,\
      \ during which food and water could not be replenished and living conditions\
      \ \nwere terrible… Many people died from exhaustion, dehydration, and hunger.\
      \ Others suffered at the \nhands of terrifying pirates… After the sea ordeal\
      \ came the overcrowded camps where living condi­\ntions were most often substandard\
      \ and where security was painfully lacking.… \n“In the United States, within\
      \ less than 3 decades, the Vietnamese population grew from a minority of \n\
      perhaps 1,000 persons to the second largest refugee group behind Cubans.” \n\

      \ seek better op­\nportunities. Although immigrants may experi­\nence trauma\
      \ before migrating to or after\nreaching their new destination, refugees will\
      \ \noften have greater exposure to trauma before \nmigration. Refugees typically\
      \ come from war-\ntorn countries and may have been persecuted\nor tortured.\
      \ Consequently, greater exposure to\ntrauma, such as torture, before migrating\
      \ often\nleads to more adjustment-related difficulties\nand psychological symptoms\
      \ after relocation\n(Steel et al., 2009). \nRefugees typically face substantial\
      \ difficulties \nin assimilating into new countries and cul­\ntures. Moreover,\
      \ the environment can create a\nnew set of challenges that may include addi­\n\
      tional exposure to trauma and social isolation\n(Miller et al., 2002). These\
      \ as well as addition­\nal factors influence adjustment, the develop­\nment\
      \ of mental illness (including PTSD), and \nthe occurrence of substance use\
      \ disorders. Ad­\nditional factors that influence outcomes after \nrelocation\
      \ include receptivity of the local \ncommunity, along with opportunities for\
      \ so­\ncial support and culturally responsive services. \nAmong refugee populations\
      \ in the United\nStates, little research is available on rates of\nmental illness\
      \ and co-occurring substance use \ndisorders and traumatic stress among refugee\
      \ \npopulations. Substance use patterns vary based\non cultural factors as well\
      \ as assimilation, yet\nresearch suggests that trauma increases the \nrisk for\
      \ substance use among refugees after\nwar-related experiences (Kozarić-Kovačić,\n\
      Ljubin, & Grappe, 2000). Therefore, providers \nshould expect to see trauma-related\
      \ disorders \namong refugees who are seeking treatment for\na substance use\
      \ disorder and greater preva­\nlence of substance use disorders among refu­\n\
      gees who seek behavioral health services. \n44"

      \ \n•\nAnticipate and be sensitive to the needs of clients who have experienced\
      \ trauma regarding pro­\ngram policies and procedures in the treatment setting\
      \ that might trigger memories of trauma, \nsuch as lack of privacy, feeling\
      \ pushed to take psychotropic medications, perceiving that they \nhave limited\
      \ choices within the program or in the selection of the program, and so forth.\
      \  \n• \nAttend to clients’ experiences. Ignoring clients’ behavioral and emotional\
      \ reactions to having their \ntraumatic memories triggered is more likely to\
      \ increase these responses than decrease t hem.  \n• \nDevelop an individual\
      \ coping plan in anticipation of triggers that the individual is likely to experi­\n\
      ence in treatment based on his or her history.  \n• \nRehearse routinely the\
      \ coping strategies highlighted in the coping plan. If the client does not \n\
      practice strategies prior to being triggered, the likelihood of being able to\
      \ use them effectively \nupon triggering is lessened. For example, it is far\
      \ easier to practice grounding exercises in the \nabsence of severe fear than\
      \ to wait for that moment when the client is reexperiencing an aspect \nof a\
      \ traumatic event. (For more information on grounding exercises, refer to Seeking\
      \ Safety: A \nTreatment Manual for PTSD and Substance Abuse; Najavits, 2002a,\
      \ pp. 125–131.) \n• \nRecognize that clinical and programmatic efforts to control\
      \ or contain behavior in treatment can \ncause traumatic stress reactions, particularly\
      \ for trauma survivors for whom being trapped was \npart of the trauma experience.\
      \ \n• \nListen for the specific trigger that seems to be driving the client’s\
      \ reaction. It will typically help both \nthe counselor and client understand\
      \ the behavior and normalize the traumatic stress reactions. \n• \nMake sure\
      \ that staff and other clients do not shame the trauma survivor for his or her\
      \ behavior, \nsuch a s through teasing or joking about the situation. \n• \n\
      Respond with consistency. The client should not get conflicting information\
      \ or responses from \ndifferent staff members; this includes information and\
      \ responses given by administrators. \nPart 1, Chapter 2—Trauma Awareness \n\
      System-Oriented Traumas: \nRetraumatization \nRetraumatization occurs when clients\
      \ experi­\nence something that makes them feel as \nthough they are undergoing\
      \ another trauma.\nUnfortunately, treatment settings and clini­\ncians can create\
      \ retraumatizing experiences,\noften without being aware of it, and some­\n\
      times clients themselves are not consciously \naware that a clinical situation\
      \ has actually trig­\ngered a traumatic stress reaction. Agencies that\nanticipate\
      \ the risk for retraumatization and\nactively work on adjusting program policies\
      \ \nand procedures to remain sensitive to the his­\ntories and needs of individuals\
      \ who have un­\ndergone past trauma are likely to have more \nsuccess in providing\
      \ care, retaining clients, and\nachieving positive outcomes. \nStaff and agency\
      \ issues that can cause retrau­\nmatization include: \n•  Being unaware that\
      \ the client’s traumatic \nhistory significantly affects his or her life. \n\
      •  Failing to screen for trauma history prior to\ntreatment planning. \n•  Challenging\
      \ or discounting reports of abuse \nor other traumatic events. \n•  Using isolation\
      \ or physical restraints. \n•  Using experiential exercises that humiliate \n\
      the individual. \n•  Endorsing a confrontational approach in\ncounseling. \n\
      •  Allowing the abusive behavior of one client\ntoward another to continue without\
      \ \nintervention. \n•  Labeling behavior/feelings as pathological. \n•  Failing\
      \ to provide adequate security and\nsafety within the program. \n•  Limiting\
      \ participation of the client in\ntreatment decisions and planning processes.\
      \ \n•  Minimizing, discrediting, or ignoring client \nresponses. \n•  Disrupting\
      \ counselor–client relationships \nby changing counselors’ schedules and\nassignments.\
      \ \n•  Obtaining urine specimens in a nonprivate\nsetting. \n45"

      \ of consistent, competent leadership. \nCharacteristics of Trauma \nThe following\
      \ section highlights several se­\nlected characteristics of traumatic experiences\
      \ \nthat influence the effects of traumatic stress. \nObjective characteristics\
      \ are those elements of\na traumatic event that are tangible or factual;\nsubjective\
      \ characteristics include internal pro­\ncesses, such as perceptions of traumatic\
      \ experi­\nences and meanings assigned to them. \nObjective Characteristics\
      \ \nWas it a single, repeated, or \nsustained trauma? \nTrauma can involve a\
      \ single event, numerous \nor repeated events, or sustained/chronic expe­\n\
      riences. A single trauma is limited to a single \npoint in time. A rape, an\
      \ automobile accident,\nthe sudden death of a loved one—all are ex­\namples\
      \ of a single trauma. Some people who\nexperience a single trauma recover without\
      \ any \nspecific intervention. But for others—\nespecially those with histories\
      \ of previous \ntrauma or mental or substance use disorders,\nor those for whom\
      \ the trauma experience is \nparticularly horrific or overwhelming—a sin­\n\
      gle trauma can result in traumatic stress symp­\ntoms and trauma- and stress-related\
      \ disorders. \nSingle traumas do not necessarily have a lesser\npsychological\
      \ impact than repeated traumas. \nAfter the terrorist attacks on September 11,\n\
      2001—a significant single trauma—many \nManhattan residents experienced intrusive\
      \ \nmemories and sleep disruption whether they \nwere at the site of the attacks\
      \ or watched tele­\nvision coverage of it (Ford & Fournier, 2007;\nGalea et\
      \ al., 2002). \nA series of traumas happening to the same \nperson over time\
      \ is known as repeated trauma. \nThis can include repeated sexual or physical\
      \ \nassaults, exposure to frequent injuries of oth­\ners, or seemingly unrelated\
      \ traumas. Military \npersonnel, journalists covering stories of mass \ntragedies\
      \ or prolonged conflicts, and first re­\nsponders who handle hundreds of cases\
      \ each\nyear typify repeated trauma survivors. Repeti­\ntive exposure to traumas\
      \ can have a cumulative \neffect over one’s lifetime. A person who was \nassaulted\
      \ during adolescence, diagnosed with a \nlife-threatening illness in his or\
      \ her thirties,\nand involved in a serious car accident later in \nlife has\
      \ experienced repeated trauma. \nSome repeated traumas are sustained or\nchronic.\
      \ Sustained trauma experiences tend to\nwear down resilience and the ability\
      \ to adapt.\nSome examples include children who endure \nongoing sexual abuse,\
      \ physical neglect, or\nemotional abuse; people who are in violent\nrelationships;\
      \ and people who live in chronic\npoverty. Individuals in chronically stressful,\n\
      traumatizing environments are particularly \nsusceptible to traumatic stress\
      \ reactions, sub­\nstance use, and mental disorders. \nBidirectional relationships\
      \ exist between\ntrauma and substance use as well as trauma \nand mental illness.\
      \ For example, abuse of al­\ncohol and drugs increases the risk of a trau­\n\
      matic experience and creates greater\nvulnerability to the effects of trauma;\
      \ sub­\nstance abuse reduces a person’s ability to take \ncorrective and remedial\
      \ actions that might\nreduce the impact of the trauma. Likewise,\ntraumatic\
      \ stress leads to a greater likelihood of \n46"

      \ 326 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 69]\nCase Illustration: Yourself \nThink of a time\
      \ that was particularly stressful (but not traumatic) in your life. Revisit\
      \ this period as an \nobserver watching the events unfold and then ask yourself,\
      \ “What made this time particularly stress­\nful?” It is likely that a part\
      \ of your answer will include the difficulty of managing one situation before\
      \ \nanother circumstance came along demanding your time. Stressful times denote\
      \ being bombarded \nwith many things at one time, perceived or actual, without\
      \ sufficient time or ability to address them \nemotionally, cognitively, spiritually,\
      \ and/or physically. The same goes for trauma—rapid exposure to \nnumerous traumas\
      \ one after another lessens one’s ability to process the event before the next\
      \ on­\nslaught. This creates a cumulative effect, making it more difficult to\
      \ heal from any one trauma. \nPart 1, Chapter 2—Trauma Awareness \nsubstance\
      \ abuse that, in turn, increases the risk \nfor additional exposure to trauma.\
      \ Paralleling\nthis bidirectional relationship, mental illness \nincreases vulnerability\
      \ to the effects of trauma\nand raises the risk for substance use disorders\
      \ \nand for encountering additional traumatic \nevents. So too, early exposure\
      \ to ACEs is as­\nsociated with traumatic stress reactions and \nsubsequent\
      \ exposure to trauma in adult years. \nPeople who have encountered multiple\
      \ and\nlonger doses of trauma are at the greatest risk \nfor developing traumatic\
      \ stress. For example,\nmilitary reservists and other military service\nmembers\
      \ who have had multiple long tours of\nduty are at greater risk for traumatic\
      \ stress \nreactions (see the planned TIP, Reintegration-\nRelated Behavioral\
      \ Health Issues in Veterans and \nMilitary Families; SAMHSA, planned f). In\
      \ \naddition, people are more likely to encounter\ngreater impairment and distress\
      \ from trauma\nif that trauma occurs with significant intensity \nand continues\
      \ sporadically or unceasingly for\nextended periods. \nWas there enough time\
      \ to process \nthe experience? \nA particularly severe pattern of ongoing trau­\n\
      ma, sometimes referred to as “cascading trau­\nma,” occurs when multiple traumas\
      \ happen in\na pattern that does not allow an individual to\nheal from one traumatic\
      \ event before another \noccurs. Take, for example, California resi­\ndents—they\
      \ repeatedly face consecutive \nand/or simultaneous natural disasters includ­\n\
      ing fires, landslides, floods, droughts, and\nearthquakes. In other cases, there\
      \ is ample \ntime to process an event, but processing is \nlimited because people\
      \ don’t have supportive \nrelationships or environments that model pre­\nventive\
      \ practices. This can lead to greater vul­\nnerability to traumas that occur\
      \ later in life. \nHow many losses has the trauma \ncaused? \nTrauma itself\
      \ can create significant distress,\nbut often, the losses associated with a\
      \ trauma\nhave more far-reaching effects. For instance, a \nchild may be forced\
      \ to assume adult responsi­\nbilities, such as serving as a confidant for a\
      \ \nparent who is sexually abusing him or her, and \nlose the opportunity of\
      \ a childhood free from \nadult worries. In another scenario, a couple \nmay\
      \ initially feel grateful to have escaped a\nhouse fire, but they may nevertheless\
      \ face sig­\nnificant community and financial losses \nmonths afterward. In\
      \ evaluating the impact of\ntrauma, it is helpful to access and discuss the\
      \ \nlosses associated with the initial trauma. The \nnumber of losses greatly\
      \ influences an individ­\nual’s ability to bounce back from the tragedy. \n\
      In the case illustration on the next page, \nRasheed’s losses cause him to disconnect\
      \ from \nhis wife, who loves and supports him. Success­\nful confrontation of\
      \ losses can be difficult if \nthe losses compound each other, as with\nRasheed’s\
      \ loss of his friend, his disability, his \nemployment struggles, and the threats\
      \ to his \nmarriage and liberty. People can cite a specific \n47"

      \ 326 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 70]\nCase Illustration: Rasheed \nRasheed was referred\
      \ to an employee assistance program by his employer. He considered quitting\
      \ \nhis job, but his wife insisted he talk to a counselor. He is a 41-year-old\
      \ auto mechanic who, 4 years \nago, caused a head-on collision while attempting\
      \ to pass another vehicle. A close friend, riding in \nthe passenger’s seat,\
      \ was killed, and two young people in the other vehicle were seriously injured\
      \ \nand permanently disabled. Rasheed survived with a significant back injury\
      \ and has only been able to \nwork sporadically. He was convicted of negligent\
      \ homicide and placed on probation because of his \nphysical disability. He\
      \ is on probation for another 4 years, and if he is convicted of another felony\
      \ \nduring that time, he will have to serve prison time for his prior offense.\
      \  \nWhile still in the hospital, Rasheed complained of feeling unreal, numb,\
      \ and disinterested in the care \nhe received. He did not remember the crash\
      \ but remembers waking up in the hospital 2 days later. \nHe had difficulty\
      \ sleeping in the hospital and was aware of feelings of impending doom, although\
      \ he \nwas unaware of the legal charges he would later face. He was diagnosed\
      \ with ASD. \nHe was discharged from the hospital with a variety of medications,\
      \ including pain pills and a sleep \naid. He rapidly became dependent on these\
      \ medications, feeling he could not face the day without \nthe pain medication\
      \ and being unable to sleep without sleep medicine in larger doses than had\
      \ \nbeen prescribed. Within 3 months of the accident, he was “doctor shopping”\
      \ for pain pills and even \nhad a friend obtain a prescription for the sleeping\
      \ medication from that friend’s doctor. In the 4 \nintervening years, Rasheed’s\
      \ drug use escalated, and his blunted emotions and detachment from \nfriends\
      \ became more profound. He became adept at obtaining pain pills from a variety\
      \ of sources, \nmost of them illegal. He fears that if he seeks treatment for\
      \ the drug problem, he will have to admit \nto felony offenses and will probably\
      \ be imprisoned. He also does not believe he can manage his life \nwithout the\
      \ pain pills.  \nIn the past 2 years, he has had recurring dreams of driving\
      \ a car on the wrong side of the road and \ninto the headlights of an oncoming\
      \ vehicle. In the dream, he cannot control the car and wakes up \njust before\
      \ the vehicles crash. At unusual times—for instance, when he is just awakening\
      \ in the \nmorning, taking a shower, or walking alone—he will feel profound\
      \ guilt over the death of his friend \nin the accident. He becomes very anxious\
      \ when driving in traffic or when he feels he is driving faster \nthan he should.\
      \ His marriage of 18 years has been marked by increasing emotional distance,\
      \ and his \nwife has talked about separating if he does not do something about\
      \ his problem. He has been \nunable to work consistently because of back pain\
      \ and depression. He was laid off from one job be­\ncause he could not concentrate\
      \ and was making too many mistakes. \nThe counselor in the employee assistance\
      \ program elicited information on Rasheed’s drug use, \nalthough she suspected\
      \ Rasheed was minimizing its extent and effects. Knowledgeable about psy­\n\
      chological trauma, the counselor helped Rasheed feel safe enough to talk about\
      \ the accident and \nhow it had affected his life. She was struck by how little\
      \ Rasheed connected his present difficulties to \nthe accident and its aftermath.\
      \ The counselor later commented that Rasheed talked about the acci­\ndent as\
      \ if it had happened to someone else. Rasheed agreed to continue seeing the\
      \ counselor for \nfive additional visits, during which time a plan would be\
      \ made for Rasheed to begin treatment for \ndrug dependence and PTSD. \nTrauma-Informed\
      \ Care in Behavioral Health Services \nevent as precipitating their trauma,\
      \ or, in oth­\ner cases, the specific trauma can symbolize a\nseries of disabling\
      \ events in which the person\nfelt his or her life was threatened or in which\
      \ \nhe or she felt emotionally overwhelmed, psy­\nchologically disorganized,\
      \ or significantly dis­\nconnected from his or her surroundings. It \nwill be\
      \ important for Rasheed to understand \nhow his losses played a part in his\
      \ abuse of\nprescription medications to cope with symp­\ntoms associated with\
      \ traumatic stress and loss,\n(e.g., guilt, depression, fear). If not addressed,\n\

      \ 326 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 71]\nPart 1, Chapter 2—Trauma Awareness \nWas the\
      \ trauma expected or \nunexpected? \nWhen talking about a trauma, people some­\n\
      times say they didn’t see it coming. Being un­\nprepared, unaware, and vulnerable\
      \ often \nincreases the risk of psychological injury, but\nthese are common\
      \ components of most trau­\nmas, given that most traumatic events do oc­\ncur\
      \ without warning (e.g., car crashes, terrorist\nattacks, sexual assaults).\
      \ People with substance \nuse disorders, mental illness, and/or cognitive \n\
      disabilities may be especially vulnerable in that\nthey may attend less or have\
      \ competing con­\ncerns that diminish attention to what is going\non around\
      \ them, even in high-risk environ­\nments. However, most individuals attempt\
      \ to\ngain some control over the tragedy by replay­\ning the moments leading\
      \ up to the event and\nprocessing how they could have anticipated it.\nSome\
      \ people perseverate on these thoughts for\nmonths or years after the event.\
      \ \nSometimes, a trauma is anticipated but has\nunexpected or unanticipated\
      \ consequences, as \nin the case of Hurricane Katrina. Learning\nabout what\
      \ is likely to happen can reduce \ntraumatization. For instance, training military\n\
      personnel in advance of going to combat over­\nseas prepares them to handle\
      \ traumas and can\nreduce the impact of trauma. \nWere the trauma’s effects\
      \ on the \nperson’s life isolated or pervasive? \nWhen a trauma is isolated\
      \ from the larger\ncontext of life, a person’s response to it is more \nlikely\
      \ to be contained and limited. For in­\nstance, military personnel in combat\
      \ situations \ncan be significantly traumatized by what they\nexperience. On\
      \ return to civilian life or non-\ncombat service, some are able to isolate\
      \ the \ntraumatic experience so that it does not invade \nordinary, day-to-day\
      \ living. This does not\nmean that the combat experience was not dis­\nturbing\
      \ or that it will not resurface if the indi­\nvidual encounters an experience\
      \ that triggers \nmemories of the trauma; it just means that the\nperson can\
      \ more easily leave the trauma in the\npast and attend to the present. \nConversely,\
      \ people who remain in the vicinity \nof the trauma may encounter greater chal­\n\
      lenges in recovery. The traumatic event inter­\ntwines with various aspects\
      \ of the person’s \ndaily activities and interactions, thus increas­\ning the\
      \ possibility of being triggered by sur­\nrounding cues and experiencing subsequent\n\
      psychological distress. However, another way \nto view this potential dilemma\
      \ for the client is \nto reframe it as an opportunity—the repetitive \nexposure\
      \ to trauma-related cues may provide \nvital guidance as to when and which treatment\n\
      and coping techniques to use in the delivery of\ntrauma-informed and trauma-specific\
      \ behav­\nioral health services. \nWho was responsible for the trauma \nand\
      \ was the act intentional? \nIf the severity of a trauma is judged solely by\
      \ \nwhether the act was intentional or not, events \nthat reflect an intention\
      \ to harm would be a \nprimary indicator in predicting subsequent\ndifficulties\
      \ among individuals exposed to this \nform of trauma. For most survivors, there\
      \ is an\ninitial disbelief that someone would conceiva­\nbly intend to harm\
      \ others, followed by consid­\nerable emotional and, at times, behavioral \n\
      investment in somehow making things right\nagain or in making sense of a senseless,\
      \ mali­\ncious act. For instance, in the wake of the \nWorld Trade Center attacks\
      \ in New York \nCity, people responded via renewed patriot­\nism, impromptu\
      \ candlelight vigils, attacks on\npeople of Arab and Muslim descent, and un­\n\
      precedented donations and willingness to wait\nin long lines to donate blood\
      \ to the Red\nCross. Each example is a response that in\nsome way attempts to\
      \ right the perceived \nwrong or attach new meaning to the event and\nsubsequent\
      \ consequences. \n49"

      \ abuse treatment with diagnoses of co-occurring PTSD and substance use \ndisorder.\
      \ While on a whitewater kayak trip with his wife, her kayak became pinned on\
      \ a rock, and \nFrank could only watch helplessly as she drowned. His drinking\
      \ had increased markedly after the ac­\ncident. He acknowledged a vicious cycle\
      \ of sleep disturbance with intrusive nightmares followed by \nvivid memories\
      \ and feelings of terror and helplessness after he awoke. He drank heavily at\
      \ night to \nquiet the nightmares and memories, but heavy alcohol consumption\
      \ perpetuated his trouble sleep­\ning. He withdrew from contact with many of\
      \ his old “couple friends” and his wife’s family, with whom \nhe had been close.\
      \ At treatment entry, he described his life as “going to work and coming home.”\
      \ \nThe trauma occurred 3 years before he sought treatment, but Frank continued\
      \ to feel numb and dis­\nconnected from the world. His only emotion was anger,\
      \ which he tried to keep in check. Integrated \ntreatment for PTSD and substance\
      \ abuse helped him sleep and taught him coping skills to use when \nthe memories\
      \ arose; it fostered his engagement and retention in long-term care for both\
      \ disorders. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nWhen terrible\
      \ things happen, it is human na­\nture to assign blame. Trauma survivors can\n\
      become heavily invested in assigning blame or\nfinding out who was at fault,\
      \ regardless of the \ntype of trauma. Often, this occurs as an at­\ntempt to\
      \ make sense of, give meaning to, and\nreestablish a sense of predictability,\
      \ control, \nand safety after an irrational or random act. It\nis far easier\
      \ to accept that someone, including\noneself, is at fault or could have done\
      \ some­\nthing different than it is to accept the fact that \none was simply\
      \ in the wrong place at the \nwrong time. \nFor some trauma survivors, needing\
      \ to find\nout why a trauma occurred or who is at fault\ncan become a significant\
      \ block to growth \nwhen the individual would be better served by \nasking,\
      \ “What do I need to do to heal?” Be­\nhavioral health professionals can help\
      \ clients \ntranslate what they have learned about respon­\nsibility in recovery\
      \ to other aspects of their\nlives. For instance, someone in treatment for \n\
      co-occurring disorders who has internalized\nthat becoming depressed or addicted\
      \ was not\nhis or her fault, but that recovery is a personal \nresponsibility,\
      \ can then apply the same princi­\nple to the experience of childhood abuse\
      \ and \nthereby overcome negative judgments of self\n(e.g., thinking oneself\
      \ to be a bad person who\ndeserves abuse). The individual can then begin\nto\
      \ reassign responsibility by attaching the \nblame to the perpetrator(s) while\
      \ at the same\ntime assuming responsibility for recovery. \nWas the trauma experienced\
      \ directly \nor indirectly? \nTrauma that happens to someone directly \nseems\
      \ to be more damaging than witnessing\ntrauma that befalls others. For example,\
      \ it is \nusually more traumatic to be robbed at gun­\npoint than to witness\
      \ someone else being\nrobbed or hearing someone tell a story about\nbeing robbed.\
      \ Yet, sometimes, experiencing\nanother’s pain can be equally traumatic. For\n\
      instance, parents often internalize the pain\nand suffering of their children\
      \ when the chil­\ndren are undergoing traumatic circumstances\n(e.g., treatments\
      \ for childhood cancer). \nThere are two ways to experience the trauma\nof others.\
      \ An individual may witness the event,\nsuch as seeing someone killed or seriously\
      \ in­\njured in a car accident, or may learn of an\nevent that happened to someone,\
      \ such as a\nviolent personal assault, suicide, serious acci­\ndent, injury,\
      \ or sudden or unexpected death.\nFor many people, the impact of the trauma\n\
      will depend on a host of variables, including\ntheir proximity to the event\
      \ as eyewitnesses, \nthe witnesses’ response in the situation, their\nrelationship\
      \ to the victims, the degree of help­\nlessness surrounding the experience,\
      \ their ex­\nposure to subsequent consequences, and so on. \n50"

      \ is \nnot nearly as \nimportant as what \nthe trauma means \nto the individual.\
      \ \nPart 1, Chapter 2—Trauma Awareness \nThe effects of traumas such as genocide\
      \ and\ninternment in concentration camps can be felt\nacross generations—stories,\
      \ coping behaviors,\nand stress reactions can be passed across gen­\nerational\
      \ lines far removed from the actual \nevents or firsthand accounts. Known as\
      \ histor­\nical trauma, this type of trauma can affect the\nfunctioning of families,\
      \ communities, and\ncultures for multiple generations. \nWhat happened since\
      \ the trauma? \nIn reviewing traumatic events, it is important\nto assess the\
      \ degree of disruption after the \ninitial trauma has passed, such as the loss\
      \ of\nemployment, assets, community events, behav­\nioral health services, local\
      \ stores, and recrea­\ntional areas. There is typically an initial rally of\n\
      services and support following a trauma, par­\nticularly if it is on a mass\
      \ scale. However, the \nreality of the trauma’s effects and their disrup­\n\
      tiveness may have a more lasting impact. The \ndeterioration of normalcy, including\
      \ the dis­\nruption of day-to-day activities and the dam­\nage of structures\
      \ that house these routines, will \nlikely erode the common threads that provide\
      \ \na sense of safety in individual lives and com­\nmunities. Hence, the degree\
      \ of disruption in\nresuming normal daily activities is a significant\nrisk\
      \ factor for substance use disorders, subclin­\nical psychological symptoms,\
      \ and mental dis­\norders. For example, adults displaced from \ntheir homes\
      \ because of Hurricanes Katrina or \nRita had significantly higher rates of\
      \ past-\nmonth cigarette use, illicit drug use, and binge \ndrinking than those\
      \ who were not displaced\n(Office of Applied Studies, 2008). \nSubjective Characteristics\
      \ \nPsychological meaning of trauma \nAn important clinical issue in understanding\n\
      the impact of trauma is the meaning that the\nsurvivor has attached to the traumatic\
      \ experi­\nence. Survivors’ unique cognitive interpreta­\ntions of an event—that\
      \ is, their beliefs and \nassumptions—\ncontribute to how \nthey process, react\
      \ to, \ncope with, and recov­\ner from the trauma. \nDoes the event repre­\n\
      sent retribution for \npast deeds committed \nby the individual or his or her\
      \ family? How \ndoes the individual attach meaning to his or \nher survival?\
      \ Does he or she believe that it is a \nsign of a greater purpose not yet revealed?\n\
      People who attempt to share their interpreta­\ntion and meaning of the event\
      \ can feel misun­\nderstood and sometimes alienated (Paulson &\nKrippner, 2007;\
      \ Schein, Spitz, Burlingame, &\nMuskin, 2006). \nPeople interpret traumatic\
      \ events in vastly \ndifferent ways, and many variables shape how \nan individual\
      \ assigns meaning to the experi­\nence (framing the meaning through culture,\n\
      family beliefs, prior life experiences and learn­\ning, personality and other\
      \ psychological fea­\ntures, etc.). Even in an event that happens in a \nhousehold,\
      \ each family member may interpret\nthe experience differently. Likewise, the\
      \ same \ntype of event can occur at two different times \nin a person’s life,\
      \ but his or her interpretation\nof the events may differ considerably because\
      \ \nof developmental differences acquired between\nevents, current cognitive\
      \ and emotional pro­\ncessing skills, availability of and access to envi­\n\
      ronmental resources, and so forth. \nDisruption of core assumptions and \nbeliefs\
      \ \nTrauma often engenders a crisis of faith\n(Frankl, 1992) that leads clients\
      \ to question\nbasic assumptions about life. Were the indi­\nvidual’s core or\
      \ life-organizing assumptions\n(e.g., about safety, perception of others, fair­\n\
      ness, purpose of life, future dreams) chal­\nlenged or disrupted during or after\
      \ the \ntraumatic event? (See the seminal work, \n51"

      \ suggests that reestablishing ties to family, community, culture, and spiritual\
      \ systems is not \nonly vital to the individual, but it also influences the\
      \ impact of the trauma upon future generations. \nFor example, Baker and Gippenreiter\
      \ (1998) studied the descendants of survivors of Joseph Stalin’s \npurge. They\
      \ found that families who were able to maintain a sense of connection and continuity\
      \ with \ngrandparents directly affected by the purge experienced fewer negative\
      \ effects than those who were \nemotionally or physically severed from their\
      \ grandparents. Whether the grandparents survived was \nless important than\
      \ the connection the grandchildren felt to their pasts. \nTrauma-Informed Care\
      \ in Behavioral Health Services \nShattered Assumptions, by Janoff-Bulman,\n\
      1992.) For example, some trauma survivors see \nthemselves as irreparably wounded\
      \ or beyond\nthe possibility of healing. The following case \nillustration (Sonja)\
      \ explores not only the im­\nportance of meaning, but also the role that \n\
      trauma plays in altering an individual’s core \nassumptions—the very assumptions\
      \ that pro­\nvide meaning and a means to organize our lives \nand our interactions\
      \ with the world and others. \nCultural meaning of trauma \nCounselors should\
      \ strive to appreciate the \ncultural meaning of a trauma. How do cultural \n\
      interpretations, cultural support, and cultural \nresponses affect the experience\
      \ of trauma? It is \ncritical that counselors do not presume to un­\nderstand\
      \ the meaning of a traumatic experi­\nence without considering the client’s\
      \ cultural \ncontext. Culture strongly influences the per­\nceptions of trauma.\
      \ For instance, a trauma \ninvolving shame can be more profound for a\nperson\
      \ from an Asian culture than for some­\none from a European culture. Likewise,\
      \ an\nAlaska Native individual or community, de­\npending upon their Tribal\
      \ ancestry, may be­\nlieve that the traumatic experience serves as a\nform of\
      \ retribution. Similarly, the sudden\ndeath of a family member or loved one\
      \ can be \nless traumatic in a culture that has a strong\nbelief in a positive\
      \ afterlife. It is important for\ncounselors to recognize that their perceptions\
      \ \nof a specific trauma could be very different\nfrom their clients’ perceptions.\
      \ Be careful not \nto judge a client’s beliefs in light of your own\nvalue system.\
      \ For more information on culture \nand how to achieve cultural competence in\n\
      providing behavioral health services, see \nSAMHSA’s planned TIP, Improving\
      \ Cultural \nCompetence (SAMHSA, planned c). \nIndividual and \nSociocultural\
      \ Features \nA wide variety of social, demographic, envi­\nronmental, and psychological\
      \ factors influence \na person’s experience of trauma, the severity of\ntraumatic\
      \ stress reactions following the event,\nand his or her resilience in dealing\
      \ with the \nshort- and long-term environmental, physical,\nsociocultural, and\
      \ emotional consequences.\nThis section addresses a few known factors \nthat\
      \ influence the risk of trauma along with\nthe development of subclinical and\
      \ diagnostic\ntraumatic stress symptoms, such as mood and\nanxiety symptoms\
      \ and disorders. It is not\nmeant to be an exhaustive exploration of these \n\

      \ to talk about how her life was different after being physically assaulted\
      \ and robbed in a \nparking lot at a local strip mall a year ago. She recounts\
      \ that even though there were people in the \nparking lot, no one came to her\
      \ aid until the assailant ran off with her purse. She sustained a cheek­\nbone\
      \ fracture and developed visual difficulties due to the inflammation from the\
      \ fracture. She re­\ncently sought treatment for depressive symptoms and reported\
      \ that she had lost interest in activities \nthat typically gave her joy. She\
      \ reported isolating herself from others and said that her perception of \n\
      others had changed dramatically since the attack. \nSonja had received a diagnosis\
      \ of major depression with psychotic features 10 years earlier and re­\nceived\
      \ group therapy at a local community mental health center for 3 years until\
      \ her depression \nwent into remission. She recently became afraid that her\
      \ depression was becoming more pro­\nnounced, and she wanted to prevent another\
      \ severe depressive episode as well as the use of psy­\nchotropic medications,\
      \ which she felt made her lethargic. Thus, she sought out behavioral health\
      \ \ncounseling. \nAs the sessions progressed, and after a psychological evaluation,\
      \ it was clear that Sonja had some \ndepressive s ymptoms, but they were subclinical.\
      \ She denied suicidal thoughts or i ntent, and her \nthought process was organized\
      \ with no evidence of hallucinations or delusions. She described her \nisolation\
      \ as a reluctance to shop at area stores. On one hand, Sonja was self-compassionate\
      \ about \nher reasons for avoidance, but on the other hand, she was concerned\
      \ that the traumatic event had \naltered how she saw life and others. “I don’t\
      \ see people as very caring or kind, like I used to prior to \nthe event. I\
      \ don’t trust them, and I feel people are too self-absorbed. I don’t feel safe,\
      \ and this \nbothers me. I worry that I’m becoming paranoid again. I guess I\
      \ know better, but I just want to have \nthe freedom to do what I want and go\
      \ where I want.”  \nTwo months after Sonja initiated counseling, she came to\
      \ the office exclaiming that things can in­\ndeed change. “You won’t believe\
      \ it. I had to go to the grocery store, so I forced myself to go the \nshopping\
      \ center that had a grocery store attached to a strip mall. I was walking by\
      \ a coffee shop, \nquickly browsing the items in the front window, when a man\
      \ comes out of the shop talking at me. \nHe says, ‘You look like you need a\
      \ cup of coffee.’ What he said didn’t register immediately. I looked \nat him\
      \ blankly, and he said it again. ‘You look like you need a cup of coffee. I’m\
      \ the owner of the \nshop, and I noticed you looking in the window, and we have\
      \ plenty of brewed coffee left before we \nclose the shop. Come on in, it’s\
      \ on the house.’ So I did! From that moment on, I began to see peo­\nple differently.\
      \ He set it right for me—I feel as if I have myself back again, as if the assault\
      \ was a sign \nthat I shouldn’t trust people, and now I see that there is some\
      \ goodness in the world. As small as \nthis kindness was, it gave me the hope\
      \ that I had lost.” \nFor Sonja, the assault changed her assumptions about safety\
      \ and her view of others. She also at­\ntached meaning to the event. She believed\
      \ that the event was a sign that she shouldn’t trust people \nand that people\
      \ are uncaring. Yet these beliefs bothered her and contradicted how she saw\
      \ herself \nin the world, and she was afraid that her depressive symptoms were\
      \ returning.  \nFor an inexperienced professional, her presentation may have\
      \ ignited suspicions that she was be­\nginning to present with psychotic features.\
      \ However, it is common for trauma survivors to experi­\nence changes in core\
      \ assumptions immediately after the event and to attach meaning to the trauma.\
      \ \nOften, a key ingredient in the recovery process is first identifying the\
      \ meaning of the event and the \nbeliefs that changed following the traumatic\
      \ experience. So when you hear a client say “I will never \nsee life the same,”\
      \ this expression should trigger further exploration into how life is different,\
      \ what \nmeaning has been assigned to the trauma, and how the individual has\
      \ changed his or her perception \nof self, others, and the future.  \n(Continued\

      \ reworking the altered beliefs and assumptions occurs with no formal intervention,\
      \ as \nwith Sonja. In her situation, a random stranger provided a moment that\
      \ challenged an assumption \ngenerated from the trauma. For others, counseling\
      \ may be helpful in identifying how beliefs and \nthoughts about self, others,\
      \ and the world have changed since the event and how to rework them to \nmove\
      \ beyond the trauma. It is important to understand that the meaning that an\
      \ individual attaches \nto the event(s) can either undermine the healing process\
      \ (e.g., believing that you should not have \nsurvived, feeling shame about\
      \ the trauma, continuing to engage in high-risk activities) or pave the \nroad\
      \ to recovery (e.g., volunteering to protect victim rights after being sexually\
      \ assaulted). The fol­\nlowing questions can help behavioral health staff members\
      \ introduce topics surrounding assump­\ntions, beliefs, interpretations, and\
      \ meanings related to trauma:  \n•\nIn what ways has your life been different\
      \ since the trauma? \n• \nHow do you understand your survival? (This is an important\
      \ question for clients who have been \nexposed to ACEs or cumulative trauma\
      \ and those who survived a tragedy when others did not.) \n• \nDo you believe\
      \ that there are reasons that this event happened to you? What are they? \n\
      • \nWhat meaning does this experience have for you? \n• \nDo you feel that you\
      \ are the same person as before the trauma? In what ways are you the same?\n\
      In what ways do you feel different? \n \n• \nHow did this experience change\
      \ you as a person? Would you like to return to the person you \nonce were? What\
      \ would you need to do, or what would need to happen, for this to occur? \n\
      • \nDid the traumatic experience change you in a way that you don’t like? In\
      \ what ways? \n• \nHow do you view others and your future differently since\

      \ as his or her reactions \nto, trauma. However, many factors influence \nindividual\
      \ responses to trauma; it is not just\nindividual characteristics. Failing to\
      \ recognize\nthat multiple factors aside from individual\nattributes and history\
      \ influence experiences \nduring and after trauma can lead to blaming\nthe victim\
      \ for having traumatic stress. \nHistory of prior psychological \ntrauma \n\
      People with histories of prior psychological \ntrauma appear to be the most\
      \ susceptible to\nsevere traumatic responses (Nishith, Mechanic, \n& Resick,\
      \ 2000; Vogt, Bruce, Street, &\nStafford, 2007), particularly if they have \n\
      avoided addressing past traumas. Because \nminimization, dissociation, and avoidance\
      \ are\ncommon defenses for many trauma survivors,\nprior traumas are not always\
      \ consciously avail­\nable, and when they are, memories can be \ndistorted to\
      \ avoid painful affects. Some survi­\nvors who have repressed their experiences\
      \ de­\nny a history of trauma or are unable to explain \ntheir strong reactions\
      \ to present situations. \nRemember that the effects of trauma are cu­\nmulative;\
      \ therefore, a later trauma that out­\nwardly appears less severe may have more\
      \ \nimpact upon an individual than a trauma that\noccurred years earlier. Conversely,\
      \ individuals\nwho have experienced earlier traumas may \nhave developed effective\
      \ coping strategies or\nreport positive outcomes as they have learned\nto adjust\
      \ to the consequences of the trauma(s).\nThis outcome is often referred to as\
      \ posttrau­\nmatic growth or psychological growth. \nClients in behavioral health\
      \ treatment who \nhave histories of trauma can respond negative­\nly to or seem\
      \ disinterested in treatment efforts.\nThey may become uncomfortable in groups\
      \ \nthat emphasize personal sharing; likewise, an\nindividual who experiences\
      \ brief bouts of dis­\nsociation (a reaction of some trauma survivors)\nmay\
      \ be misunderstood by others in treatment\nand seen as uninterested. Providers\

      \ of labeling\nclients’ behavior as pathological. \nHistory of resilience \n\
      Resilience—the ability to thrive despite nega­\ntive life experiences and heal\
      \ from traumatic\nevents—is related to the internal strengths and\nenvironmental\
      \ supports of an individual. Most\nindividuals are resilient despite experiencing\n\
      traumatic stress. The ability to thrive beyond\nthe trauma is associated with\
      \ individual factors \nas well as situational and contextual factors. \nThere\
      \ are not only one or two primary factors\nthat make an individual resilient;\
      \ many factors\ncontribute to the development of resilience.\nThere is little\
      \ research to indicate that there are \nspecific traits predictive of resilience;\
      \ instead, it\nappears that more general characteristics influ­\nence resilience,\
      \ including neurobiology (Feder,\nCharney, & Collins, 2011), flexibility in\
      \ adapt­\ning to change, beliefs prior to trauma, sense of\nself-efficacy, and\
      \ ability to experience positive \nemotions (Bonanno & Mancini, 2011). \nHistory\
      \ of mental disorders \nThe correlations among traumatic stress, sub­\nstance\
      \ use disorders, and co-occurring mental \ndisorders are well known. According\
      \ to the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis­\norders, Fifth Edition\
      \ (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2013a), traumatic stress reactions \n\
      are linked to higher rates of mood, substance-\nrelated, anxiety, trauma, stress-related,\
      \ and\nother mental disorders, each of which can pre­\ncede, follow, or emerge\
      \ concurrently with\ntrauma itself. A co-occurring mental disorder \nis a significant\
      \ determinant of whether an\nindividual can successfully address and resolve\
      \ \ntrauma as it emerges from the past or occurs \nin the present. Koenen, Stellman,\
      \ Stellman,\nand Sommer (2003) found that the risk of \ndeveloping PTSD following\
      \ combat trauma \nwas higher for individuals with preexisting\nconduct disorder,\
      \ panic disorder, generalized \nanxiety disorder, and/or major depression than\n\
      for those without preexisting mental disorders. \nFor additional information\
      \ on comorbidity of\ntrauma and other mental disorders, see TIP\n42, Substance\
      \ Abuse Treatment for Persons With \nCo-Occurring Disorders (CSAT, 2005c). \n\
      Sociodemographic Factors \nDemographic variables are not good predic­\ntors\
      \ of who will experience trauma and subse­\nquent traumatic stress reactions.\
      \ Gender, age, \nrace and ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital\nstatus, occupation,\
      \ income, and education can\nall have some influence, but not enough to\ndetermine\
      \ who should or should not receive \nscreening for trauma and traumatic stress\
      \ \nsymptoms. The following sections cover a few\nselected variables. (For more\
      \ information,\nplease refer to Part 3 of this TIP, the online \nliterature\
      \ review.) \nGender \nIn the United States, men are at greater risk \nthan women\
      \ for being exposed to stressful \nevents. Despite the higher prevalence among\n\
      men, lifetime PTSD occurs at about twice the \nrate among women as it does in\
      \ men. Less is \nknown about gender differences with subclini­\ncal traumatic\
      \ stress reactions. There are also \nother gender differences, such as the types\
      \ of\ntrauma experienced by men and women.\nWomen are more likely to experience\
      \ physical \nand sexual assault, whereas men are most like­\nly to experience\
      \ combat and crime victimiza­\ntion and to witness killings and serious injuries\n\
      (Breslau, 2002; Kimerling, Ouimette, &\nWeitlauf, 2007; Tolin & Foa, 2006).\
      \ Women\nin military service are subject to the same risks \nas men and are\
      \ also at a greater risk for mili­\ntary sexual trauma. Men’s traumas often\
      \ occur \nin public; women’s are more likely to take \nplace in private settings.\
      \ Perpetrators of trau­\nmas against men are often strangers, but wom­\nen are\
      \ more likely to know the perpetrator. \n55"

      \ \nThe following list highlights characteristics that often nurture resilience\
      \ among individuals from di­\nverse cultural, racial, and ethnic groups: \n\
      •\nStrong kinship bonds \n• \nRespect for elders and the importance of extended\
      \ family \n• \nSpirituality and religious practices (e.g., shrine visitations\
      \ or the use of traditional healers) \n• \nValue in friendships and warm personal\
      \ relationships  \n• \nExpression of humor and creativity \n• \nInstilling a\
      \ sense of history, heritage, and historical traditions \n• \nCommunity orientation,\
      \ activities, and socialization \n• \nStrong work ethic \n• \nPhilosophies and\
      \ beliefs about life, suffering, and perseverance\n“Fortune owes its existence\
      \ to misfortune, and misfortune is hidden in fortune.” \n–Lao-Tzu teaching,\
      \ Taoism (Wong & Wong, 2006) \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \nAge \nIn general, the older one becomes, the higher\nthe risk of trauma—but\
      \ the increase is not \ndramatic. Age is not particularly important in\npredicting\
      \ exposure to trauma, yet at no age is\none immune to the risk. However, trauma\
      \ that\noccurs in the earlier and midlife years appears \nto have greater impact\
      \ on people for different\nreasons. For younger individuals, the trauma\ncan\
      \ affect developmental processes, attach­\nment, emotional regulation, life\
      \ assumptions,\ncognitive interpretations of later experiences,\nand so forth\
      \ (for additional resources, visit the \nNational Child Traumatic Stress Network;\n\
      http://www.nctsn.org/). For adults in midlife,\ntrauma may have a greater impact\
      \ due to the\nenhanced stress or burden of care that often \ncharacterizes this\
      \ stage of life—caring for \ntheir children and their parents at the same \n\
      time. Older adults are as likely as younger\nadults to recover quickly from\
      \ trauma, yet they\nmay have greater vulnerabilities, including\ntheir ability\
      \ to survive without injury and their\nability to address the current trauma\
      \ without\npsychological interference from earlier stress­\nful or traumatic\
      \ events. Older people are natu­\nrally more likely to have had a history of\n\
      trauma because they have lived longer, thus \ncreating greater vulnerability\
      \ to the effects of\ncumulative trauma. \nRace, ethnicity, and culture \nThe\
      \ potential for trauma exists in all major\nracial and ethnic groups in American\
      \ society,\nyet few studies analyze the relationship of race \nand ethnicity\
      \ to trauma exposure and/or trau­\nmatic stress reactions. Some studies show\
      \ that \ncertain racial and ethnic groups are at greater\nrisk for specific\
      \ traumas. For example, African\nAmericans experienced higher rates of overall\
      \ \nviolence, aggravated assault, and robbery than\nWhites but were as likely\
      \ to be victims of rape \nor sexual assault (Catalano, 2004). Literature \n\
      reflects that diverse ethnic, racial, and cultural \ngroups are more likely\
      \ to experience adverse \neffects from various traumas and to meet crite­\n\
      ria for posttraumatic stress (Bell, 2011). \nSexual orientation and gender identity\
      \ \nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender indi­\nviduals are likely to experience\
      \ various forms \nof trauma associated with their sexual orienta­\ntion, including\
      \ harsh consequences from fami­\nlies and faith traditions, higher risk of assault\n\
      from casual sexual partners, hate crimes, lack \nof legal protection, and laws\
      \ of exclusion\n(Brown, 2008). Gay and bisexual men as well \nas transgender\
      \ people are more likely to expe­\nrience victimization than lesbians and bisexual\
      \ \nwomen. Dillon (2001) reported a trauma ex­\nposure rate of 94 percent among\
      \ lesbian, gay, \n56"

      \ or a place not\nintended for use as a dwelling (e.g., a bus sta­\ntion). The\

      \ 660,000 and 730,000 individuals\nwere homeless on any given night in 2005\n\
      (HUD, 2007). Two thirds were unaccompa­\nnied persons; the other third were\
      \ people in \nfamilies. Adults who are homeless and unmar­\nried are more likely\
      \ to be male than female.\nAbout 40 percent of men who are homeless \nare veterans\
      \ (National Coalition for the\nHomeless, 2002); this percentage has grown,\n\
      including the number of veterans with de­\npendent children (Kuhn & Nakashima,\
      \ 2011). \nRates of trauma symptoms are high among\npeople who are homeless\
      \ (76 to 100 percent of \nwomen and 67 percent of men; Christensen et\nal.,\
      \ 2005; Jainchill, Hawke, & Yagelka, 2000),\nand the diagnosis of PTSD is among\
      \ the most\nprevalent non-substance use Axis I disorders\n(Lester et al., 2007;\
      \ McNamara, Schumacher,\nMilby, Wallace, & Usdan, 2001). People who\nare homeless\
      \ report high levels of trauma (es­\npecially physical and sexual abuse in childhood\n\
      or as adults) preceding their homeless status;\nassault, rape, and other traumas\
      \ frequently \nhappen while they are homeless. Research\nsuggests that many\
      \ women are homeless be­\ncause they are fleeing domestic violence \n(National\
      \ Coalition for the Homeless, 2002).\nOther studies suggest that women who are\
      \ \nhomeless are more likely to have histories of \nchildhood physical and sexual\
      \ abuse and to\nhave experienced sexual assault as adults. A\nhistory of physical\
      \ and/or sexual abuse is even\nmore common among women who are home­\nless and\
      \ have a serious mental illness. \nYouth who are homeless, especially those\
      \ who\nlive without a parent, are likely to have experi­\nenced physical and/or\
      \ sexual abuse. Between\n21 and 42 percent of youth runaways report\nhaving\

      \ \nfrom 32 to 63 percent (Administration on \nChildren, Youth and Families,\

      \ youth who are homeless and have \nhistories of abuse. \nMore than half of\
      \ people who are homeless \nhave a lifetime prevalence of mental illness \n\
      and substance use disorders. Those who are \nhomeless have higher rates of substance\
      \ abuse \n(84 percent of men and 58 percent of women), \nand substance use disorders,\

      \ and the outcome of behavioral health services.\nThis chapter examines common\
      \ experiences survivors may encoun­\nter immediately following or long after\
      \ a traumatic experience. \nTrauma, including one-time, multiple, or long-lasting\
      \ repetitive \nevents, affects everyone differently. Some individuals may clearly\
      \ \ndisplay criteria associated with posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD),\
      \ but many more individuals will exhibit resilient responses \nor brief subclinical\
      \ symptoms or consequences that fall outside of\ndiagnostic criteria. The impact\
      \ of trauma can be subtle, insidious,\nor outright destructive. How an event\
      \ affects an individual depends \non many factors, including characteristics\
      \ of the individual, the\ntype and characteristics of the event(s), developmental\
      \ processes,\nthe meaning of the trauma, and sociocultural factors. \nThis chapter\
      \ begins with an overview of common responses,\nemphasizing that traumatic stress\
      \ reactions are normal reactions to\nabnormal circumstances. It highlights common\
      \ short- and long­\nterm responses to traumatic experiences in the context of\
      \ individuals \nwho may seek behavioral health services.This chapter discusses\n\
      psychological symptoms not represented in the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual\

      \ Health Services—The Impact of Trauma \nSequence of Trauma \nReactions \nSurvivors’\
      \ immediate reactions in the after­\nmath of trauma are quite complicated and\
      \ are\naffected by their own experiences, the accessi­\nbility of natural supports\
      \ and healers, their \ncoping and life skills and those of immediate \nfamily,\
      \ and the responses of the larger com­\nmunity in which they live. Although\
      \ reactions \nrange in severity, even the most acute responses\nare natural\
      \ responses to manage trauma—\nthey are not a sign of psychopathology. Cop­\n\
      ing styles vary from action oriented to reflec­\ntive and from emotionally expressive\
      \ to\nreticent. Clinically, a response style is less im­\nportant than the degree\
      \ to which coping ef­\nforts successfully allow one to continue \nnecessary\
      \ activities, regulate emotions, sustain\nself-esteem, and maintain and enjoy\
      \ interper­\nsonal contacts. Indeed, a past error in trau­\nmatic stress psychology,\
      \ particularly regarding\ngroup or mass traumas, was the assumption\nthat all\
      \ survivors need to express emotions\nassociated with trauma and talk about\
      \ the \ntrauma; more recent research indicates that\nsurvivors who choose not\
      \ to process their\ntrauma are just as psychologically healthy as \n60\n\n[Page\
      \ 83]\nPart 1, Chapter 3—Understanding the Impact of Trauma \nthose who do.\
      \ The most recent psychological \ndebriefing approaches emphasize respecting\n\
      the individual’s style of coping and not valuing\none type over another. \n\
      Initial reactions to trauma can include exhaus­\ntion, confusion, sadness, anxiety,\
      \ agitation,\nnumbness, dissociation, confusion, physical \narousal, and blunted\
      \ affect. Most responses are \nnormal in that they affect most survivors and\n\
      are socially acceptable, psychologically effec­\ntive, and self-limited. Indicators\
      \ of more se­\nvere responses include continuous distress \nwithout periods\
      \ of relative calm or rest, severe \ndissociation symptoms, and intense intrusive\
      \ \nrecollections that continue despite a return to\nsafety. Delayed responses\
      \ to trauma can in­\nclude persistent fatigue, sleep disorders,\nnightmares,\
      \ fear of recurrence, anxiety focused\non flashbacks, depression, and avoidance\
      \ of\nemotions, sensations, or activities that are as­\nsociated with the trauma,\
      \ even remotely. Ex­\nhibit 1.3-1 outlines some common reactions. \nCommon Experiences\
      \ and \nResponses to Trauma \nA variety of reactions are often reported and/or\n\
      observed after trauma. Most survivors exhibit \nimmediate reactions, yet these\
      \ typically resolve \nwithout severe long-term consequences. This\nis because\
      \ most trauma survivors are highly \nresilient and develop appropriate coping\n\
      strategies, including the use of social sup­\nports, to deal with the aftermath\
      \ and effects \nof trauma. Most recover with time, show min­\nimal distress,\
      \ and function effectively across \nmajor life areas and developmental stages.\n\
      Even so, clients who show little impairment\nmay still have subclinical symptoms\
      \ or symp­\ntoms that do not fit diagnostic criteria for \nacute stress disorder\
      \ (ASD) or PTSD. Only a\nsmall percentage of people with a history of \ntrauma\
      \ show impairment and symptoms that\nmeet criteria for trauma-related stress\
      \ disor­\nders, including mood and anxiety disorders. \nThe following sections\
      \ focus on some com­\nmon reactions across domains (emotional,\nphysical, cognitive,\
      \ behavioral, social, and de­\nvelopmental) associated with singular, multi­\n\
      ple, and enduring traumatic events. These \nreactions are often normal responses\
      \ to trauma\nbut can still be distressing to experience. Such\nresponses are\
      \ not signs of mental illness, nor\ndo they indicate a mental disorder. Traumatic\
      \ \nstress-related disorders comprise a specific\nconstellation of symptoms\
      \ and criteria. \nEmotional \nEmotional reactions to trauma can vary great­\n\
      ly and are significantly influenced by the indi­\nvidual’s sociocultural history.\
      \ Beyond the \ninitial emotional reactions during the event,\nthose most likely\
      \ to surface include anger, fear,\nsadness, and shame. However, individuals\
      \ may \nencounter difficulty in identifying any of these \nfeelings for various\
      \ reasons. They might lack\nexperience with or prior exposure to emotional\n\
      expression in their family or community. They \nmay associate strong feelings\
      \ with the past\ntrauma, thus believing that emotional expres­\nsion is too\
      \ dangerous or will lead to feeling out\nof control (e.g., a sense of “losing\
      \ it” or going\ncrazy). Still others might deny that they have\nany feelings\
      \ associated with their traumatic\nexperiences and define their reactions as\
      \ \nnumbness or lack of emotions. \nEmotional dysregulation \nSome trauma survivors\
      \ have difficulty regulat­\ning emotions such as anger, anxiety, sadness,\n\
      and shame—this is more so when the trauma \noccurred at a young age (van der\
      \ Kolk, Roth,\nPelcovitz, & Mandel, 1993). In individuals\nwho are older and\
      \ functioning well \n61"

      \ such emotional dysregula­\ntion is usually short lived and represents an\n\
      immediate reaction to the trauma, rather than\nan ongoing pattern. Self-medication—namely,\n\
      substance abuse—is one of the methods that \ntraumatized people use in an attempt\
      \ to regain\nemotional control, although ultimately it causes\neven further\
      \ emotional dysregulation (e.g.,\nsubstance-induced changes in affect during\n\
      and after use). Other efforts toward emotional \nregulation can include engagement\
      \ in high-\nrisk or self-injurious behaviors, disordered\neating, compulsive\
      \ behaviors such as gambling\nor overworking, and repression or denial of\n\
      emotions; however, not all behaviors \nassociated with self-regulation are considered\
      \ \nnegative. In fact, some individuals find crea­\ntive, healthy, and industrious\
      \ ways to manage\nstrong affect generated by trauma, such as \nthrough renewed\
      \ commitment to physical \nactivity or by creating an organization to sup­\n\
      port survivors of a particular trauma. \nTraumatic stress tends to evoke two\
      \ emotional \nextremes: feeling either too much (over­\nwhelmed) or too little\
      \ (numb) emotion.\nTreatment can help the client find the optimal \nlevel of\
      \ emotion and assist him or her with \nappropriately experiencing and regulating\
      \ dif­\nficult emotions. In treatment, the goal is to\nhelp clients learn to\
      \ regulate their emotions\nwithout the use of substances or other unsafe \n\
      behavior. This will likely require learning new \ncoping skills and how to tolerate\
      \ distressing\nemotions; some clients may benefit from \nmindfulness practices,\
      \ cognitive restructuring,\nand trauma-specific desensitization approaches,\n\
      such as exposure therapy and eye movement\ndesensitization and reprocessing\

      \ Martin, Davis, & Cloitre, 2009) \nthat followed the development of PTSD in\n\

      \ 22-year-old woman mandated to outpatient mental health and substance abuse\
      \ treat­\nment as the alternative to incarceration. She was arrested and charged\
      \ with assault after arguing and \nfighting with another woman on the street.\
      \ At intake, Sadhanna reported a 7-year history of alcohol \nabuse and one depressive\
      \ episode at age 18. She was surprised that she got into a fight but admit­\n\
      ted that she was drinking at the time of the incident. She also reported severe\
      \ physical abuse at the \nhands of her mother’s boyfriend between ages 4 and\
      \ 15. Of particular note to the intake worker was \nSadhanna’s matter-of-fact\
      \ way of presenting the abuse history. During the interview, she clearly indi­\n\
      cated that she did not want to attend group therapy and hear other people talk\
      \ about their feelings, \nsaying, “I learned long ago not to wear emotions on\
      \ my sleeve.” \nSadhanna reported dropping out of 10th grade, saying she never\
      \ liked school. She didn’t expect \nmuch from life. In Sadhanna’s first weeks\
      \ in treatment, she reported feeling disconnected from other \ngroup members\
      \ and questioned the purpose of the group. When asked about her own history,\
      \ she \ndenied that she had any difficulties and did not understand why she\
      \ was mandated to treatment. She \nfurther denied having feelings about her\
      \ abuse and did not believe that it affected her life now. \nGroup members often\
      \ commented that she did not show much empathy and maintained a flat affect,\
      \ \neven when group discussions were emotionally charged. \nTrauma-Informed\

      \ emo­\ntionally, there can be a tendency for family \nmembers, counselors,\
      \ and other behavioral \nhealth staff to assess levels of traumatic stress \n\
      symptoms and the impact of trauma as less \nsevere than they actually are. \n\
      Physical \nDiagnostic criteria for PTSD place considera­\nble emphasis on psychological\
      \ symptoms, but\nsome people who have experienced traumatic\nstress may present\
      \ initially with physical \nsymptoms. Thus, primary care may be the first\n\
      and only door through which these individuals\nseek assistance for trauma-related\
      \ symptoms.\nMoreover, there is a significant connection \nbetween trauma, including\
      \ adverse childhood\nexperiences (ACEs), and chronic health con­\nditions. Common\
      \ physical disorders and\nsymptoms include somatic complaints; sleep\ndisturbances;\
      \ gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,\nneurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory,\
      \ and\ndermatological disorders; urological problems; \nand substance use disorders.\
      \ \nSomatization \nSomatization indicates a focus on bodily\nsymptoms or dysfunctions\
      \ to express emotion­\nal distress. Somatic symptoms are more likely\nto occur\
      \ with individuals who have traumatic \nstress reactions, including PTSD. People\
      \ from\ncertain ethnic and cultural backgrounds may \ninitially or solely present\
      \ emotional distress via\nphysical ailments or concerns. Many individu­\nals\
      \ who present with somatization are likely \nunaware of the connection between\
      \ their emo­\ntions and the physical symptoms that they’re \nexperiencing. At\
      \ times, clients may remain\nresistant to exploring emotional content and\n\
      remain focused on bodily complaints as a\nmeans of avoidance. Some clients may\
      \ insist\nthat their primary problems are physical even\nwhen medical evaluations\
      \ and tests fail to con­\nfirm ailments. In these situations, somatiza­\ntion\
      \ may be a sign of a mental illness.\nHowever, various cultures approach emotional\
      \ \ndistress through the physical realm or view \nemotional and physical symptoms\
      \ and well­\nbeing as one. It is important not to assume \nthat clients with\
      \ physical complaints are using\nsomatization as a means to express emotional\
      \ \npain; they may have specific conditions or\ndisorders that require medical\
      \ attention.\nForemost, counselors need to refer for medical \nevaluation. \n\

      \ \n•\nEducate your clients: \n­\nFrame reexperiencing the event(s), hyperarousal,\
      \ sleep disturbances, and other physical \nsymptoms as physiological reactions\
      \ to extreme stress.  \n­ \nCommunicate that treatment and other wellness activities\
      \ can improve both psychological \nand physiological symptoms (e.g., therapy,\
      \ meditation, exercise, yoga). You may need to refer \ncertain clients to a\
      \ psychiatrist who can evaluate them and, if warranted, prescribe psycho­\n\
      tropic medication to address severe symptoms. \n­ \nDiscuss traumatic stress\
      \ symptoms and their physiological components. \n­ \nExplain links between traumatic\
      \ stress symptoms and substance use disorders, if appropriate. \n­ \nNormalize\
      \ trauma symptoms. For example, explain to clients that their symptoms are not\
      \ a\nsign of weakness, a character flaw, being damaged, or going crazy. \n•\n\
      Support your clients and provide a message of hope—that they are not alone,\
      \ they are not at\nfault, and recovery is possible and anticipated. \nCase Illustration:\

      \ how her whole life changed on that day. “I never \nfelt safe being alone after\
      \ the rape. I used to enjoy walking everywhere. Afterward, I couldn’t tolerate\
      \ \nthe fear that would arise when I walked in the neighborhood. It didn’t matter\

      \ again. It’s gotten better with time, but I often feel as if I’m sitting on\
      \ a tree limb \nwaiting for it to break. I have a hard time relaxing. I can\

      life is by comparing it to watching a scary, suspenseful movie—anxiously waiting\
      \ for something to \nhappen, palms sweating, heart pounding, on the edge of\
      \ your chair.” \nBiology of trauma \nTrauma biology is an area of burgeoning\
      \ re­\nsearch, with the promise of more complex and\nexplanatory findings yet\
      \ to come. Although a\nthorough presentation on the biological as­\npects of\
      \ trauma is beyond the scope of this \npublication, what is currently known\
      \ is that\nexposure to trauma leads to a cascade of bio­\nlogical changes and\
      \ stress responses. These \nbiological alterations are highly associated\nwith\
      \ PTSD, other mental illnesses, and sub­\nstance use disorders. These include:\
      \ \n•  Changes in limbic system functioning. \n•  Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal\
      \ axis ac­\ntivity changes with variable cortisol levels. \n•  Neurotransmitter-related\
      \ dysregulation of\narousal and endogenous opioid systems. \nAs a clear example,\
      \ early ACEs such as \nabuse, neglect, and other traumas affect brain \ndevelopment\
      \ and increase a person’s vulnera­\nbility to encountering interpersonal violence\
      \ \nas an adult and to developing chronic diseases\nand other physical illnesses,\
      \ mental illnesses,\nsubstance-related disorders, and impairment\nin other life\
      \ areas (Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, 2012). \nHyperarousal\
      \ and sleep disturbances \nA common symptom that arises from trau­\nmatic experiences\
      \ is hyperarousal (also called\nhypervigilance). Hyperarousal is the body’s\
      \ \nway of remaining prepared. It is characterized \nby sleep disturbances,\
      \ muscle tension, and a\nlower threshold for startle responses and can \npersist\
      \ years after trauma occurs. It is also one \nof the primary diagnostic criteria\
      \ for PTSD. \nHyperarousal is a consequence of biological \nchanges initiated\

      \ reflect some of the types of cognitive or thought-process changes that can\
      \ \noccur in response to traumatic stress. \nCognitive errors: Misinterpreting\
      \ a current situation as dangerous because it resembles, even re­\nmotely, a\
      \ previous trauma (e.g., a client overreacting to an overturned canoe in 8 inches\
      \ of water, as \nif she and her paddle companion would drown, due to her previous\
      \ experience of nearly drowning \nin a rip current 5 years earlier).  \nExcessive\
      \ or inappropriate guilt: Attempting to make sense cognitively and gain control\
      \ over a \ntraumatic experience by assuming responsibility or possessing survivor’s\
      \ guilt, because others who \nexperienced the same trauma did not survive. \
      \ \nIdealization:  Demonstrating inaccurate rationalizations, idealizations,\
      \ or justifications of the perpe­\ntrator’s behavior, particularly if the perpetrator\
      \ is or was a caregiver. Other similar reactions mirror \nidealization; traumatic\
      \ bonding is an emotional attachment that develops (in part to secure survival)\
      \ \nbetween perpetrators who engage in interpersonal trauma and their victims,\
      \ and Stockholm syn­\ndrome involves compassion and loyalty toward hostage takers\
      \ (de Fabrique, Van Hasselt, Vecchi, & \nRomano, 2007).  \nTrauma-induced hallucinations\
      \ or delusions: Experiencing hallucinations and delusions that, \nalthough they\
      \ are biological in origin, contain cognitions that are congruent with trauma\
      \ content \n(e.g., a woman believes that a person stepping onto her bus is her\
      \ father, who had sexually abused \nher repeatedly as child, because he wore\
      \ shoes similar to those her father once wore). \nIntrusive thoughts and memories:\
      \ Experiencing, without warning or desire, thoughts and memories \nassociated\
      \ with the trauma. These intrusive thoughts and memories can easily trigger\
      \ strong emo­\ntional and behavioral reactions, as if the trauma was recurring\
      \ in the present. The intrusive thoughts \nand memories can come rapidly, referred\
      \ to as flooding, and can be disruptive at the time of their \noccurrence. If\
      \ an individual experiences a trigger, he or she may have an increase in intrusive\
      \ \nthoughts and memories for a while. For instance, individuals who inadvertently\
      \ are retraumatized \ndue to program or clinical practices may have a surge\
      \ of intrusive thoughts of past trauma, thus mak­\ning it difficult for them\
      \ to discern what is happening now versus what happened then. Whenever \ncounseling\
      \ focuses on trauma, it is likely that the client will experience some intrusive\
      \ thoughts and \nmemories. It is important to develop coping strategies before,\
      \ as much as possible, and during the \ndelivery of trauma-informed and trauma-specific\
      \ treatment. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nserves as\
      \ a means of self-protection after \ntrauma, it can be detrimental. Hyperarousal\
      \ \ncan interfere with an individual’s ability to\ntake the necessary time to\
      \ assess and appropri­\nately respond to specific input, such as loud\nnoises\
      \ or sudden movements. Sometimes,\nhyperarousal can produce overreactions to\n\
      situations perceived as dangerous when, in\nfact, the circumstances are safe.\
      \ \nAlong with hyperarousal, sleep disturbances \nare very common in individuals\
      \ who have ex­\nperienced trauma. They can come in the form \nof early awakening,\
      \ restless sleep, difficulty \nfalling asleep, and nightmares. Sleep disturb­\n\
      ances are most persistent among individuals \nwho have trauma-related stress;\
      \ the disturb­\nances sometimes remain resistant to interven­\ntion long after\
      \ other traumatic stress \nsymptoms have been successfully treated.\nNumerous\
      \ strategies are available beyond\nmedication, including good sleep hygiene\
      \ \npractices, cognitive rehearsals of nightmares,\nrelaxation strategies, and\
      \ nutrition. \nCognitive \nTraumatic experiences can affect and alter \ncognitions.\
      \ From the outset, trauma challeng­\nes the just-world or core life assumptions\

      \ For example, it would be dif­\nficult to leave the house in the morning if\
      \ you \nbelieved that the world was not safe, that all \npeople are dangerous,\
      \ or that life holds no\npromise. Belief that one’s efforts and inten­\ntions\
      \ can protect oneself from bad things \nmakes it less likely for an individual\
      \ to per­\nceive personal vulnerability. However, trau­\nmatic events—particularly\
      \ if they are \nunexpected—can challenge such beliefs. \nLet’s say you always\
      \ considered your driving\ntime as “your time”—and your car as a safe\nplace\
      \ to spend that time. Then someone hits \nyou from behind at a highway entrance.\
      \ Al­\nmost immediately, the accident affects how \nyou perceive the world,\
      \ and from that moment \nonward, for months following the crash, you \nfeel\
      \ unsafe in any car. You become hypervigi­\nlant about other drivers and perceive\
      \ that oth­\ner cars are drifting into your lane or failing to\nstop at a safe\
      \ distance behind you. For a time, \nyour perception of safety is eroded, often\
      \ lead­\ning to compensating behaviors (e.g., excessive\nglancing into the rearview\
      \ mirror to see \nwhether the vehicles behind you are stopping)\nuntil the belief\
      \ is restored or reworked. Some \nindividuals never return to their previous\
      \ belief\nsystems after a trauma, nor do\nthey find a way to rework\nthem—thus\
      \ leading to a \nworldview that life is unsafe. \nStill, many other individuals\
      \ \nare able to return to organiz­\ning core beliefs that support\ntheir perception\
      \ of safety. \nMany factors contribute to\ncognitive patterns prior to,\nduring,\
      \ and after a trauma.\nAdopting Beck and colleagues’ \ncognitive triad model\
      \ (1979),\ntrauma can alter three main \ncognitive patterns: thoughts \nabout\
      \ self, the world (others/environment),\nand the future. To clarify, trauma\
      \ can lead\nindividuals to see themselves as incompetent\nor damaged, to see\
      \ others and the world as \nunsafe and unpredictable, and to see the future\
      \ \nas hopeless—believing that personal suffering\nwill continue, or negative\
      \ outcomes will pre­\nside for the foreseeable future (see Exhibit\n1.3-2).\
      \ Subsequently, this set of cognitions\ncan greatly influence clients’ belief\
      \ in their \nability to use internal resources and external \nsupport effectively.\
      \ From a cognitive–\nbehavioral perspective, these cognitions have a\nbidirectional\
      \ relationship in sustaining or con­\ntributing to the development of depressive\
      \ and\nanxiety symptoms after trauma. However, it is \npossible for cognitive\
      \ patterns to help protect\nagainst debilitating psychological symptoms as\n\
      well. Many factors contribute to cognitive\npatterns prior to, during, and after\
      \ a trauma. \nFeeling different \nAn integral part of experiencing trauma is\n\
      feeling different from others, whether or not \nthe trauma was an individual\
      \ or group experi­\nence. Traumatic experiences typically feel sur­\nreal and\
      \ challenge the necessity and value of\nmundane activities of daily life. Survivors\

      \ Flashbacks and Triggers \nIf a client is triggered in a session or during\
      \ some aspect of treatment, help the client focus on what is \nhappening in\
      \ the here and now; that is, use grounding techniques. Behavioral health service\
      \ provid­\ners should be prepared to help the client get regrounded so that\
      \ they can distinguish between what \nis happening now versus what had happened\
      \ in the past (see Covington, 2008, and Najavits, 2002b, \n2007b, for more grounding\
      \ techniques). Offer education about the experience of triggers and flash­\n\
      backs, and then normalize these events as common traumatic stress reactions.\
      \ Afterward, some cli­\nents need to discuss the experience and understand why\
      \ the flashback or trigger occurred. It often \nhelps for the client to draw\
      \ a connection between the trigger and the traumatic event(s). This can be \n\
      a preventive strategy whereby the client can anticipate that a given situation\
      \ places him or her at \nhigher risk for retraumatization and requires use of\
      \ coping strategies, including seeking support. \nSource: Green Cross Academy\
      \ of Traumatology, 2010. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \noften believe that others will not fully under­\nstand their experiences,\
      \ and they may think\nthat sharing their feelings, thoughts, and reac­\ntions\
      \ related to the trauma will fall short of \nexpectations. However horrid the\
      \ trauma may \nbe, the experience of the trauma is typically \nprofound. \n\
      The type of trauma can dictate how an indi­\nvidual feels different or believes\
      \ that they are \ndifferent from others. Traumas that generate \nshame will\
      \ often lead survivors to feel more \nalienated from others—believing that they\
      \ are\n“damaged goods.” When individuals believe \nthat their experiences are\
      \ unique and incom­\nprehensible, they are more likely to seek sup­\nport, if\
      \ they seek support at all, only with\nothers who have experienced a similar\
      \ trauma. \nTriggers and flashbacks \nTriggers \nA trigger is a stimulus that\
      \ sets off a memory \nof a trauma or a specific portion of a traumatic\nexperience.\
      \ Imagine you were trapped briefly \nin a car after an accident. Then, several\
      \ years\nlater, you were unable to unlatch a lock after\nusing a restroom stall;\
      \ you might have begun\nto feel a surge of panic reminiscent of the ac­\ncident,\
      \ even though there were other avenues \nof escape from the stall. Some triggers\
      \ can be \nidentified and anticipated easily, but many are\nsubtle and inconspicuous,\
      \ often surprising the \nindividual or catching him or her off guard. In\ntreatment,\
      \ it is important to help clients iden­\ntify potential triggers, draw a connection\
      \ be­\ntween strong emotional reactions and triggers,\nand develop coping strategies\
      \ to manage those \nmoments when a trigger occurs. A trigger is \nany sensory\
      \ reminder of the traumatic event: a\nnoise, smell, temperature, other physical\
      \ sensa­\ntion, or visual scene. Triggers can generalize to\nany characteristic,\
      \ no matter how remote, that\nresembles or represents a previous trauma,\nsuch\
      \ as revisiting the location where the trauma\noccurred, being alone, having\
      \ your children\nreach the same age that you were when you \nexperienced the\
      \ trauma, seeing the same breed\nof dog that bit you, or hearing loud voices.\n\
      Triggers are often associated with the time of\nday, season, holiday, or anniversary\
      \ of the event. \nFlashbacks \nA flashback is reexperiencing a previous trau­\n\
      matic experience as if it were actually happen­\ning in that moment. It includes\
      \ reactions that \noften resemble the client’s reactions during the \ntrauma.\
      \ Flashback experiences are very brief\nand typically last only a few seconds,\
      \ but the \nemotional aftereffects linger for hours or long­\ner. Flashbacks\
      \ are commonly initiated by a\ntrigger, but not necessarily. Sometimes, they\n\
      occur out of the blue. Other times, specific \nphysical states increase a person’s\
      \ vulnerability\nto reexperiencing a trauma, (e.g., fatigue, high \n68"

      \ on the client. For \nexample, hearing a car backfire on a hot, sunny \nday\
      \ may be enough to cause a veteran to re­\nspond as if he or she were back on\
      \ military \npatrol. Other ways people reexperience trau­\nma, besides flashbacks,\
      \ are via nightmares and\nintrusive thoughts of the trauma. \nDissociation,\
      \ depersonalization, and \nderealization \nDissociation is a mental process\
      \ that severs \nconnections among a person’s thoughts,\nmemories, feelings,\
      \ actions, and/or sense of \nidentity. Most of us have experienced dissocia­\n\
      tion—losing the ability to recall or track a \nparticular action (e.g., arriving\
      \ at work but not\nremembering the last minutes of the drive).\nDissociation\
      \ happens because the person is \nengaged in an automatic activity and is not\n\
      paying attention to his or her immediate envi­\nronment. Dissociation can also\
      \ occur during\nsevere stress or trauma as a protective element\nwhereby the\
      \ individual incurs distortion of\ntime, space, or identity. This is a common\n\
      symptom in traumatic stress reactions. \nDissociation helps distance the experience\
      \ \nfrom the individual. People who have experi­\nenced severe or developmental\
      \ trauma may \nhave learned to separate themselves from dis­\ntress to survive.\
      \ At times, dissociation can be \nvery pervasive and symptomatic of a mental\
      \ \ndisorder, such as dissociative identity disorder \n(DID; formerly known\
      \ as multiple personality \ndisorder). According to the DSM-5, “disso­\nciative\
      \ disorders are characterized by a disrup­\ntion of and/or discontinuity in\
      \ the normal \nintegration of consciousness, memory, identi­\nty, emotion, perception,\
      \ body representation,\nmotor control, and behavior” (APA, 2013a, p. \n291).\
      \ Dissociative disorder diagnoses are\nclosely associated with histories of\
      \ severe \nchildhood trauma or pervasive, human-caused,\nintentional trauma,\
      \ such as that experienced\nby concentration camp survivors or victims of\n\
      ongoing political imprisonment, torture, or\nlong-term isolation. A mental health\
      \ profes­\nsional, preferably with significant training in\nworking with dissociative\
      \ disorders and with\ntrauma, should be consulted when a dissocia­\ntive disorder\
      \ diagnosis is suspected. \nThe characteristics of DID can be commonly \naccepted\
      \ experiences in other cultures, rather \nthan being viewed as symptomatic of\
      \ a trau­\nmatic experience. For example, in non-\nWestern cultures, a sense\
      \ of alternate beings \nwithin oneself may be interpreted as being\ninhabited\
      \ by spirits or ancestors (Kirmayer,\n1996). Other experiences associated with\
      \ dis­\nsociation include depersonalization—\npsychologically “leaving one’s\
      \ body,” as if\nwatching oneself from a distance as an observer\nor through\
      \ derealization, leading to a sense that\nwhat is taking place is unfamiliar\
      \ or is not real. \nIf clients exhibit signs of dissociation, behav­\nioral\
      \ health service providers can use ground­\ning techniques to help them reduce\
      \ this \ndefense strategy. One major long-term conse­\nquence of dissociation\
      \ is the difficulty it causes\nin connecting strong emotional or physical \n\
      reactions with an event. Often, individuals\nmay believe that they are going\
      \ crazy because \nthey are not in touch with the nature of their\nreactions.\

      people engage in behaviors to manage the \naftereffects, the intensity of emotions,\
      \ or the \ndistressing aspects of the traumatic experience.\nSome people reduce\
      \ tension or stress through \navoidant, self-medicating (e.g., alcohol abuse),\n\
      compulsive (e.g., overeating), impulsive (e.g.,\nhigh-risk behaviors), and/or\
      \ self-injurious \nbehaviors. Others may try to gain control over\ntheir experiences\
      \ by being aggressive or sub­\nconsciously reenacting aspects of the trauma.\
      \ \nBehavioral reactions are also the consequences \nof, or learned from, traumatic\
      \ experiences. For\nexample, some people act like they can’t con­\ntrol their\
      \ current environment, thus failing to\ntake action or make decisions long after\
      \ the\ntrauma (learned helplessness). Other associate\nelements of the trauma\
      \ with current activities,\nsuch as by reacting to an intimate moment in\na\
      \ significant relationship as dangerous or un­\nsafe years after a date rape.\
      \ The following sec­\ntions discuss behavioral consequences of\ntrauma and traumatic\
      \ stress reactions. \nReenactments \nA hallmark symptom of trauma is reexperi­\n\
      encing the trauma in various ways. Reexperi­\nencing can occur through reenactments\
      \ (liter­\nally, to “redo”), by which trauma survivors\nrepetitively relive\
      \ and recreate a past trauma in\ntheir present lives. This is very apparent\
      \ in\nchildren, who play by mimicking what oc­\ncurred during the trauma, such\
      \ as by pretend­\ning to crash a toy airplane into a toy building\nafter seeing\
      \ televised images of the terrorist \nattacks on the World Trade Center on Sep­\n\
      tember 11, 2001. Attempts to understand\nreenactments are very complicated,\
      \ as reen­\nactments occur for a variety of reasons. Some­\ntimes, individuals\
      \ reenact past traumas to\nmaster them. Examples of reenactments in­\nclude\
      \ a variety of behaviors: self-injurious be­\nhaviors, hypersexuality, walking\
      \ alone in\nunsafe areas or other high-risk behaviors, driv­\ning recklessly,\
      \ or involvement in repetitive \ndestructive relationships (e.g., repeatedly\
      \ get­\nting into romantic relationships with people \nwho are abusive or violent),\
      \ to name a few. \nSelf-harm and self-destructive \nbehaviors \nSelf-harm is\
      \ any type of intentionally self-\ninflicted harm, regardless of the severity\
      \ of\ninjury or whether suicide is intended. Often, \nself-harm is an attempt\
      \ to cope with emotion­\nal or physical distress that seems overwhelm­\ning\
      \ or to cope with a profound sense of\ndissociation or being trapped, helpless,\
      \ and\n“damaged” (Herman, 1997; Santa Mina &\nGallop, 1998). Self-harm is associated\
      \ with\npast childhood sexual abuse and other forms \nof trauma as well as substance\
      \ abuse. Thus, \n70"

      \ at a local mental health center after a 2-year bout of \nanxiety symptoms.\
      \ He was an active member of his church for 12 years, but although he sought\
      \ help \nfrom his pastor about a year ago, he reports that he has had no contact\
      \ with his pastor or his church \nsince that time. Approximately 3 years ago,\
      \ his wife took her own life. He describes her as his soul-\nmate and has had\
      \ a difficult time understanding her actions or how he could have prevented\
      \ them.  \nIn the initial intake, he mentioned that he was the first person\
      \ to find his wife after the suicide and \nreported feelings of betrayal, hurt,\
      \ anger, and devastation since her death. He claimed that everyone \nleaves\
      \ him or dies. He also talked about his difficulty sleeping, having repetitive\
      \ dreams of his wife, \nand avoiding relationships. In his first session with\
      \ the counselor, he initially rejected the counselor \nbefore the counselor\
      \ had an opportunity to begin reviewing and talking about the events and dis­\n\
      comfort that led him to treatment.  \nIn this scenario, Marco is likely reenacting\
      \ his feelings of abandonment by attempting to reject others \nbefore he experiences\
      \ another rejection or abandonment. In this situation, the counselor will need\
      \ to \nrecognize the reenactment, explore the behavior, and examine how reenactments\
      \ appear in other \nsituations in Marco’s life. \naddressing self-harm requires\
      \ attention to the \nclient’s reasons for self-harm. More than like­\nly, the\
      \ client needs help recognizing and cop­\ning with emotional or physical distress\
      \ in\nmanageable amounts and ways. \nAmong the self-harm behaviors reported\
      \ in\nthe literature are cutting, burning skin by heat\n(e.g., cigarettes) or\
      \ caustic liquids, punching\nhard enough to self-bruise, head banging, hair\n\
      pulling, self-poisoning, inserting foreign ob­\njects into bodily orifices,\
      \ excessive nail biting,\nexcessive scratching, bone breaking, gnawing\nat flesh,\
      \ interfering with wound healing, tying\noff body parts to stop breathing or\
      \ blood flow,\nswallowing sharp objects, and suicide. Cutting\nand burning are\
      \ among the most common\nforms of self-harm. \nSelf-harm tends to occur most\
      \ in people who\nhave experienced repeated and/or early trauma \n(e.g., childhood\
      \ sexual abuse) rather than in\nthose who have undergone a single adult\ntrauma\
      \ (e.g., a community-wide disaster or a\nserious car accident). There are strong\
      \ associa­\ntions between eating disorders, self-harm, and \nsubstance abuse\
      \ (Claes &Vandereycken, 2007; \nfor discussion, see Harned, Najavits, & Weiss,\n\
      2006). Self-mutilation is also associated with \n(and part of the diagnostic\
      \ criteria for) a num­\nber of personality disorders, including border­\nline\
      \ and histrionic, as well as DID, depression,\nand some forms of schizophrenia;\
      \ these disor­\nders can co-occur with traumatic stress reac­\ntions and disorders.\
      \ \nIt is important to distinguish self-harm that is\nsuicidal from self-harm\
      \ that is not suicidal and \nto assess and manage both of these very serious\
      \ \ndangers carefully. Most people who engage in\nself-harm are not doing so\
      \ with the intent to\nkill themselves (Noll, Horowitz, Bonanno, \nTrickett,\
      \ & Putnam, 2003)—although self-\nharm can be life threatening and can escalate\
      \ \ninto suicidality if not managed therapeutically.\nSelf-harm can be a way\
      \ of getting attention or\nmanipulating others, but most often it is not.\n\
      Self-destructive behaviors such as substance \nabuse, restrictive or binge eating,\
      \ reckless au­\ntomobile driving, or high-risk impulsive be­\nhavior are different\
      \ from self-harming\nbehaviors but are also seen in clients with a \nhistory\
      \ of trauma. Self-destructive behaviors \ndiffer from self-harming behaviors\
      \ in that\nthere may be no immediate negative impact of\nthe behavior on the\
      \ individual; they differ \nfrom suicidal behavior in that there is no in­\n\
      tent to cause death in the short term. \n71"

      \ Who Are Self-Injurious \nCounselors who are unqualified or uncomfortable working\
      \ with clients who demonstrate self-\nharming, self-destructive, or suicidal\
      \ or homicidal ideation, intent, or behavior should work with their \nagencies\
      \ and supervisors to refer such clients to other counselors. They should consider\
      \ seeking \nspecialized supervision on how to manage such clients effectively\
      \ and safely and how to manage \ntheir feelings about these issues. The following\
      \ suggestions assume that the counselor has had suffi­\ncient training and experience\
      \ to work with clients who are self-injurious. To respond appropriately to \n\
      a client who engages in self-harm, counselors should: \n•\nScreen the client\
      \ for self-harm and suicide risk at the initial evaluation and throughout treatment.\
      \ \n• \nLearn the client’s perspective on self-harm and how it “helps.”  \n\
      • \nUnderstand that self-harm is often a coping strategy to manage the intensity\
      \ of emotional \nand/or physical distress. \n• \nTeach the client coping skills\
      \ that improve his or her management of emotions without self-harm.  \n• \n\
      Help the client obtain the level of care needed to manage genuine risk of suicide\
      \ or severe self-\ninjury. This might include hospitalization, more intensive\
      \ programming (e.g., intensive outpa­\ntient, partial hospitalization, residential\
      \ treatment), or more frequent treatment sessions. The \ngoal is to stabilize\
      \ the client as quickly as possible, and then, if possible, begin to focus treat­\n\
      ment on developing coping strategies to manage self-injurious and other harmful\
      \ impulses. \n• \nConsult with other team members, supervisors, and, if necessary,\
      \ legal experts to determine \nwhether one’s efforts with and conceptualization\
      \ of the self-harming client fit best practice \nguidelines. See, for example,\
      \ Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) 42, Substance Abuse \nTreatment for Persons\
      \ With Co-Occurring Disorders (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment \n[CSAT],\
      \ 2005c). Document such consultations and the decisions made as a result of\
      \ them thor­\noughly and frequently. \n• \nHelp the client identify how substance\
      \ use affects self-harm. In some cases, it can increase the \nbehavior (e.g.,\
      \ alcohol disinhibits the client, who is then more likely to self-harm). In\
      \ other cases, \nit can decrease the behavior (e.g., heroin evokes relaxation\
      \ and, thus, can lessen the urge to \nself-harm). In either case, continue to\
      \ help the client understand how abstinence from substances \nis necessary so\
      \ that he or she can learn more adaptive coping.  \n• \nWork collaboratively\
      \ with the client to develop a plan to create a sense of safety. Individuals\
      \ are \naffected by trauma in different ways; therefore, safety or a safe environment\
      \ may mean some­\nthing entirely different from one person to the next. Allow\
      \ the client to define what safety means \nto him or her.  \nCounselors can\
      \ also help the client prepare a safety card that the client can carry at all\
      \ times. The \ncard might include the counselor’s contact information, a 24-hour\
      \ crisis number to call in emergen­\ncies, contact information for supportive\
      \ individuals who can be contacted when needed, and, if ap­\npropriate, telephone\
      \ numbers for emergency medical services. The counselor can discuss with the\
      \ \nclient the types of signs or crises that might warrant using the numbers\
      \ on the card. Additionally, the \ncounselor might check with the client from\
      \ time to time to confirm that the information on the card \nis current. \n\
      TIP 50, Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Substance Abuse Treatment\
      \ (CSAT, 2009a), \nhas examples of safety agreements specifically for s uicidal\
      \ clients and discusses their uses in m\n \nore \ndetail. There is no credible\
      \ evidence that a safety agreement is effective in preventing a suicide at­\n\
      tempt or death. Safety agreements for clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviors\
      \ should only be \nused as an adjunct support accompanying professional screening,\
      \ assessment, and treatment for \npeople with suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\
      \ Keep in mind that safety plans or agreements may be \nperceived by the trauma\
      \ survivor as a means of controlling behavior, subsequently replicating or \n\
      triggering previous traumatic experiences.  \nAll professionals—and in some\
      \ States, anyone—could have ethical and legal responsibilities to those \nclients\
      \ who pose an imminent danger to themselves or others. Clinicians should be\
      \ aware of the \npertinent State laws where they practice and the relevant Federal\
      \ and professional regulations. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health\

      \ of Trauma \nHowever, as with self-harming behavior, self-\ndestructive behavior\
      \ needs to be recognized \nand addressed and may persist—or worsen—\nwithout\
      \ intervention. \nConsumption of substances \nSubstance use often is initiated\
      \ or increased \nafter trauma. Clients in early recovery—\nespecially those\
      \ who develop PTSD or have it \nreactivated—have a higher relapse risk if they\
      \ \nexperience a trauma. In the first 2 months \nafter September 11, 2001, more\
      \ than a quarter\nof New Yorker residents who smoked ciga­\nrettes, drank alcohol,\
      \ or used marijuana (about\n265,000 people) increased their consumption.\nThe\
      \ increases continued 6 months after the \nattacks (Vlahov, Galea, Ahern, Resnick,\
      \ &\nKilpatrick, 2004). A study by the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services\
      \ Admin­\nistration (SAMHSA, Office of Applied \nStudies, 2002) used National\
      \ Survey on Drug\nUse and Health data to compare the first three\nquarters of\
      \ 2001 with the last quarter and re­\nported an increase in the prevalence rate\
      \ for\nalcohol use among people 18 or older in the\nNew York metropolitan area\
      \ during the fourth\nquarter. \nInterviews with New York City residents who\n\
      were current or former cocaine or heroin users \nindicated that many who had\
      \ been clean for 6\nmonths or less relapsed after September 11,\n2001. Others,\
      \ who lost their income and could\nno longer support their habit, enrolled in\n\
      methadone programs (Weiss et al., 2002).\nAfter the Oklahoma City bombing in\
      \ 1995,\nOklahomans reported double the normal rate \nof alcohol use, smoking\
      \ more cigarettes, and a\nhigher incidence of initiating smoking months \nand\
      \ even years after the bombing (Smith,\nChristiansen, Vincent, & Hann, 1999).\
      \ \nSelf-medication \nKhantzian’s self-medication theory (1985) \nsuggests that\
      \ drugs of abuse are selected for \ntheir specific effects. However, no definitive\
      \ \npattern has yet emerged of the use of particu­\nlar substances in relation\
      \ to PTSD or trauma \nsymptoms. Use of substances can vary based\non a variety\
      \ of factors, including which trauma \nsymptoms are most prominent for an individ­\n\
      ual and the individual’s access to particular\nsubstances. Unresolved traumas\
      \ sometimes \nlurk behind the emotions that clients cannot \nallow themselves\
      \ to experience. Substance use \nand abuse in trauma survivors can be a way\
      \ to\nself-medicate and thereby avoid or displace \ndifficult emotions associated\
      \ with traumatic \nexperiences. When the substances are with­\ndrawn, the survivor\
      \ may use other behaviors to\nself-soothe, self-medicate, or avoid emotions.\n\
      As likely, emotions can appear after abstinence \nin the form of anxiety and\
      \ depression. \nAvoidance \nAvoidance often coincides with anxiety and\nthe\
      \ promotion of anxiety symptoms. Individu­\nals begin to avoid people, places,\
      \ or situations \nto alleviate unpleasant emotions, memories, or\ncircumstances.\
      \ Initially, the avoidance works,\nbut over time, anxiety increases and the\
      \ per­\nception that the situation is unbearable or\ndangerous increases as\
      \ well, leading to a great­\ner need to avoid. Avoidance can be adaptive,\n\
      but it is also a behavioral pattern that reinforces\nperceived danger without\
      \ testing its validity,\nand it typically leads to greater problems \nacross\
      \ major life areas (e.g., avoiding emotion­\nally oriented conversations in\
      \ an intimate rela­\ntionship). For many individuals who have\ntraumatic stress\
      \ reactions, avoidance is com­\nmonplace. A person may drive 5 miles longer\n\
      to avoid the road where he or she had an acci­\ndent. Another individual may\
      \ avoid crowded \nplaces in fear of an assault or to circumvent\nstrong emotional\
      \ memories about an earlier\nassault that took place in a crowded area.\nAvoidance\
      \ can come in many forms. When\npeople can’t tolerate strong affects associated\n\

      \ A key ingredient in\ntrauma recovery is learning to manage triggers,\nmemories,\
      \ and emotions without avoidance—\nin essence, becoming desensitized to traumatic\n\
      memories and associated symptoms. \nSocial/Interpersonal \nA key ingredient\
      \ in the early stage of TIC is\nto establish, confirm, or reestablish a support\n\
      system, including culturally appropriate activi­\nties, as soon as possible.\
      \ Social supports and\nrelationships can be protective factors against\ntraumatic\
      \ stress. However, trauma typically \naffects relationships significantly, regardless\
      \ of \nwhether the trauma is interpersonal or is of \nsome other type. Relationships\
      \ require emo­\ntional exchanges, which means that others \nwho have close relationships\
      \ or friendships \nwith the individual who survived the trauma(s)\nare often\
      \ affected as well—either through sec­\nondary traumatization or by directly\
      \ experi­\nencing the survivor’s traumatic stress reactions. \nIn natural disasters,\
      \ social and community \nsupports can be abruptly eroded and difficult\nto rebuild\
      \ after the initial disaster relief efforts \nhave waned. \nSurvivors may readily\
      \ rely on family members,\nfriends, or other social supports—or they may \n\
      avoid support, either because they believe that\nno one will be understanding\
      \ or trustworthy\nor because they perceive their own needs as a\nburden to others.\
      \ Survivors who have strong\nemotional or physical reactions, including\noutbursts\
      \ during nightmares, may pull away \nfurther in fear of being unable to predict\
      \ their\nown reactions or to protect their own safety\nand that of others. Often,\
      \ trauma survivors \nfeel ashamed of their stress reactions, which\nfurther\
      \ hampers their ability to use their sup­\nport systems and resources adequately.\
      \ \nMany survivors of childhood abuse and inter­\npersonal violence have experienced\
      \ a signifi­\ncant sense of betrayal. They have often en­\ncountered trauma\
      \ at the hands of trusted care­\ngivers and family members or through\nsignificant\
      \ relationships. This history of be­\ntrayal can disrupt forming or relying\
      \ on sup­\nportive relationships in recovery, such as peer\nsupports and counseling.\
      \ Although this fear of \ntrusting others is protective, it can lead to dif­\n\
      ficulty in connecting with others and greater\nvigilance in observing the behaviors\
      \ of others,\nincluding behavioral health service providers.\nIt is exceptionally\
      \ difficult to override the feel­\ning that someone is going to hurt you, take\
      \ \nadvantage of you, or, minimally, disappoint\nyou. Early betrayal can affect\
      \ one’s ability to\ndevelop attachments, yet the formation of\nsupportive relationships\
      \ is an important anti­\ndote in the recovery from traumatic stress. \nDevelopmental\
      \ \nEach age group is vulnerable in unique ways \nto the stresses of a disaster,\
      \ with children and\nthe elderly at greatest risk. Young children\nmay display\
      \ generalized fear, nightmares,\nheightened arousal and confusion, and physi­\n\
      cal symptoms, (e.g., stomachaches, head­\naches). School-age children may exhibit\n\
      symptoms such as aggressive behavior and\nanger, regression to behavior seen\

      \ as depression, anxiety, or another men­\ntal illness. Likewise, clients who\
      \ have \nexperienced trauma may link some of their \nsymptoms to their trauma\
      \ and diagnose them­\nselves as having PTSD, even though they do \nnot meet\
      \ all criteria for that disorder.  \nCombat Stress Reaction \nA phenomenon unique\
      \ to war, and one that \ncounselors need to understand well, is combat \nstress\
      \ reaction (CSR). CSR is an acute anxiety \nreaction occurring during or shortly\
      \ after par­\nticipating in military conflicts and wars as well \nas other operations\
      \ within the war zone, \nknown as the theater. CSR is not a formal \ndiagnosis,\
      \ nor is it included in the DSM-5 \n(APA, 2013a). It is similar to acute stress\
      \  \nNeurobiological Development: Consequences of Early Childhood Trauma \n\
      Findings in developmental psychobiology suggest that the consequences of early\
      \ maltreatment pro­\nduce enduring negative effects on brain development (DeBellis,\
      \ 2002; Liu, Diorio, Day, Francis, & \nMeaney, 2000; Teicher, 2002). Research\
      \ suggests that the first stage in a cascade of events pro­\nduced by early\
      \ trauma and/or maltreatment involves the disruption of chemicals that function\
      \ as \nneurotransmitters (e.g., cortisol, norepinephrine, dopamine), causing\
      \ escalation of the stress re­\nsponse (Heim, Mletzko, Purselle, Musselman,\
      \ & Nemeroff, 2008; Heim, Newport, Mletzko, Miller, & \nNemeroff, 2008; Teicher,\
      \ 2002). These chemical responses can then negatively affect critical neural\
      \ \ngrowth during specific sensitive periods of childhood development and can\
      \ even lead to cell death.  \nAdverse brain development can also result from\
      \ elevated levels of cortisol and catecholamines by \ncontributing to maturational\
      \ failures in other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (Meaney, \n\
      Brake, & Gratton, 2002). Heim, Mletzko et al. (2008) found that the neuropeptide\
      \ oxytocin— \nimportant for social affiliation and support, attachment, trust,\
      \ and management of stress and anxie­\nty—was markedly decreased in the cerebrospinal\
      \ fluid of women who had been exposed to child­\nhood maltreatment, particularly\
      \ those who had experienced emotional abuse. The more childhood \ntraumas a\
      \ person had experienced, and the longer their duration, the lower that person’s\
      \ current \nlevel of oxytocin was likely to be and the higher her rating of\
      \ current anxiety was likely to be.  \nUsing data from the Adverse Childhood\
      \ Experiences Study, an analysis by Anda, Felitti, Brown et al. \n(2006) confirmed\
      \ that the risk of negative outcomes in affective, somatic, substance abuse,\
      \ memory, \nsexual, and aggression-related domains increased as scores on a\
      \ measure of eight ACEs increased. \nThe researchers concluded that the association\
      \ of study scores with these outcomes can serve as a \ntheoretical parallel\
      \ for the effects of cumulative exposure to stress on the developing brain and\
      \ for \nthe resulting impairment seen in multiple brain structures and functions.\
      \  \nThe National Child Traumatic Stress Network (http://www.nctsn.org) offers\
      \ information about child­\nhood abuse, stress, and physiological responses\
      \ of children who are traumatized. Materials are avail­\nable for counselors,\
      \ educators, parents, and caregivers. There are special sections on the needs\
      \ of \nchildren in military families and on the impact of natural disasters\
      \ on children’s mental health. \nPart 1, Chapter 3—Understanding the Impact\
      \ of Trauma \nSubthreshold Trauma-\nRelated Symptoms \nMany trauma survivors\
      \ experience symptoms \nthat, although they do not meet the diagnostic\ncriteria\
      \ for ASD or PTSD, nonetheless limit\ntheir ability to function normally (e.g.,\
      \ regu­\nlate emotional states, maintain steady and\nrewarding social and family\
      \ relationships,\nfunction competently at a job, maintain a \nsteady pattern\
      \ of abstinence in recovery).\nThese symptoms can be transient, only arising\n\
      in a specific context; intermittent, appearing\nfor several weeks or months\
      \ and then reced­\ning; or a part of the individual’s regular pattern\nof functioning\
      \ (but not to the level of DSM-5\ndiagnostic criteria). Often, these patterns\
      \ are \ntermed “subthreshold” trauma symptoms. \n75"

      \ man who was severely beaten in a fight outside a bar. He had multiple injuries,\
      \ \nincluding broken bones, a concussion, and a stab wound in his lower abdomen.\
      \ He was hospitalized \nfor 3.5 weeks and was unable to return to work, thus\
      \ losing his job as a warehouse forklift operator. \nFor several years, when\
      \ faced with situations in which he perceived himself as helpless and over­\n\
      whelmed, Frank reacted with violent anger that, to others, appeared grossly\
      \ out of proportion to the \nsituation. He has not had a drink in almost 3 years,\
      \ but the bouts of anger persist and occur three to \nfive times a year. They\
      \ leave Frank feeling even more isolated from others and alienated from those\
      \ \nwho love him. He reports that he cannot watch certain television shows that\
      \ depict violent anger; he \nhas to stop watching when such scenes occur. He\
      \ sometimes daydreams about getting revenge on \nthe people who assaulted him.\
      \  \nPsychiatric and neurological evaluations do not reveal a cause for Frank’s\
      \ anger attacks. Other than \nthese symptoms, Frank has progressed well in his\
      \ abstinence from alcohol. He attends a support \ngroup regularly, has acquired\
      \ friends who are also abstinent, and has reconciled with his family of \norigin.\
      \ His marriage is more stable, although the episodes of rage limit his wife’s\
      \ willingness to com­\nmit fully to the relationship. In recounting the traumatic\
      \ event in counseling, Frank acknowledges \nthat he thought he was going to\
      \ die as a result of the fight, especially when he realized he had been \nstabbed.\
      \ As he described his experience, he began to become very anxious, and the counselor\
      \ ob­\nserved the rage beginning to appear. \nAfter his initial evaluation,\
      \ Frank was referred to an outpatient program that provided trauma-specific\
      \ \ninterventions to address his subthreshold trauma symptoms. With a combination\
      \ of cognitive– \nbehavioral counseling, EMDR, and anger management techniques,\
      \ he saw a gradual decrease in \nsymptoms when he recalled the assault. He started\
      \ having more control of his anger when memories \nof the trauma emerged. Today,\
      \ when feeling trapped, helpless, or overwhelmed, Frank has re­\nsources for\
      \ coping and does not allow his anger to interfere with his marriage or other\
      \ relationships. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nreaction,\
      \ except that the precipitating event\nor events affect military personnel (and\
      \ civil­\nians exposed to the events) in an armed con­\nflict situation. The\
      \ terms “combat stress \nreaction” and “posttraumatic stress injury” are \n\
      relatively new, and the intent of using these \nnew terms is to call attention\
      \ to the unique \nexperiences of combat-related stress as well as \nto decrease\
      \ the shame that can be associated \nwith seeking behavioral health services\
      \ for\nPTSD (for more information on veterans and\ncombat stress reactions,\
      \ see the planned TIP,\nReintegration-Related Behavioral Health Issues \nfor\
      \ Veterans and Military Families; SAMHSA, \nplanned f). \nAlthough stress mobilizes\
      \ an individual’s \nphysical and psychological resources to per­\nform more\
      \ effectively in combat, reactions to\nthe stress may persist long after the\
      \ actual \ndanger has ended. As with other traumas, the \nnature of the event(s),\
      \ the reactions of others,\nand the survivor’s psychological history and\nresources\
      \ affect the likelihood and severity of\nCSR. With combat veterans, this translates\
      \ to\nthe number, intensity, and duration of threat \nfactors; the social support\
      \ of peers in the vet­\nerans’ unit; the emotional and cognitive resili­\nence\
      \ of the service members; and the quality \nof military leadership. CSR can\
      \ vary from\nmanageable and mild to debilitating and se­\nvere. Common, less\
      \ severe symptoms of CSR\ninclude tension, hypervigilance, sleep prob­\nlems,\
      \ anger, and difficulty concentrating. If\nleft untreated, CSR can lead to PTSD.\
      \ \nCommon causes of CSR are events such as a \ndirect attack from insurgent\
      \ small arms fire or\na military convoy being hit by an improvised\nexplosive\
      \ device, but combat stressors encom­\npass a diverse array of traumatizing\

      \ of Trauma \nAdvice to Counselors: Understanding the Nature of Combat Stress\
      \ \nSeveral sources of information are available to help counselors deepen their\
      \ understanding of com­\nbat stress and postdeployment adjustment. Friedman\
      \ (2006) explains how a prolonged combat-ready \nstance, which is adaptive in\
      \ a war zone, becomes hypervigilance and overprotectiveness at home. He \nmakes\
      \ the point that the “mutual interdependence, trust, and affection” (p. 587)\
      \ that are so neces­\nsarily a part of a combat unit are different from relationships\
      \ with family members and colleagues in a \ncivilian workplace. This complicates\
      \ the transition to civilian life. Wheels Down: Adjusting to Life After \nDeployment\
      \ (Moore & Kennedy, 2011) provides practical advice for military service members,\
      \ includ­\ning inactive or active duty personnel and veterans, in transitioning\
      \ from the theater to home. \nThe following are just a few of the many resources\
      \ and reports focused on combat-related psycho­\nlogical and stress issues:\
      \  \n•\nInvisible Wounds of War: Psychological and Cognitive Injuries, Their\
      \ Consequences, and Services \nto Assist Recovery (Tanielian & Jaycox, 2008)\
      \ \n• \nOn Killing (Grossman, 1995), an indepth analysis of the psychological\
      \ dynamics of combat \n• \nHaunted by Combat (Paulson & Krippner, 2007), which\
      \ contains specific chapters on Reserve and \nNational Guard troops and female\
      \ veterans \n• \nTreating Young Veterans: Promoting Resilience Through Practice\
      \ and Advocacy (Kelly, Howe-\nBarksdale, & Gitelson, 2011) \ndie, and making\
      \ on-the-spot decisions in am­\nbiguous conditions (e.g., having to determine\n\
      whether a vehicle speeding toward a military \ncheckpoint contains insurgents\
      \ with explosives \nor a family traveling to another area). Such\ncircumstances\
      \ can lead to combat stress. Mili­\ntary personnel also serve in noncombat posi­\n\
      tions (e.g., healthcare and administrative\nroles), and personnel filling these\
      \ supportive \nroles can be exposed to combat situations by \nproximity or by\
      \ witnessing their results. \nSpecific Trauma-Related \nPsychological Disorders\
      \ \nPart of the definition of trauma is that the \nindividual responds with\
      \ intense fear, help­\nlessness, or horror. Beyond that, in both the\nshort\
      \ term and the long term, trauma com­\nprises a range of reactions from normal\
      \ (e.g.,\nbeing unable to concentrate, feeling sad, having\ntrouble sleeping)\
      \ to warranting a diagnosis of a\ntrauma-related mental disorder. Most people\
      \ \nwho experience trauma have no long-lasting\ndisabling effects; their coping\
      \ skills and the \nsupport of those around them are sufficient to\nhelp them\
      \ overcome their difficulties, and \ntheir ability to function on a daily basis\
      \ over\ntime is unimpaired. For others, though, the\nsymptoms of trauma are\
      \ more severe and last\nlonger. The most common diagnoses associat­\ned with\
      \ trauma are PTSD and ASD, but\ntrauma is also associated with the onset of\
      \ \nother mental disorders—particularly substance \nuse disorders, mood disorders,\
      \ various anxiety \ndisorders, and personality disorders. Trauma\nalso typically\
      \ exacerbates symptoms of preex­\nisting disorders, and, for people who are\
      \ pre­\ndisposed to a mental disorder, trauma can\nprecipitate its onset. Mental\
      \ disorders can oc­\ncur almost simultaneously with trauma expo­\nsure or manifest\
      \ sometime thereafter. \nAcute Stress Disorder \nASD represents a normal response\
      \ to stress.\nSymptoms develop within 4 weeks of the\ntrauma and can cause significant\
      \ levels of dis­\ntress. Most individuals who have acute stress \nreactions\
      \ never develop further impairment or\nPTSD. Acute stress disorder is highly\
      \ associ­\nated with the experience of one specific trau­\nma rather than the\
      \ experience of long-term \nexposure to chronic traumatic stress. Diagnos­\n\
      tic criteria are presented in Exhibit 1.3-3. \n77"

      \ heavy traffic can become\nanxious and avoid riding in a car or driving in\n\
      traffic for a finite time afterward. Partial am­\nnesia for the trauma often\
      \ accompanies ASD,\nand the individual may repetitively question\nothers to\
      \ fill in details. People with ASD\nsymptoms sometimes seek assurance from \n\
      others that the event happened in the way\nthey remember, that they are not\
      \ “going crazy”\nor “losing it,” and that they could not have \nprevented the\
      \ event. The next case illustration\ndemonstrates the time-limited nature of\
      \ ASD. \nDifferences between ASD and PTSD \nIt is important to consider the\
      \ differences be­\ntween ASD and PTSD when forming a diag­\nnostic impression.\
      \ The primary difference is \nthe amount of time the symptoms have been\npresent.\
      \ ASD resolves 2 days to 4 weeks after\nan event, whereas PTSD continues beyond\
      \ \nthe 4-week period. The diagnosis of ASD can\nchange to a diagnosis of PTSD\
      \ if the condi­\ntion is noted within the first 4 weeks after the \nevent, but\
      \ the symptoms persist past 4 weeks. \nASD also differs from PTSD in that the\
      \ ASD \ndiagnosis requires 9 out of 14 symptoms from \nfive categories, including\
      \ intrusion, negative\nmood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal. \nThese symptoms\
      \ can occur at the time of the \ntrauma or in the following month. Studies \n\
      indicate that dissociation at the time of trau­\nma is a good predictor of subsequent\
      \ PTSD,\nso the inclusion of dissociative symptoms \nmakes it more likely that\
      \ those who develop\nASD will later be diagnosed with PTSD\n(Bryant & Harvey,\
      \ 2000). Additionally, ASD\nis a transient disorder, meaning that it is pre­\n\
      sent in a person’s life for a relatively short time \nand then passes. In contrast,\
      \ PTSD typically \nbecomes a primary feature of an individual’s \nlife. Over\
      \ a lengthy period, PTSD can have \nprofound effects on clients’ perceptions\
      \ of\nsafety, their sense of hope for the future, their\nrelationships with\
      \ others, their physical health,\nthe appearance of psychiatric symptoms, and\n\
      their patterns of substance use and abuse. \nThere are common symptoms between\
      \ PTSD\nand ASD, and untreated ASD is a possible \npredisposing factor to PTSD,\
      \ but it is un­\nknown whether most people with ASD are \nlikely to develop\
      \ PTSD. There is some sug­\ngestion that, as with PTSD, ASD is more \n79"

      \ Sheila, a 55-year-old married woman, experienced a tornado in her home town.\
      \ In \nthe previous year, she had addressed a long-time marijuana use problem\
      \ with the help of a treat­\nment program and had been abstinent for about 6\
      \ months. Sheila was proud of her abstinence; it \nwas something she wanted\
      \ to continue. She regarded it as a mark of personal maturity; it improved \n\
      her relationship with her husband, and their business had flourished as a result\
      \ of her abstinence.  \nDuring the tornado, an employee reported that Sheila\
      \ had become very agitated and had grabbed \nher assistant to drag him under\
      \ a large table for cover. Sheila repeatedly yelled to her assistant that \n\
      they were going to die. Following the storm, Sheila could not remember certain\
      \ details of her behav­\nior during the event. Furthermore, Sheila said that\
      \ after the storm, she felt numb, as if she was float­\ning out of her body\
      \ and could watch herself from the outside. She stated that nothing felt real\
      \ and it \nwas all like a dream.  \nFollowing the tornado, Sheila experienced\
      \ emotional numbness and detachment, even from people \nclose to her, for about\
      \ 2 weeks. The symptoms slowly decreased in intensity but still disrupted her\
      \ \nlife. Sheila reported experiencing disjointed or unconnected images and\
      \ dreams of the storm that \nmade no real sense to her. She was unwilling to\
      \ return to the building where she had been during \nthe storm, despite having\
      \ maintained a business at this location for 15 years. In addition, she began\
      \ \nsmoking marijuana again because it helped her sleep. She had been very irritable\
      \ and had uncharac­\nteristic angry outbursts toward her husband, children,\
      \ and other family members.  \nAs a result of her earlier contact with a treatment\
      \ program, Sheila returned to that program and \nengaged in psychoeducational,\
      \ supportive counseling focused on her acute stress reaction. She re­\ngained\
      \ abstinence from marijuana and returned shortly to a normal level of functioning.\
      \ Her symp­\ntoms slowly diminished over a period of 3 weeks. With the help\
      \ of her counselor, she came to \nunderstand the link between the trauma and\
      \ her relapse, regained support from her spouse, and \nagain felt in control\
      \ of her life. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nprevalent\
      \ in women than in men (Bryant &\nHarvey, 2003). However, many people with\n\
      PTSD do not have a diagnosis or recall a histo­\nry of acute stress symptoms\
      \ before seeking\ntreatment for or receiving a diagnosis of PTSD. \nEffective\
      \ interventions for ASD can signifi­\ncantly reduce the possibility of the subsequent\n\
      development of PTSD. Effective treatment of\nASD can also reduce the incidence\
      \ of other \nco-occurring problems, such as depression,\nanxiety, dissociative\
      \ disorders, and compulsive \nbehaviors (Bryant & Harvey, 2000). Interven­\n\
      tion for ASD also helps the individual develop\ncoping skills that can effectively\
      \ prevent the\nrecurrence of ASD after later traumas. \nAlthough predictive\
      \ science for ASD and\nPTSD will continue to evolve, both disorders \nare associated\
      \ with increased substance use \nand mental disorders and increased risk of\
      \ \nrelapse; therefore, effective screening for ASD\nand PTSD is important for\
      \ all clients with\nthese disorders. Individuals in early recovery—\nlacking\
      \ well-practiced coping skills, lacking\nenvironmental supports, and already\
      \ operating\nat high levels of anxiety—are particularly sus­\nceptible to ASD.\
      \ Events that would not nor­\nmally be disabling can produce symptoms of\nintense\
      \ helplessness and fear, numbing and\ndepersonalization, disabling anxiety,\
      \ and an\ninability to handle normal life events. Counse­\nlors should be able\
      \ to recognize ASD and\ntreat it rather than attributing the symptoms\nto a\
      \ client’s lack of motivation to change, be­\ning “dry drunk” (for those in\
      \ substance abuse \nrecovery), or being manipulative. \nPosttraumatic Stress\

      \ of Trauma \nCase Illustration: Michael \nMichael is a 62-year-old Vietnam\
      \ veteran. He is a divorced father of two children and has four grand­\nchildren.\
      \ Both of his parents were dependent on alcohol. He describes his childhood\
      \ as isolated. His \nfather physically and psychologically abused him (e.g.,\
      \ he was beaten with a switch until he had welts \non his legs, back, and buttocks).\
      \ By age 10, his parents regarded him as incorrigible and sent him to \na reformatory\
      \ school for 6 months. By age 15, he was using marijuana, hallucinogens, and\
      \ alcohol \nand was frequently truant from school.  \nAt age 19, Michael was\
      \ drafted and sent to Vietnam, where he witnessed the deaths of six American\
      \ \nmilitary personnel. In one incident, the soldier he was next to in a bunker\
      \ was shot. Michael felt help­\nless as he talked to this soldier, who was still\
      \ conscious. In Vietnam, Michael increased his use of both \nalcohol and marijuana.\
      \ On his return to the United States, Michael continued to drink and use mari­\n\
      juana. He reenlisted in the military for another tour of duty.  \nHis life stabilized\
      \ in his early 30s, as he had a steady job, supportive friends, and a relatively\
      \ stable \nfamily life. However, he divorced in his late 30s. Shortly thereafter,\
      \ he married a second time, but \nthat marriage ended in divorce as well. He\
      \ was chronically anxious and depressed and had insomnia \nand frequent nightmares.\
      \ He periodically binged on alcohol. He complained of feeling empty, had \n\
      suicidal ideation, and frequently stated that he lacked purpose in his life.\
      \  \nIn the 1\n 980s, Michael received several years of mental health treatment\
      \ for dysthymia. He was hospital­\nized twice and received 1 year of outpatient\
      \ psychotherapy. In the mid-1990s, he r eturned to outpa­\ntient treatment for\
      \ similar symptoms and was diagnosed with PTSD and dysthymia. He no longer used\
      \ \nmarijuana and rarely drank. He reported that he didn’t like how alcohol\
      \ or other substances made him \nfeel anymore—he felt out of control with his\
      \ emotions when he used them. Michael reported symp­\ntoms of hyperarousal,\
      \ intrusion (intrusive memories, nightmares, and preoccupying thoughts about\
      \ \nVietnam), and avoidance (isolating himself from others and feeling “numb”).\
      \ He reported that these \nsymptoms seemed to relate to his childhood abuse\
      \ and his experiences in V\n ietnam. In treatment, he \nexpressed relief that\
      \ he now understood the connection between his symptoms and his history. \n\
      commonly diagnosed trauma-related disor­\nder, and its symptoms can be quite\
      \ debilitat­\ning over time. Nonetheless, it is important to\nremember that\
      \ PTSD symptoms are repre­\nsented in a number of other mental illnesses, \n\
      including major depressive disorder (MDD), \nanxiety disorders, and psychotic\
      \ disorders (Foa\net al., 2006). The DSM-5 (APA, 2013a) \nidentifies four symptom\
      \ clusters for PTSD:\npresence of intrusion symptoms, persistent\navoidance\
      \ of stimuli, negative alterations in\ncognitions and mood, and marked alterations\
      \ \nin arousal and reactivity. Individuals must\nhave been exposed to actual\
      \ or threatened\ndeath, serious injury, or sexual violence, and\nthe symptoms\
      \ must produce significant dis­\ntress and impairment for more than 4 weeks\
      \ \n(Exhibit 1.3-4). \nCertain characteristics make people more sus­\nceptible\
      \ to PTSD, including one’s unique per­\nsonal vulnerabilities at the time of\
      \ the \ntraumatic exposure, the support (or lack of\nsupport) received from\
      \ others at the time of\nthe trauma and at the onset of trauma-related \nsymptoms,\
      \ and the way others in the person’s \nenvironment gauge the nature of the traumatic\n\
      event (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). \nPeople with PTSD often present\
      \ varying clin­\nical profiles and histories. They can experience \nsymptoms\
      \ that are activated by environmental \ntriggers and then recede for a period\
      \ of time.\nSome people with PTSD who show mostly \npsychiatric symptoms (particularly\
      \ depression\nand anxiety) are misdiagnosed and go untreat­\ned for their primary\
      \ condition. For many peo­\nple, the trauma experience and diagnosis \n81"

      \ acknowledgment of the traumatic event(s). \n• \nDiscuss their initial recall\
      \ or first suspicion that they were having a traumatic response. \n• \nBecome\
      \ educated on delayed trauma responses. \n• \nDraw a connection between the\
      \ trauma and presenting trauma-related symptoms. \n• \nCreate a safe environment.\
      \ \n• \nExplore their support systems and fortify them as needed. \n• \nUnderstand\
      \ that triggers can precede traumatic stress reactions, including delayed responses\

      \ of the trauma, being reminded\nof it in some other way, or noting the anniver­\n\
      sary of an event. Likewise, combat veterans \nand survivors of community-wide\
      \ disasters \nmay seem to be coping well shortly after a\ntrauma, only to have\
      \ symptoms emerge later\nwhen their life situations seem to have stabi­\nlized.\
      \ Some clients in substance abuse recovery \nonly begin to experience trauma\
      \ symptoms \nwhen they maintain abstinence for some time.\nAs individuals decrease\
      \ tension-reducing or \nself-medicating behaviors, trauma memories \nand symptoms\
      \ can emerge. \nCulture and posttraumatic stress \nAlthough research is limited\
      \ across cultures,\nPTSD has been observed in Southeast Asian,\nSouth American,\
      \ Middle Eastern, and Native\nAmerican survivors (Osterman & de Jong,\n2007;\
      \ Wilson & Tang, 2007). As Stamm and\nFriedman (2000) point out, however, simply\
      \ \nobserving PTSD does not mean that it is the\n“best conceptual tool for characterizing\
      \ post-\ntraumatic distress among non-Western indi­\nviduals” (p. 73). In fact,\
      \ many trauma-related\nsymptoms from other cultures do not fit the \nDSM-5 criteria.\
      \ These include somatic and \npsychological symptoms and beliefs about the \n\
      origins and nature of traumatic events. More­\nover, religious and spiritual\
      \ beliefs can affect \nhow a survivor experiences a traumatic event\nand whether\
      \ he or she reports the distress. For\nexample, in societies where attitudes\
      \ toward\nkarma and the glorification of war veterans are\npredominant, it is\
      \ harder for war veterans to\ncome forward and disclose that they are emo­\n\
      tionally overwhelmed or struggling. It would\nbe perceived as inappropriate\
      \ and possibly \ndemoralizing to focus on the emotional dis­\ntress that he\
      \ or she still bears. (For a review of\ncultural competence in treating trauma,\
      \ refer\nto Brown, 2008.) \nMethods for measuring PTSD are also cultur­\nally\
      \ specific. As part of a project begun in\n1972, the World Health Organization\n\
      (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health \n(NIH) embarked on a joint study\
      \ to test the\ncross-cultural applicability of classification\nsystems for various\
      \ diagnoses. WHO and\nNIH identified apparently universal factors of\npsychological\
      \ disorders and developed specific\ninstruments to measure them. These instru­\n\
      ments, the Composite International Diagnos­\ntic Interview and the Schedules\
      \ for Clinical \nAssessment in Neuropsychiatry, include cer­\ntain criteria\
      \ from the DSM (Fourth Edition,\nText Revision; APA, 2000a) as well as criteria\n\
      from the International Statistical Classifica­\ntion of Diseases and Related\
      \ Health Prob­\nlems, 10th revision (ICD-10; Exhibit 1.3-5). \n84"

      \ and Assessment \nOnly people specifically trained and licensed in mental health\
      \ assessment should make diagnoses; \ntrauma can result in complicated cases,\
      \ and many symptoms can be present, whether or not they \nmeet full diagnostic\
      \ criteria for a specific disorder. Only a trained assessor can distinguish\
      \ accurately \namong various symptoms and in the presence of co-occurring disorders.\
      \ However, behavioral health \nprofessionals without specific assessment training\
      \ can still serve an important role in screening for \npossible mental disorders\
      \ using established screening tools (CSAT, 2005c; see also Chapter 4 of this\
      \ \nTIP). In agencies and clinics, it is critical to provide such screenings\
      \ systematically—for each client—as \nPTSD and other co-occurring disorders\
      \ are typically underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. \nMany survivors with severe\
      \ mental \ndisorders function fairly well following \ntrauma, including disasters,\
      \ as long as \nessential services aren’t interrupted. For \nothers, additional\
      \ mental health supports \nmay be necessary. For more information, \nsee Responding\

      \ Thus,\nit’s common for trauma survivors to be under-\ndiagnosed or misdiagnosed.\
      \ If they have not \nbeen identified as trauma survivors, their psy­\nchological\
      \ distress is often not associated with \nprevious trauma, and/or they are diagnosed\n\
      with a disorder that marginally matches their\npresenting symptoms and psychological\
      \ se­\nquelae of trauma. The following sections pre­\nsent a brief overview\
      \ of some mental disorders \nthat can result from (or be worsened by)\ntraumatic\
      \ stress. PTSD is not the only diag­\nnosis related to trauma nor its only psycholog­\n\
      ical consequence; trauma can broadly\ninfluence mental and physical health in\
      \ clients \nwho already have behavioral health disorders. \nPeople With Mental\
      \ Disorders \nMDD is the most common co-occurring dis­\norder in people who\
      \ have experienced trauma\nand are diagnosed with PTSD. A well-\nestablished\
      \ causal relationship exists between\nstressful events and depression, and a\
      \ prior\nhistory of MDD is predictive of PTSD after \nexposure to major trauma\
      \ (Foa et al., 2006). \nCo-occurrence is also linked with greater im­\npairment\
      \ and more severe symptoms of both\ndisorders, and the person is less likely\
      \ to experi­\nence remission of symptoms within 6 months. \nGeneralized anxiety,\
      \ obsessive–compulsive,\nand other anxiety disorders are also associated\nwith\
      \ PTSD. PTSD may exacerbate anxiety\ndisorder symptoms, but it is also likely\
      \ that\npreexisting anxiety symptoms and anxiety dis­\norders increase vulnerability\
      \ to PTSD. Preex­\nisting anxiety primes survivors for greater \nhyperarousal\
      \ and distress. Other disorders,\nsuch as personality and somatization disorders,\n\
      are also associated with trauma, but the histo­\nry of trauma is often overlooked\
      \ as a signifi­\ncant factor or necessary target in treatment. \nThe relationship\
      \ between PTSD and other\ndisorders is complex. More research is now\nexamining\
      \ the multiple potential pathways \namong PTSD and other disorders and how\n\
      various sequences affect clinical presentation.\nTIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment\
      \ for Persons \nWith Co-Occurring Disorders (CSAT, 2005c), is\nvaluable in understanding\
      \ the relationship of\nsubstance use to other mental disorders. \nPeople With\
      \ Substance Use \nDisorders \nThere is clearly a correlation between trauma\n\
      (including individual, group, or mass trauma)\nand substance use as well as\
      \ the presence of\nposttraumatic stress (and other trauma-related\ndisorders)\

      \ with PTSD often have at least one additional diagnosis of a mental disorder.\
      \ \n• \nThe presence of other disorders typically worsens and prolongs the course\
      \ of PTSD and compli­\ncates clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment.\
      \ \n• \nThe most common co-occurring disorders, in addition to substance use\
      \ disorders, include mood \ndisorders, various anxiety disorders, eating disorders,\
      \ and personality disorders. \n• \nExposure to early, severe, and chronic trauma\
      \ is linked to more complex symptoms, including \nimpulse control deficits,\
      \ greater difficulty in emotional regulation and establishing stable relation­\n\
      ships, and disruptions in consciousness, memory, identity, and/or perception\
      \ of the environment \n(Dom, De, Hulstijn, & Sabbe, 2007; Waldrop, Back, Verduin,\
      \ & Brady, 2007). \n• \nCertain diagnostic groups and at-risk populations (e.g.,\
      \ people with developmental disabilities, \npeople who are homeless or incarcerated)\
      \ are more susceptible to trauma exposure and to de­\nveloping PTSD if exposed\
      \ but less likely to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. \n• \nGiven\
      \ the prevalence of traumatic events in clients who present for substance abuse\
      \ treatment, \ncounselors should assess all clients for possible trauma-related\
      \ disorders. \nmanage traumatic stress and specific PTSD\nsymptoms. Likewise,\
      \ people with substance \nuse disorders are at higher risk of developing\nPTSD\
      \ than people who do not abuse sub­\nstances. Counselors working with trauma\
      \ sur­\nvivors or clients who have substance use \ndisorders have to be particularly\
      \ aware of the\npossibility of the other disorder arising. \nTimeframe: PTSD\
      \ and the onset of \nsubstance use disorders \nKnowing whether substance abuse\
      \ or PTSD\ncame first informs whether a causal relation­\nship exists, but learning\
      \ this requires thorough\nassessment of clients and access to complete \ndata\
      \ on PTSD; substance use, abuse, and de­\npendence; and the onset of each. Much\
      \ cur­\nrent research focuses solely on the age of onset\nof substance use (not\
      \ abuse), so determining\ncausal relationships can be difficult.\nThe relationship\
      \ between PTSD and sub­\nstance use disorders is thought to be bidirec­\ntional\
      \ and cyclical: substance use increases \ntrauma risk, and exposure to trauma\
      \ escalates \nsubstance use to manage trauma-related\nsymptoms. Three other\
      \ causal pathways de­\nscribed by Chilcoat and Breslau’s seminal work \n(1998)\
      \ further explain the relationship be­\ntween PTSD and substance use disorders:\
      \ \n1.  The “self-medication” hypothesis suggests \nthat clients with PTSD use\
      \ substances to \nmanage PTSD symptoms (e.g., intrusive \nmemories, physical\
      \ arousal). Substances \nsuch as alcohol, cocaine, barbiturates, opi­\noids,\
      \ and amphetamines are frequently \nabused in attempts to relieve or numb\n\
      emotional pain or to forget the event. \n2.  The “high-risk” hypothesis states\
      \ that \ndrug and alcohol use places people who\nuse substances in high-risk\
      \ situations that\nincrease their chances of being exposed to\nevents that lead\
      \ to PTSD. \n3.  The “susceptibility” hypothesis suggests \nthat people who\
      \ use substances are more \nsusceptible to developing PTSD after ex­\nposure\
      \ to trauma than people who do not.\nIncreased vulnerability may result from\
      \ \nfailure to develop effective stress manage­\nment strategies, changes in\
      \ brain chemis­\ntry, or damage to neurophysiological \nsystems due to extensive\
      \ substance use. \nPTSD and substance abuse \ntreatment \nPTSD can limit progress\
      \ in substance abuse \nrecovery, increase the potential for relapse, and\ncomplicate\
      \ a client’s ability to achieve success \nin various life areas. Each disorder\
      \ can mask or \nhide the symptoms of the other, and both need \n87"

      \ woman diagnosed with PTSD and alcohol dependence. From ages 8 to 12, she \n\
      was sexually abused by an uncle. Maria never told anyone about the abuse for\
      \ fear that she would \nnot be believed. Her uncle remains close to the family,\
      \ and Maria still sees him on certain holidays. \nWhen she came in for treatment,\
      \ she described her emotions and thoughts as out of control. Maria \noften experiences\
      \ intrusive memories of the abuse, which at times can be vivid and unrelenting.\
      \ She \ncannot predict when the thoughts will come; efforts to distract herself\
      \ from them do not always \nwork. She often drinks in response to these thoughts\
      \ or his presence, as she has found that alcohol \ncan dull her level of distress.\
      \ Maria also has difficulty falling asleep and is often awakened by night­\n\
      mares. She does not usually remember the dreams, but she wakes up feeling frightened\
      \ and alert \nand cannot go back to sleep.  \nMaria tries to avoid family gatherings\
      \ but often feels pressured to go. Whenever she sees her uncle, \nshe feels\
      \ intense panic and anger but says she can usually “hold it together” if she\
      \ avoids him. Af­\nterward, however, she describes being overtaken by these\
      \ feelings and unable to calm down. She \nalso describes feeling physically\
      \ ill and shaky. At these times, she often isolates herself, stays in her \n\
      apartment, and drinks steadily for several days. Maria also reports distress\
      \ pertaining to her relation­\nship with her boyfriend. In the beginning of\
      \ their relationship, she found him comforting and enjoyed \nhis affection,\
      \ but more recently, she has begun to feel anxious and unsettled around him.\
      \ Maria tries \nto avoid sex with him, but she sometimes gives in for fear of\
      \ losing the relationship. She finds it easi­\ner to have sex with him when\
      \ she is drunk, but she often experiences strong feelings of dread and \ndisgust\
      \ reminiscent of her abuse. Maria feels guilty and confused about these feelings.\

      \ treated if the individual is \nto have a full recovery. There is a risk of\
      \ misin­\nterpreting trauma-related symptoms in sub­\nstance abuse treatment\
      \ settings. For example,\navoidance symptoms in an individual with\nPTSD can\
      \ be misinterpreted as lack of moti­\nvation or unwillingness to engage in substance\
      \ \nabuse treatment; a counselor’s efforts to ad­\ndress substance abuse–related\
      \ behaviors in \nearly recovery can likewise provoke an exag­\ngerated response\
      \ from a trauma survivor who\nhas profound traumatic experiences of being\n\
      trapped and controlled. Exhibit 1.3-6 lists \nimportant facts about PTSD and\
      \ substance \nuse disorders for counselors. \nSleep, PTSD, and substance use\
      \ \nMany people have trouble getting to sleep\nand/or staying asleep after a\
      \ traumatic event; \nconsequently, some have a drink or two to\nhelp them fall\
      \ asleep. Unfortunately, any ini­\ntially helpful effects are likely not only\
      \ to wane \nquickly, but also to incur a negative rebound\neffect. When someone\
      \ uses a substance before \ngoing to bed, “sleep becomes lighter and more \n\
      easily disrupted,” and rapid eye movement\nsleep (REM) “increases, with an associated\n\
      increase in dreams and nightmares,” as the\neffects wear off (Auerbach, 2003,\
      \ p. 1185). \nPeople with alcohol dependence report multi­\nple types of sleep\
      \ disturbances over time, and\nit is not unusual for clients to report that\
      \ they \ncannot fall asleep without first having a drink.\nBoth REM and slow\
      \ wave sleep are reduced\nin clients with alcohol dependence, which is\nalso\
      \ associated with an increase in the amount \nof time it takes before sleep\
      \ occurs, decreased\noverall sleep time, more nightmares, and re­\nduced sleep\

      \ mental disorders found in clients in substance \nabuse treatment (CSAT, 2005c).\
      \ \n• \nPeople in treatment for PTSD tend to abuse a wide range of substances,\
      \ including opioids, co­\ncaine, marijuana, alcohol, and prescription medications.\
      \ \n• \nPeople in treatment for PTSD and substance abuse have a more severe\
      \ clinical profile than those \nwith just one of these disorders.  \n• \nPTSD,\
      \ with or without major depression, significantly increases risk for suicidality\
      \ (CSAT, 2009a).\nGender Differences \n•\nRates of trauma-related disorders\
      \ are high in men and women in substance abuse treatment. \n• \nWomen with PTSD\
      \ and a substance use disorder most frequently experienced rape or witnessed\
      \ \na killing or injury; men with both disorders typically witnessed a killing\
      \ or injury or were the victim \nof sudden injury or accident (Cottler, Nishith,\
      \ & Compton, 2001). \nRisk of Continued Cycle of Violence \n•\nWhile under the\
      \ influence of substances, a person is more vulnerable to traumatic events (e.g.,\n\
      automobile crashes, assaults). \n \n• \nPerpetrators of violent assault often\
      \ are under the influence of substances or test positive for \nsubstances at\
      \ the time of arrest. \nTreatment Complications \n•\nIt is important to recognize\
      \ and help clients understand that becoming abstinent from sub­\nstances does\
      \ not resolve PTSD; in fact, some PTSD symptoms become worse with abstinence\
      \ for \nsome people. Both disorders must be addressed in treatment.  \n• \n\
      Treatment outcomes for clients with PTSD and a substance use disorder are worse\

      ical importance is the vicious cycle that can\nalso begin during “slips”; relapse\
      \ initially im­\nproves sleep, but continued drinking leads to\nsleep disruption.\
      \ This cycle of initial reduction \nof an unpleasant symptom, which only ends\

      \ \nWhy screen universally for trauma in behavioral health services? Ex­\nposure\
      \ to trauma is common; in many surveys, more than half of re­\nspondents report\
      \ a history of trauma, and the rates are even higher\namong clients with mental\
      \ or substance use disorders. Furthermore,\nbehavioral health problems, including\
      \ substance use and mental dis­\norders, are more difficult to treat if trauma-related\
      \ symptoms and\ndisorders aren’t detected early and treated effectively (Part\
      \ 3, Section\n1, of this Treatment Improvement Protocol [TIP], available online,\n\
      summarizes research on the prevalence of trauma and its relation­\nship with\
      \ other behavioral health problems). \nNot addressing traumatic stress symptoms,\
      \ trauma-specific disor­\nders, and other symptoms/disorders related to trauma\
      \ can impede \nsuccessful mental health and substance abuse treatment. Unrecog­\n\
      nized, unaddressed trauma symptoms can lead to poor engagement\nin treatment,\
      \ premature termination, greater risk for relapse of psy­\nchological symptoms\
      \ or substance use, and worse outcomes.\nScreening can also prevent misdiagnosis\
      \ and inappropriate treat­\nment planning. People with histories of trauma often\
      \ display \nsymptoms that meet criteria for other disorders. \nWithout screening,\
      \ clients’ trauma histories and related symptoms \noften go undetected, leading\
      \ providers to direct services toward\nsymptoms and disorders that may only\
      \ partially explain client\npresentations and distress. Universal\nscreening\
      \ for trauma history and trauma-\nrelated symptoms can help behavioral \nhealth\
      \ practitioners identify individuals at\nrisk of developing more pervasive and\
      \ se­\nvere symptoms of traumatic stress.\nScreening, early identification,\
      \ and inter-\nvention serves as a prevention strategy. \n91"

      \ Services \nTrauma-Informed Care Framework in Behavioral Health Services—Screening\
      \ and \nAssessment \nThe chapter begins with a discussion of\nscreening and\
      \ assessment concepts, with a\nparticular focus on trauma-informed screen­\n\
      ing. It then highlights specific factors that \ninfluence screening and assessment,\
      \ including\ntiming and environment. Barriers and chal­\nlenges in providing\
      \ trauma-informed screen­\ning are discussed, along with culturally specific\n\
      screening and assessment considerations and\nguidelines. Instrument selection,\
      \ trauma-\ninformed screening and assessment tools, and\ntrauma-informed screening\
      \ and assessment\nprocesses are reviewed as well. For a more \nresearch-oriented\
      \ perspective on screening and\nassessment for traumatic stress disorders,\n\
      please refer to the literature review provided in\nPart 3 of this TIP, which\
      \ is available online. \nScreening and Assessment \nScreening \nThe first two\
      \ steps in screening are to deter­\nmine whether the person has a history of\n\
      trauma and whether he or she has trauma-\nrelated symptoms. Screening mainly\
      \ obtains\nanswers to “yes” or “no” questions: “Has this\nclient experienced\
      \ a trauma in the past?” and\n“Does this client at this time warrant further\
      \ \nassessment regarding trauma-related symp­\ntoms?” If someone acknowledges\
      \ a trauma\nhistory, then further screening is necessary to\ndetermine whether\
      \ trauma-related symptoms \nare present. However, the presence of such\nsymptoms\
      \ does not necessarily say anything\nabout their severity, nor does a positive\
      \ screen\nindicate that a disorder actually exists. Positive \n92\n\n[Page 115]\n\
      Screening is often the first contact \nbetween the client and the treatment\
      \ \nprovider, and the client forms his or her \nfirst impression of treatment\
      \ during this \nintake process. Thus, how screening is \nconducted can be as\
      \ important as the \nactual information gathered, as it sets the \ntone of treatment\
      \ and begins the \nrelationship with the client. \nPart 1, Chapter 4—Screening\
      \ and Assessment \nscreens only indicate that assessment or fur­\nther evaluation\
      \ is warranted, and negative\nscreens do not necessarily mean that an indi­\n\
      vidual doesn’t have symptoms that warrant \nintervention. \nScreening procedures\
      \ should always define the \nsteps to take after a positive or negative\nscreening.\
      \ That is, the screening process es­\ntablishes precisely how to score responses\
      \ to\nscreening tools or questions and clearly defines \nwhat constitutes a\
      \ positive score (called a “cut­\noff score”) for a particular potential problem.\n\
      The screening procedures detail the actions to\ntake after a client scores in\
      \ the positive range.\nClinical supervision is helpful—and some­\ntimes necessary—in\
      \ judging how to proceed. \nTrauma-informed screening is an essential \npart\
      \ of the intake evaluation and the treatment \nplanning process, but it is not\
      \ an end in itself.\nScreening processes can be developed that\nallow staff\
      \ without advanced degrees or gradu­\nate-level training to conduct them, whereas\
      \ \nassessments for trauma-related disorders re­\nquire a mental health professional\
      \ trained in\nassessment and evaluation processes. The \nmost important domains\
      \ to screen among\nindividuals with trauma histories include: \n•  Trauma-related\
      \ symptoms. \n•  Depressive or dissociative symptoms, sleep\ndisturbances, and\
      \ intrusive experiences. \n•  Past and present mental disorders, includ­\ning\
      \ typically trauma-related disorders (e.g.,\nmood disorders). \n•  Severity\
      \ or characteristics of a specific\ntrauma type (e.g., forms of interpersonal\
      \ vi­\nolence, adverse childhood events, combat\nexperiences). \n•  Substance\
      \ abuse. \n•  Social support and coping styles. \n•  Availability of resources.\
      \ \n•  Risks for self-harm, suicide, and violence. \n•  Health screenings. \n\
      Assessment \nWhen a client screens positive for substance \nabuse, trauma-related\
      \ symptoms, or mental \ndisorders, the agency or counselor should fol­\nlow\
      \ up with an assessment. A positive screen­\ning calls for more action—an assessment\
      \ that\ndetermines and defines presenting struggles to\ndevelop an appropriate\
      \ treatment plan and to\nmake an informed and collaborative decision \nabout\
      \ treatment placement. Assessment de­\ntermines the nature and extent of the\
      \ client’s \nproblems; it might require the client to re­\nspond to written\
      \ questions, or it could involve \na clinical interview by a mental health or\
      \ sub­\nstance abuse professional qualified to assess \nthe client and arrive\
      \ at a diagnosis. A clinical\nassessment delves into a client’s past and cur­\n\
      rent experiences, psychosocial and cultural \nhistory, and assets and resources.\
      \ \nAssessment protocols can require more than a\nsingle session to complete\
      \ and should also use \nmultiple avenues to obtain the necessary clini­\ncal\
      \ information, including self-assessment\ntools, past and present clinical and\
      \ medical \nrecords, structured clinical interviews, assess­\nment measures,\
      \ and collateral information\nfrom significant others, other behavioral\nhealth\
      \ professionals, and agencies. Qualifica­\ntions for conducting assessments\
      \ and clinical \ninterviews are more rigorous than for screen­\ning. Advanced\
      \ degrees, licensing or certifica­\ntion, and special training in administration,\n\
      scoring, and interpretation of specific assess­\nment instruments and interviews\
      \ are often \n93"

      \ Clients \n•\nAsk all clients about any possible history of trauma; use a checklist\
      \ to increase proper identifica­\ntion of such a history (see the online Adverse\
      \ Childhood Experiences Study Score Calculator \n[http://acestudy.org/ace_score]\
      \ for specific questions about adverse childhood experiences). \n• \nUse only\
      \ validated instruments for screening and assessment.  \n• \nEarly in treatment,\
      \ screen all clients who have histories of exposure to traumatic events for\
      \ psy­\nchological symptoms and mental disorders related to trauma. \n• \nWhen\
      \ clients screen positive, also screen for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (see\
      \ TIP 50, Ad­\ndressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Substance Abuse Treatment;\
      \ Center for Substance \nAbuse Treatment [CSAT], 2009a). \n• \nDo not delay\
      \ screening; do not wait for a period of abstinence or stabilization of symptoms.\
      \ \n• \nBe aware that some clients will not make the connection between trauma\
      \ in their histories and \ntheir current patterns of behavior (e.g., alcohol\
      \ and drug use and/or avoidant behavior). \n• \nDo not require clients to describe\
      \ emotionally overwhelming traumatic events in detail.  \n• \nFocus assessment\
      \ on how trauma symptoms affect clients’ current functioning.  \n• \nConsider\
      \ using paper-and-pencil instruments for screening and assessment as well as\
      \ self-report \nmeasures when appropriate; they are less threatening for some\
      \ clients than a clinical interview. \n• \nTalk about how you will use the findings\
      \ to plan the client’s treatment, and discuss any immediate \naction necessary,\
      \ such as arranging for interpersonal support, referrals to community agencies,\
      \ or \nmoving directly into the active phase of treatment. It is helpful to\
      \ explore the strategies clients \nhave used in the past that have worked to\
      \ relieve strong emotions (Fallot & Harris, 2001).  \n• \nAt the end of the\
      \ session, make sure the client is grounded and safe before leaving the interview\
      \ \nroom (Litz, Miller, Ruef, & McTeague, 2002). Readiness to leave can be assessed\
      \ by checking on \nthe degree to which the client is c onscious of the current\
      \ environment, what the client’s plan is \nfor maintaining personal safety,\
      \ and what the client’s plans are for the rest of the day. \nTrauma-Informed\
      \ Care in Behavioral Health Services \nrequired. Counselors must be familiar\
      \ with\n(and obtain) the level of training required for\nany instruments they\
      \ consider using. \nFor people with histories of traumatic life\nevents who\
      \ screen positive for possible trauma-\nrelated symptoms and disorders, thorough\n\
      assessment gathers all relevant information\nnecessary to understand the role\
      \ of the trauma\nin their lives; appropriate treatment objectives,\ngoals, planning,\
      \ and placement; and any ongo­\ning diagnostic and treatment considerations,\
      \ \nincluding reevaluation or follow-up. \nOverall, assessment may indicate\
      \ symptoms \nthat meet diagnostic criteria for a substance\nuse or mental disorder\
      \ or a milder form of \nsymptomatology that doesn’t reach a diagnos­\ntic level—or\
      \ it may reveal that the positive\nscreen was false and that there is no significant\
      \ \ncause for concern. Information from an as­\nsessment is used to plan the\
      \ client’s treatment. \nThe plan can include such domains as level of\ncare,\
      \ acute safety needs, diagnosis, disability,\nstrengths and skills, support\
      \ network, and\ncultural context. Assessments should reoccur \nthroughout treatment.\
      \ Ongoing assessment\nduring treatment can provide valuable infor­\nmation by\
      \ revealing further details of trauma\nhistory as clients’ trust in staff members\
      \ grows \nand by gauging clients’ progress. \nTiming of Screening and \nAssessment\
      \ \nAs a trauma-informed counselor, you need to\noffer psychoeducation and support\
      \ from the \noutset of service provision; this begins with\nexplaining screening\
      \ and assessment and with\nproper pacing of the initial intake and evalua­\n\
      tion process. The client should understand the \nscreening process, why the\
      \ specific questions \nare important, and that he or she may choose \nto delay\
      \ a response or to not answer a question \n94"

      \ the client’s \ntrauma, presenting psychological symp­\ntoms, and substance\

      \ prevention strategies to avoid more \npervasive traumatic stress symptoms.\
      \ \nPart 1, Chapter 4—Screening and Assessment \nat all. Discussing the occurrence\
      \ or conse­\nquences of traumatic events can feel as unsafe \nand dangerous\
      \ to the client as if the event \nwere reoccurring. It is important not to en­\n\
      courage avoidance of the topic or reinforce the \nbelief that discussing trauma-related\
      \ material \nis dangerous, but be sensitive when gathering\ninformation in the\
      \ initial screening. Initial\nquestions about trauma should be general and\n\
      gradual. Taking the time to prepare and ex­\nplain the screening and assessment\
      \ process to\nthe client gives him or her a greater sense of\ncontrol and safety\
      \ over the assessment process. \nClients with substance use disorders \nNo screening\
      \ or assessment of trauma should\noccur when the client is under the influence\
      \ of \nalcohol or drugs. Clients under the influence \nare more likely to give\
      \ inaccurate information.\nAlthough it’s likely that clients in an active \n\
      phase of use (albeit not at the assessment it­\nself ) or undergoing substance\
      \ withdrawal can\nprovide consistent information to obtain a \nvalid screening\
      \ and assessment, there is insuf­\nficient data to know for sure. Some theorists\
      \ \nstate that no final assessment of trauma or \nposttraumatic stress disorder\
      \ (PTSD) should\noccur during these early phases (Read,\nBollinger, & Sharkansky,\
      \ 2003), asserting that\nsymptoms of withdrawal can mimic PTSD\nand thus result\
      \ in overdiagnosis of PTSD and\nother trauma-related disorders. Alcohol or \n\
      drugs can also cause memory impairment that\nclouds the client’s history of\
      \ trauma symp­\ntoms. However, Najavits (2004) and others\nnote that underdiagnosis,\
      \ not overdiagnosis, of\ntrauma and PTSD has been a significant issue\nin the\
      \ substance abuse field and thus claim \nthat it is essential to obtain an initial\
      \ assess­\nment early, which can later be modified if\nneeded (e.g., if the\
      \ client’s symptom pattern\nchanges). Indeed, clinical observations suggest\n\
      that assessments for both trauma and PTSD— \neven during active use or withdrawal—appear\
      \ \nrobust (Coffey, Schumacher, Brady, & Dansky,\n2003). Although some PTSD\
      \ symptoms and\ntrauma memories can be dampened or in­\ncreased to a degree,\
      \ their overall presence or\nabsence, as assessed early in treatment, appears\
      \ \naccurate (Najavits, 2004). \nThe Setting for Trauma Screening \nand Assessment\
      \ \nAdvances in the development of simple, brief,\nand public-domain screening\
      \ tools mean that\nat least a basic screening for trauma can be\ndone in almost\
      \ any setting. Not only can cli­\nents be screened and assessed in behavioral\
      \ \nhealth treatment settings; they can also be \nevaluated in the criminal\
      \ justice system, edu­\ncational settings, occupational settings, physi­\ncians’\
      \ offices, hospital medical and trauma \nunits, and emergency rooms. Wherever\
      \ they \noccur, trauma-related screenings and subse­\nquent assessments can\
      \ reduce or eliminate \nwasted resources, relapses, and, ultimately,\ntreatment\
      \ failures among clients who have \nhistories of trauma, mental illness, and/or\
      \ sub­\nstance use disorders. \nCreating an effective screening and \nassessment\
      \ environment \nYou can greatly enhance the success of treat­\nment by paying\
      \ careful attention to how you \napproach the screening and assessment pro­\n\
      cess. Take into account the following points: \n95"

      \ Services \n•  Clarify for the client what to expect in the\nscreening and\
      \ assessment process. For exam­\nple, tell the client that the screening and\
      \ as­\nsessment phase focuses on identifying\nissues that might benefit from\
      \ treatment.\nInform him or her that during the trauma\nscreening and assessment\
      \ process, uncom­\nfortable thoughts and feelings can arise.\nProvide reassurance\
      \ that, if they do, you’ll \nassist in dealing with this distress—but also\n\
      let them know that, even with your assis­\ntance, some psychological and physical\
      \ re­\nactions to the interview may last for a few \nhours or perhaps as long\
      \ as a few days after\nthe interview, and be sure to highlight the\nfact that\
      \ such reactions are normal (Read et\nal., 2003). \n•  Approach the client in\
      \ a matter-of-fact, yet\nsupportive, manner. Such an approach\nhelps create\
      \ an atmosphere of trust, respect,\nacceptance, and thoughtfulness (Melnick\
      \ &\nBassuk, 2000). Doing so helps to normalize \nsymptoms and experiences generated\
      \ by the \ntrauma; consider informing clients that\nsuch events are common but\
      \ can cause con­\ntinued emotional distress if they are not\ntreated. Clients\
      \ may also find it helpful for\nyou to explain the purpose of certain diffi­\n\
      cult questions. For example, you could say,\n“Many people have experienced troubling\n\
      events as children, so some of my questions \nare about whether you experienced\
      \ any\nsuch events while growing up.” Demon­\nstrate kindness and directness\
      \ in equal \nmeasure when screening/assessing clients \n(Najavits, 2004). \n\
      •  Respect the client’s personal space. Cultural \nand ethnic factors vary greatly\
      \ regarding the\nappropriate physical distance to maintain\nduring the interview.\
      \ You should respect the\nclient’s personal space, sitting neither too\nfar\
      \ from nor too close to the client; let your\nobservations of the client’s comfort\
      \ level \nduring the screening and assessment pro­\ncess guide the amount of\
      \ distance. Clients \nwith trauma may have particular sensitivity \nabout their\
      \ bodies, personal space, and\nboundaries. \n•  Adjust tone and volume of speech\
      \ to suit the\nclient’s level of engagement and degree of\ncomfort in the interview\
      \ process. Strive to \nmaintain a soothing, quiet demeanor. Be\nsensitive to\
      \ how the client might hear what \nyou have to say in response to personal dis­\n\
      closures. Clients who have been trauma­\ntized may be more reactive even to\
      \ benign\nor well-intended questions. \n•  Provide culturally appropriate symbols\
      \ of\nsafety in the physical environment. These \ninclude paintings, posters,\
      \ pottery, and\nother room decorations that symbolize \nthe safety of the surroundings\
      \ to the cli­\nent population. Avoid culturally inappro­\npriate or insensitive\
      \ items in the physical \nenvironment. \n•  Be aware of one’s own emotional\
      \ responses to \nhearing clients’ trauma histories. Hearing \nabout clients’\
      \ traumas may be very painful \nand can elicit strong emotions.The client\n\
      may interpret your reaction to his or her\nrevelations as disinterest, disgust\
      \ for the cli­\nent’s behavior, or some other inaccurate in­\nterpretation.\
      \ It is important for you to\nmonitor your interactions and to check in \nwith\
      \ the client as necessary. You may also\nfeel emotionally drained to the point\
      \ that it\ninterferes with your ability to accurately lis­\nten to or assess\
      \ clients.This effect of expo­\nsure to traumatic stories, known as \nsecondary\
      \ traumatization, can result in\nsymptoms similar to those experienced by \n\
      the client (e.g., nightmares, emotional \nnumbing); if necessary, refer to a\
      \ colleague \nfor assessment (Valent, 2002). Secondary\ntraumatization is addressed\
      \ in greater detail\nin Part 2, Chapter 2, of this TIP. \n•  Overcome linguistic\
      \ barriers via an inter­\npreter. Deciding when to add an interpreter\nrequires\
      \ careful judgment.The interpreter\nshould be knowledgeable of behavioral \n\

      \ treatment \nteam. Avoid asking family members or\nfriends of the client to\
      \ serve as interpreters. \n• Elicit only the information necessary for\ndetermining\
      \ a history of trauma and the\npossible existence and extent of traumatic\n\
      stress symptoms and related disorders.\nThere is no need to probe deeply into\
      \ the\ndetails of a client’s traumatic experiences at\nthis stage in the treatment\
      \ process. Given\nthe lack of a therapeutic relationship in\nwhich to process\
      \ the information safely,\npursuing details of trauma can cause re­\ntraumatization\
      \ or produce a level of re­\nsponse that neither you nor your client is \nprepared\
      \ to handle. Even if a client wants \nto tell his or her trauma story, it’s\
      \ your job\nto serve as “gatekeeper” and preserve the \nclient’s safety. Your\
      \ tone of voice when sug­\ngesting postponement of a discussion of\ntrauma is\
      \ very important. Avoid conveying\nthe message, “I really don’t want to hear\
      \ \nabout it.” Examples of appropriate state­\nments are: \n−\n“Your life experiences\
      \ are very im­\nportant, but at this early point in our \nwork together, we\
      \ should start with \nwhat’s going on in your life currently \nrather than discussing\
      \ past experiences \nin detail. If you feel that certain past \nexperiences\
      \ are having a big effect on \nyour life now, it would be helpful for us\nto\
      \ discuss them as long as we focus on \nyour safety and recovery right now.”\
      \ \n−\n“Talking about your past at this point \ncould arouse intense feelings—even\
      \ \nmore than you might be aware of right \nnow. Later, if you choose to, you\
      \ can \ntalk with your counselor about how to \nwork on exploring your past.”\
      \ \n− “Often, people who have a history of \ntrauma want to move quickly into\
      \ the \ndetails of the trauma to gain relief. I \nunderstand this desire, but\
      \ my concern \nfor you at this moment is to help you \nestablish a sense of\
      \ safety and support \nbefore moving into the traumatic expe­\nriences. We want\
      \ to avoid retraumati­\nzation—meaning, we want to establish \nresources that\
      \ weren’t available to you \nat the time of the trauma before delv­\ning into\
      \ more content.” \n• Give the client as much personal control as \npossible\
      \ during the assessment by:  \n−\nPresenting a rationale for the interview \n\
      and its stress-inducing potential, mak­\ning clear that the client has the right\
      \ to \nrefuse to answer any and all questions.  \n− Giving the client (where\
      \ staffing per­\nmits) the option of being interviewed \nby someone of the gender\
      \ with which \nhe or she is most comfortable. \n− Postponing the interview if\
      \ necessary \n(Fallot & Harris, 2001). \n•  Use self-administered, written checklists\
      \ \nrather than interviews when possible to as­\nsess trauma. Traumas can evoke\
      \ shame, \nguilt, anger, or other intense feelings that \ncan make it difficult\
      \ for the client to report \nthem aloud to an interviewer. Clients are \nmore\
      \ likely to report trauma when they use \nself-administered screening tools;\
      \ however, \nthese types of screening instruments only \nguide the next step.\
      \ Interviews should coin­\ncide with self-administered tools to create a \n\

      \ t he screen­\ning) and to follow up with more indepth \ndata gathering after\
      \ a self-administered \nscreening is complete. The Trauma History \nQuestionnaire\
      \ (THQ) is a self-\nadministered tool (Green, 1996). It has \nbeen used successfully\
      \ with clinical and \nnonclinical populations, including medi­\ncal patients,\
      \ women who have experi­\nenced domestic violence, and people with \nserious\

      \ techniques are important skills for assessors and all other behavioral health\
      \ service pro­\nviders who interact with traumatized clients (e.g., nurses,\
      \ security, administrators, clinicians). Even if \nyou do not directly conduct\
      \ therapy, knowledge of grounding can help you defuse an escalating \nsituation\
      \ or calm a client who is triggered by the assessment process. Grounding strategies\
      \ help a \nperson who is overwhelmed by memories or strong emotions or is dissociating;\
      \ they help the person \nbecome aware of the here and now. A useful metaphor\
      \ is the experience of walking out of a movie \ntheater. When the person dissociates\
      \ or has a flashback, it’s like watching a mental movie; ground­\ning techniques\
      \ help him or her step out of the movie theater into the daylight and the present\
      \ envi­\nronment. The client’s task is not only to hold on to moments from the\
      \ past, but also to acknowledge \nthat what he or she was experiencing is from\
      \ the past. Try the following techniques:  \n1.  Ask the client to state what\
      \ he or she observes. \nGuide the client through this exercise by using statements\
      \ like, “You seem to feel very \nscared/angry right now. You’re probably feeling\
      \ things related to what happened in the past. \nNow, you’re in a safe situation.\
      \ Let’s try to stay in the present. Take a slow deep breath, relax \nyour shoulders,\
      \ put your feet on the floor; let’s talk about what day and time it is, notice\
      \ what’s \non the wall, etc. What else can you do to feel okay in your body\
      \ right now?” \n2.\nHelp the client decrease the intensity of affect. \n•\n\
      “Emotion dial”: A client imagines turning down the volume on his or her emotions.\
      \  \n• \nClenching fists can move the energy of an emotion into fists, which\
      \ the client can then re­\nlease.  \n• \nGuided imagery can be used to visualize\
      \ a safe place. \n• \nDistraction (see #3 below). \n• \nUse strengths-based\
      \ questions (e.g., “How did you survive?” or “What strengths did you \npossess\
      \ to survive the trauma?”). \n3.  Distract the client from unbearable emotional\
      \ states. \n•\nHave the client focus on the external environment (e.g., name\
      \ red objects in the room). \n• Ask the client to focus on recent and future\
      \ events (e.g., “to do” list for the day).  \n• Help the client use self-talk\
      \ to remind himself or herself of current safety. \n• Use distractions, such\
      \ as counting, to return the focus to current reality.  \n• Somatosensory techniques\
      \ (toe-wiggling, touching a chair) can remind clients of current reality.\n\
      4.\nAsk the client to use breathing techniques. \n•\nAsk the client to inhale\
      \ through the nose and exhale through the mouth.  \n• Have the client place\
      \ his or her hands on his or her abdomen and then watch the hands go \nup and\
      \ down while the belly expands and contracts. \nSource: Melnick & Bassuk, 2000.\

      \ 2011). Screening in­\nstruments (including the THQ) are includ­\ned in Appendix\
      \ D of this TIP.  \n•\nInterview the client if he or she ha\n \ns trouble \n\
      reading or writing or is otherwise unable to \ncomplete a checklist. Clients\
      \ who are likely \nto minimize their trauma when using a \nchecklist (e.g.,\
      \ those who exhibit significant \nsymptoms of dissociation or repression) \n\
      benefit from a clinical interview. A trained \ninterviewer can elicit information\
      \ that a \nself-administered checklist does not cap­\nture. Overall, using both\
      \ a self-administered \nquestionnaire and an interview can help \nachieve greater\
      \ clarity and context.  \n• Allow time for the client to become calm and \n\
      oriented to the present if he or she has very \nintense emotional responses\
      \ when recalling \nor acknowledging a trauma. At such times, \navoid responding\
      \ with such exclamations \nas “I don’t know how you survived that!” \n(Bernstein,\
      \ 2000). If the client has difficul­\nty self-soothing, guide him or her through\
      \ \ngrounding techniques (Exhibit 1.4-1), \nwhich are particularly useful—perhaps\
      \ \neven critical—to achieving a successful \n98"

      •  Avoid phrases that imply judgment about \nthe trauma. For example, don’t\
      \ say to a cli­\nent who survived Hurricane Katrina and \nlost family members,\
      \ “It was God’s will,”\nor “It was her time to pass,” or “It was \nmeant to\
      \ be.” Do not make assumptions \nabout what a person has experienced. Ra­\n\
      ther, listen supportively without imposing\npersonal views on the client’s experience.\
      \ \n•  Provide feedback about the results of the \nscreening. Keep in mind the\
      \ client’s vulner­\nability, ability to access resources, strengths,\nand coping\
      \ strategies. Present results in a\nsynthesized manner, avoiding complicated,\n\
      overly scientific jargon or explanations. Al­\nlow time to process client reactions\
      \ during\nthe feedback session. Answer client ques­\ntions and concerns in a\
      \ direct, honest, and \ncompassionate manner. Failure to deliver\nfeedback in\
      \ this way can negatively affect\nclients’ psychological status and severely\
      \ \nweaken the potential for developing a ther­\napeutic alliance with the client.\
      \ \n•  Be aware of the possible legal implications\nof assessment. Information\
      \ you gather dur­\ning the screening and assessment process \ncan necessitate\
      \ mandatory reporting to au­\nthorities, even when the client does not\nwant\
      \ such information disclosed (Najavits,\n2004). For example, you can be required\
      \ to\nreport a client’s experience of child abuse \neven if it happened many\
      \ years ago or the \nclient doesn’t want the information report­\ned. Other\
      \ legal issues can be quite com­\nplex, such as confidentiality of records,\n\
      pursuing a case against a trauma perpetra­\ntor and divulging information to\
      \ third par­\nties while still protecting the legal status of\ninformation used\
      \ in prosecution, and child\ncustody issues (Najavits, 2004). It’s essen­\n\
      tial that you know the laws in your State, \nhave an expert legal consultant\
      \ available,\nand access clinical supervision. \nBarriers and Challenges to\
      \ \nTrauma-Informed \nScreening and Assessment \nBarriers \nIt is not necessarily\
      \ easy or obvious to identify \nan individual who has survived trauma with­\n\
      out screening. Moreover, some clients may \ndeny that they have encountered\
      \ trauma and\nits effects even after being screened or asked\ndirect questions\
      \ aimed at identifying the oc­\ncurrence of traumatic events. The two main \n\
      barriers to the evaluation of trauma and its \nrelated disorders in behavioral\
      \ health settings \nare clients not reporting trauma and providers \noverlooking\
      \ trauma and its effects. \nConcerning the first main barrier, some events \n\
      will be experienced as traumatic by one person\nbut considered nontraumatic\
      \ by another. A\nhistory of trauma encompasses not only the \nexperience of\
      \ a potentially traumatic event, but\nalso the person’s responses to it and\
      \ the mean­\nings he or she attaches to the event. Certain\nsituations make\
      \ it more likely that the client\nwill not be forthcoming about traumatic\n\
      events or his or her responses to those events.\nSome clients might not have\
      \ ever thought of a\nparticular event or their response to it as trau­\nmatic\
      \ and thus might not report or even recall \nthe event. Some clients might feel\
      \ a reluctance \nto discuss something that they sense might\nbring up uncomfortable\
      \ feelings (especially \nwith a counselor whom they’ve only recently \nmet).\
      \ Clients may avoid openly discussing\ntraumatic events or have difficulty recognizing\n\
      or articulating their experience of trauma for \nother reasons, such as feelings\
      \ of shame, guilt,\nor fear of retribution by others associated with\nthe event\
      \ (e.g., in cases of interpersonal or \n99"

      \ Clients for Trauma \nTreatment providers may avoid screening for traumatic\
      \ events and trauma-related symptoms due to: \n•\nA reluctance to inquire about\
      \ traumatic events and symptoms because these questions are not a \npart of\
      \ the counselor’s or program’s standard intake procedures.  \n• \nUnderestimation\
      \ of the impact of trauma on clients’ physical and mental health.  \n• \nA belief\
      \ that treatment of substance abuse issues needs to occur first and exclusively,\
      \ before \ntreating other behavioral health disorders.  \n• \nA belief that\
      \ treatment should focus solely on presenting symptoms rather than exploring\
      \ the \npotential origins or aggravators of symptoms.  \n• \nA lack of training\
      \ and/or feelings of incompetence in effectively treating trauma-related problems\
      \ \n(Salyers, Evans, Bond, & Meyer, 2004). \n• \nNot knowing how to respond\
      \ therapeutically to a client’s report of trauma.  \n• \nFear that a probing\
      \ trauma inquiry will be too disturbing to clients.  \n• \nNot using common\
      \ language with clients that will elicit a report of trauma (e.g., asking clients\
      \ if \nthey were abused as a child without describing what is meant by abuse).\
      \  \n• \nConcern that i f disorders are identified, clients will require treatment\
      \ that the counselor or pro­\ngram does not feel capable of providing (Fallot\
      \ & Harris, 2001). \n• \nInsufficient time for assessment to explore trauma\
      \ histories or symptoms. \n• \nUntreated trauma-related symptoms of the counselor,\
      \ other staff members, and administrators.\nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral\

      \ because they are tired of being inter­\nviewed or asked to fill out forms\

      \ trauma for many \nreasons, including:\n•  Concern for safety (e.g., fearing\
      \ more abuse \nby a perpetrator for revealing the trauma). \n•  Fear of being\
      \ judged by service providers. \n•  Shame about victimization. \n•  Reticence\
      \ about talking with others in re­\nsponse to trauma. \n•  Not recalling past\
      \ trauma through dissocia­\ntion, denial, or repression (although genuine \n\
      blockage of all trauma memory is rare \namong trauma survivors; McNally, 2003).\
      \ \n•  Lack of trust in others, including behavior­\nal health service providers.\
      \ \n•  Not seeing a significant event as traumatic. \nRegarding the second major\
      \ barrier, counselors \nand other behavioral health service providers \nmay\
      \ lack awareness that trauma can signifi­\ncantly affect clients’ presentations\
      \ in treatment \nand functioning across major life areas, such as \nrelationships\
      \ and work. In addition, some \ncounselors may believe that their role is to\
      \ \ntreat only the presenting psychological and/or\nsubstance abuse symptoms,\
      \ and thus they may \nnot be as sensitive to histories and effects of \ntrauma.\
      \ Other providers may believe that a\nclient should abstain from alcohol and\
      \ drugs \nfor an extended period before exploring trau­\nma symptoms. Perhaps\
      \ you fear that address­\ning a clients’ trauma history will only \nexacerbate\
      \ symptoms and complicate treat­\nment. Behavioral health service providers\
      \ who\nhold biases may assume that a client doesn’t \nhave a history of trauma\
      \ and thus fail to ask\nthe “right” questions, or they may be uncom­\nfortable\
      \ with emotions that arise from listen­\ning to client experiences and, as a\
      \ result,\nredirect the screening or counseling focus. \nChallenges \nAwareness\
      \ of acculturation and \nlanguage \nAcculturation levels can affect screening\
      \ and\nassessment results.Therefore, indepth discus­\nsions may be a more appropriate\
      \ way to gain an \nunderstanding of trauma from the client’s point\nof view.\

      \ 326 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 123]\nCommon Assessment Myths \nSeveral common myths\
      \ contribute to underassessment of trauma-related disorders (Najavits, 2004):\
      \ \n•\nMyth #1: Substance abuse itself is a trauma. However devastating substance\
      \ abuse is, it does \nnot meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\
      \ Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5; \nAmerican Psychiatric Association [APA],\
      \ 2013a), criteria for trauma per se. Nevertheless, high-risk \nbehaviors that\
      \ are more likely to occur during addiction, such as interpersonal violence\
      \ and self-\nharm, significantly increase the potential for traumatic injury.\
      \ \n• \nMyth #2: Assessment of trauma is enough. Thorough assessment is the\
      \ best way to identify the \nexistence and extent of trauma-related problems.\
      \ However, simply identifying trauma-related \nsymptoms and disorders is just\
      \ the first step. Also needed are individualized treatment protocols \nand action\
      \ to implement these protocols. \n• \nMyth #3: It is best to wait until the\
      \ client has ended substance use and withdrawal to assess \nfor PTSD. Research\
      \ does not provide a clear answer to the controversial question of when to as­\n\
      sess for PTSD; however, Najavits (2004) and others note that underdiagnosis\
      \ of trauma and PTSD \nhas been more significant in the substance abuse field\
      \ than overdiagnosis. Clinical experience \nshows that the PTSD diagnosis is\
      \ rather stable during substance use or withdrawal, but symptoms \ncan become\
      \ more or less intense; memory impairment from alcohol or drugs can also cloud\
      \ the \nsymptom picture. Thus, it is advisable to establish a tentative diagnosis\
      \ and then reassess after a \nperiod of abstinence, if possible. \nPart 1, Chapter\
      \ 4—Screening and Assessment \nmigration, if applicable, and primary language.\n\
      Questions about the client’s country of birth,\nlength of time in this country,\
      \ events or reasons \nfor migration, and ethnic self-identification are\nalso\
      \ appropriate at intake. Also be aware that\neven individuals who speak English\
      \ well might\nhave trouble understanding the subtleties of\nquestions on standard\
      \ screening and assessment\ntools. It is not adequate to translate items simp­\n\
      ly from English into another language; words,\nidioms, and examples often don’t\
      \ translate di­\nrectly into other languages and therefore need\nto be adapted.\
      \ Screening and assessment should\nbe conducted in the client’s preferred language\
      \ \nby trained staff members who speak the lan­\nguage or by professional translators\
      \ familiar\nwith treatment jargon. \nAwareness of co-occurring diagnoses \n\
      A trauma-informed assessor looks for psycho­\nlogical symptoms that are associated\
      \ with\ntrauma or simply occur alongside it. Symptom \nscreening involves questions\
      \ about past or\npresent mental disorder symptoms that may \nindicate the need\
      \ for a full mental health as­\nsessment. A variety of screening tools are \n\
      available, including symptom checklists. \nHowever, you should only use symptom\
      \ \nchecklists when you need information about\nhow your client is currently\
      \ feeling; don’t use \nthem to screen for specific disorders. Responses\nwill\
      \ likely change from one administration of \nthe checklist to the next. \nBasic\
      \ mental health screening tools are availa­\nble. For example, the Mental Health\
      \ Screening\nForm-III screens for present or past symptoms \nof most mental\
      \ disorders (Carroll & McGinley,\n2001); it is available at no charge from Project\n\
      Return Foundation, Inc. and is also reproduced\nin TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment\
      \ for Per­\nsons With Co-Occurring Disorders (CSAT, \n2005c). Other screening\
      \ tools, such as the Beck \nDepression Inventory II and the Beck Anxiety \n\
      Inventory (Beck, Wright, Newman, & Liese,\n1993), also screen broadly for mental\
      \ and sub­\nstance use disorders, as well as for specific dis­\norders often\
      \ associated with trauma. For \nfurther screening information and resources\
      \ on\ndepression and suicide, see TIP 48, Managing \nDepressive Symptoms in\
      \ Substance Abuse Clients \nDuring Early Recovery (CSAT, 2008), and TIP \n50,\
      \ Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\nin Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT,\
      \ 2009a). \n101"

      \ and TIP 51, Substance \nAbuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs\nof\
      \ Women (CSAT, 2009d). \nA common dilemma in the assessment of \ntrauma-related\
      \ disorders is that certain trauma \nsymptoms are also symptoms of other disor­\n\
      ders. Clients with histories of trauma typically\npresent a variety of symptoms;\
      \ thus, it is im­\nportant to determine the full scope of symp­\ntoms and/or\
      \ disorders present to help improve \ntreatment planning. Clients with trauma-\n\
      related and substance use symptoms and dis­\norders are at increased risk for\
      \ additional Axis \nI and/or Axis II mental disorders (Brady,\nKilleen, Saladin,\
      \ Dansky, & Becker, 1994;\nCottler, Nishith, & Compton, 2001). These\nsymptoms\
      \ need to be distinguished so that\nother presenting subclinical features or\
      \ disor­\nders do not go unidentified and untreated. To\naccomplish this, a\
      \ comprehensive assessment\nof the client’s mental health is recommended. \n\
      Misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis \nMany trauma survivors are either misdiagnosed\n\
      (i.e., given diagnoses that are not accurate) or\nunderdiagnosed (i.e., have\
      \ one or more diagno­\nses that have not been identified at all). Such\ndiagnostic\
      \ errors could result, in part, from the \nfact that many general instruments\
      \ to evaluate \nmental disorders are not sufficiently sensitive to\nidentify\
      \ posttraumatic symptoms and can mis-\nclassify them as other disorders, including\
      \ per­\nsonality disorders or psychoses. Intrusive\nposttraumatic symptoms,\
      \ for example, can\nshow up on general measures as indicative of \nhallucinations\
      \ or obsessions. Dissociative \nsymptoms can be interpreted as indicative of\n\
      schizophrenia. Trauma-based cognitive symp­\ntoms can be scored as evidence\
      \ for paranoia or\nother delusional processes (Briere, 1997). Some \nof the\
      \ most common misdiagnoses in clients \nwith PTSD and substance abuse are: \n\
      •  Mood and anxiety disorders. Overlapping\nsymptoms with such disorders as\
      \ major de­\npression, generalized anxiety disorder, and\nbipolar disorder can\
      \ lead to misdiagnosis. \n•  Borderline personality disorder. Historically,\n\
      this has been more frequently diagnosed\nthan PTSD. Many of the symptoms, in­\n\
      cluding a pattern of intense interpersonal \nrelationships, impulsivity, rapid\
      \ and unpre­\ndictable mood swings, power struggles in\nthe treatment environment,\
      \ underlying\nanxiety and depressive symptoms, and tran­\nsient, stress-related\
      \ paranoid ideation or se­\nvere dissociative symptoms overlap. The \neffect\
      \ of this misdiagnosis on treatment can\nbe particularly negative; counselors\
      \ often\nview clients with a borderline personality \ndiagnosis as difficult\
      \ to treat and unrespon­\nsive to treatment. \n•  Antisocial personality disorder.\
      \ For men and \nwomen who have been traumatized in \nchildhood, “acting out”\
      \ behaviors, a lack of\nempathy and conscience, impulsivity, and\nself-centeredness\
      \ can be functions of trau­\nma and survival skills rather than true anti­\n\
      social characteristics. \n•  Attention def icit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD).\
      \ For children and adolescents,\nimpulsive behaviors and concentration\nproblems\
      \ can be diagnosed as ADHD ra­\nther than PTSD. \nIt is possible, however, for\
      \ clients to legiti­\nmately have any of these disorders in addition\nto trauma-related\
      \ disorders. Given the overlap\nof posttraumatic symptoms with those of oth­\n\
      er disorders, a wide variety of diagnoses often\nneeds to be considered to avoid\
      \ misidentifying \n102"

      \ concepts of distress exist that don’t necessarily match diagnostic criteria.\
      \ Culture-\nspecific symptoms and syndromes can involve physical complaints,\
      \ broad emotional reactions, or \nspecific cognitive features. Many such syndromes\
      \ are unique to a specific culture but can broaden to \ncultures that have similar\
      \ beliefs or characteristics. Culture-bound syndromes are typically treated\
      \ by \ntraditional medicine and are known throughout the culture. Cultural concepts\
      \ of distress include: \n•\nAtaques de nervios. Recognized in Latin America\
      \ and among individuals of Latino descent, the  \nprimary features of this syndrome\
      \ include intense emotional upset (e.g., shouting, crying, trem­\nbling, dissociative\
      \ or seizure-like episodes). It frequently occurs in response to a traumatic\
      \ or \nstressful event in the family. \n• \nNervios. This is considered a common\
      \ idiom of distress among Latinos; it includes a wide range \nof emotional distress\
      \ symptoms including headaches, nervousness, tearfulness, stomach discom­\n\
      fort, difficulty sleeping, and dizziness. Symptoms can vary widely in intensity,\
      \ as can impairment \nfrom them. This often occurs in response to stressful\
      \ or difficult life events. \n• \nSusto.  This term, meaning “fright,” refers\
      \ to a concept found in Latin American cultures, but it is \nnot recognized\
      \ among Latinos from the Caribbean. Susto is attributed to a traumatic or frighten­\n\
      ing event that causes the soul to leave the body, thus resulting in illness\
      \ and unhappiness; ex­\ntreme cases may result in death. Symptoms include appetite\
      \ or sleep disturbances, sadness, lack \nof motivation, low self-esteem, and\
      \ somatic symptoms. \n• \nTaijin kyofusho. Recognized in Japan and among some\
      \ American Japanese, this “interpersonal \nfear” syndrome is characterized by\
      \ anxiety about and avoidance of interpersonal circumstances. \nThe individual\
      \ presents worry or a conviction that his or her appearance or social interactions\
      \ are \ninadequate or offensive. Other cultures have similar cultural descriptions\

      \ must be considered in screening\nand assessment (for review of assessment\
      \ and\ncultural considerations when working with\ntrauma, see Wilson & Tang,\

      \ firmly in\nmind. Cultural factors, such as norms for ex­\npressing psychological\
      \ distress, defining trau­\nma, and seeking help in dealing with trauma, \n\
      can affect: \n•  How traumas are experienced. \n•  The meaning assigned to the\

      \ Instruments \nThe recent publication of the DSM-5 (APA, 2013a) reflects changes\
      \ to certain diagnostic criteria, \nwhich will affect screening tools and criteria\
      \ for trauma-related disorders. Criterion A2 (specific to \ntraumatic stress\
      \ disorders, acute stress, and posttraumatic stress disorders), included in\
      \ the fourth \nedition (text revision) of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR; APA, 2000a), has\
      \ been eliminated; this criterion stated \nthat the individual’s response to\
      \ the trauma needs to involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror. \nThere\
      \ are now four cluster symptoms, not three: reexperiencing, avoidance, arousal,\
      \ and persistent \nnegative alterations in cognitions and mood. Changes to the\
      \ DSM-5 were made to symptoms within \neach cluster. Thus, screening will need\
      \ modification to adjust to this change (APA, 2012b). \nTrauma-Informed Care\
      \ in Behavioral Health Services \nwhenever possible, instruments that are cul­\n\
      turally appropriate for the client. Instruments \nthat have been normed for,\
      \ adapted to, and\ntested on specific cultural and linguistic groups \nshould\
      \ be used. Instruments that are not \nnormed for the population are likely to\
      \ con­\ntain cultural biases and produce misleading\nresults. Subsequently,\
      \ this can lead to misdiag­\nnosis, overdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment\n\
      plans, and ineffective interventions. Thus, it is \nimportant to interpret all\
      \ test results cautious­\nly and to discuss the limitations of instruments \n\
      with clients from diverse ethnic populations\nand cultures. For a review of\
      \ cross-cultural \nscreening and assessment considerations, refer\nto the planned\
      \ TIP, Improving Cultural Com­\npetence (Substance Abuse and Mental Health\n\
      Services Administration, planned c). \nChoosing Instruments \nNumerous instruments\
      \ screen for trauma his­\ntory, indicate symptoms, assess trauma-related\nand\
      \ other mental disorders, and identify relat­\ned clinical phenomena, such as\
      \ dissociation.\nOne instrument is unlikely to meet all screen­\ning or assessment\
      \ needs or to determine the \nexistence and full extent of trauma symptoms\n\
      and traumatic experiences. The following sec­\ntions present general considerations\
      \ in select­\ning standardized instruments. \nPurpose \nDefine your assessment\
      \ needs. Do you need a\nstandardized screening or assessment instru­\nment for\
      \ clinical purposes? Do you need in­\nformation on a specific aspect of trauma,\
      \ such\nas history, PTSD, or dissociation? Do you\nwish to make a formal diagnosis,\
      \ such as \nPTSD? Do you need to determine quickly \nwhether a client has experienced\
      \ a trauma? Do\nyou want an assessment that requires a clini­\ncian to administer\
      \ it, or can the client com­\nplete the instrument himself or herself? Does\
      \ \nthe instrument match the current and specific\ndiagnostic criteria established\
      \ in the DSM-5? \nPopulation \nConsider the population to be assessed (e.g.,\n\
      women, children, adolescents, refugees, disaster\nsurvivors, survivors of physical\
      \ or sexual vio­\nlence, survivors of combat-related trauma, peo­\nple whose\
      \ native language is not English); \nsome tools are appropriate only for certain\n\
      populations. Is the assessment process devel­\nopmentally and culturally appropriate\
      \ for your\nclient? Exhibit 1.4-2 lists considerations in \nchoosing a screening\
      \ or assessment instrument\nfor trauma and/or PTSD. \nInstrument Quality \n\
      An instrument should be psychometrically \nadequate in terms of sensitivity\
      \ and specificity \nor reliability and validity as measured in sever­\nal ways\
      \ under varying conditions. Published\nresearch offers information on an instrument’s\
      \ \npsychometric properties as well as its utility in\nboth research and clinical\
      \ settings. For further\ninformation on a number of widely used\ntrauma evaluation\
      \ tools, see Appendix D and\nAntony, Orsillo, and Roemer’s paper (2001). \n\

      \ and Assessment  \nTrauma \nKey question: Did the client experience a trauma?\
      \ \nExamples of measures: Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (Wolfe & Kimerling,\
      \ 1997); Trauma History \nQuestionnaire (Green, 1996); Traumatic Life Events\
      \ Questionnaire (Kubany et al., 2000). \nNote: A good trauma measure identifies\
      \ events a person experienced (e.g., rape, assault, accident) \nand also evaluates\
      \ other trauma-related symptoms (e.g., presence of fear, helplessness, or horror).\
      \ \nAcute Stress Disorder (ASD) and PTSD \nKey question: Does the client meet\
      \ criteria for ASD or PTSD? \nExamples of measures: Clinician-Administered PTSD\
      \ Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1990); Modified PTSD \nSymptom Scale (Falsetti,\
      \ Resnick, Resnick, & Kilpatrick, 1993); PTSD Checklist (Weathers, Litz, \n\
      Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993); Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire\
      \ (Cardena, Koopman, \nClassen, Waelde, & Spiegel, 2000). \nNote: A PTSD diagnosis\
      \ requires the person to meet criteria for having experienced a trauma; some\
      \ \nmeasures include this, but others do not and require use of a separate trauma\
      \ measure. The CAPS is \nan interview; the others listed are self-report questionnaires\
      \ and take less time. \nOther Trauma-Related Symptoms \nKey question: Does the\
      \ client have other symptoms related to trauma? These include depressive \n\
      symptoms, self-harm, dissociation, sexuality problems, and relationship issues,\
      \ such as distrust. \nExamples of measures: Beck Depression Inventory II (Beck,\
      \ 1993; Beck et al., 1993); Dissociative \nExperiences Scale (Bernstein & Putnam,\
      \ 1986; Carlson & Putnam, 1993); Impact of Event Scale \n(measures intrusion\
      \ and avoidance due to exposure to traumatic events; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez,\
      \ \n1979; Weiss & Marmar, 1997); Trauma Symptom Inventory (Briere, 1995); Trauma\
      \ Symptom Checklist \nfor Children (Briere, 1996b); Modified PTSD Symptom Scale\
      \ (Falsetti et al., 1993). \nNote: These measures can be helpful for clinical\
      \ purposes and for outcome assessment because they \ngauge levels of symptoms.\
      \ Trauma-related symptoms are broader than diagnostic criteria and thus \nuseful\
      \ to measure, even if the patient doesn’t meet criteria for any specific diagnoses.\
      \ \nOther Trauma-Related Diagnoses \nKey question: Does the client have other\
      \ disorders related to trauma? These include mood disor­\nders, anxiety disorders\
      \ besides traumatic stress disorders, and dissociative disorders. \nExamples\
      \ of measures: Mental Health Screening Form III (Carroll & McGinley, 2001);\
      \ The Mini-\nInternational Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) Structured\
      \ Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR, Pa­\ntient Edition (First, Spitzer, Gibbon,\
      \ & Williams, revised 2011); Structured Clinical Interview for DSM­\nIV-TR,\
      \ Non-Patient Edition (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, revised 2011a). \n\
      Note: For complex symptoms and diagnoses such as dissociation and dissociative\
      \ disorders, inter­\nviews are recommended. Look for measures that incorporate\
      \ DSM-5 criteria. \nSources: Antony et al., 2001; Najavits, 2004. \nPart 1,\

      \ Services \nPractical Issues \nIs the instrument freely and readily available,\n\
      or is there a fee? Is costly and extensive train­\ning required to administer\
      \ it? Is the instru­\nment too lengthy to be used in the clinical \nsetting?\
      \ Is it easily administered and scored\nwith accompanying manuals and/or other\n\
      training materials? How will results be pre­\nsented to or used with the client?\
      \ Is technical \nsupport available for difficulties in administra­\ntion, scoring,\
      \ or interpretation of results? Is \nspecial equipment required such as a micro­\n\
      phone, a video camera, or a touch-screen com­\nputer with audio? \nTrauma-Informed\
      \ \nScreening and Assessment \nThe following sections focus on initial screen­\n\
      ing. For more information on screening and\nassessment tools, including structured\
      \ inter­\nviews, see Exhibit 1.4-2. Screening is only as \ngood as the actions\
      \ taken afterward to address \na positive screen (when clients acknowledge\n\
      that they experience symptoms or have en­\ncountered events highlighted within\
      \ the\nscreening). Once a screening is complete and a\npositive screen is acquired,\
      \ the client then\nneeds referral for a more indepth assessment\nto ensure development\
      \ of an appropriate\ntreatment plan that matches his or her pre­\nsenting problems.\
      \ \nEstablish a History of Trauma \nA person cannot have ASD, PTSD, or any\n\
      trauma-related symptoms without experienc­\ning trauma; therefore, it is necessary\
      \ to inquire \nabout painful, difficult, or overwhelming past\nexperiences.\
      \ Initial information should be \ngathered in a way that is minimally intrusive\
      \ \nyet clear. Brief questionnaires can be less \nthreatening to a client than\
      \ face-to-face inter­\nviews, but interviews should be an integral \npart of\
      \ any screening and assessment process. \nIf the client initially denies a history\
      \ of trauma\n(or minimizes it), administer the questionnaire \nlater or delay\
      \ additional trauma-related ques­\ntions until the client has perhaps developed\n\
      more trust in the treatment setting and feels \nsafer with the thoughts and\
      \ emotions that \nmight arise in discussing his or her trauma\nexperiences.\
      \ \nThe Stressful Life Experiences (SLE) screen\n(Exhibit 1.4-3) is a checklist\
      \ of traumas that\nalso considers the client’s view of the impact \nof those\
      \ events on life functioning. Using the \nSLE can foster the client–counselor\
      \ relation­\nship. By going over the answers with the cli­\nent, you can gain\
      \ a deep understanding of your\nclient, and the client receives a demonstration\n\
      of your sensitivity and concern for what the\nclient has experienced. The National\
      \ Center\nfor PTSD Web site offers similar instruments \n(http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/pages/as\n\
      sessments/assessment.asp). \nIn addition to broad screening tools that cap­\n\
      ture various traumatic experiences and symp­\ntoms, other screening tools, such\
      \ as the \nCombat Exposure Scale (Keane et al., 1989)\nand the Intimate Partner\
      \ Violence Screening\nTool (Exhibit 1.4-4), focus on acknowledging\na specific\
      \ type of traumatic event. \nScreen for Trauma-Related \nSymptoms and Disorders\
      \ in \nClients With Histories of Trauma \nThis step evaluates whether the client’s\
      \ trauma \nresulted in subclinical or diagnosable disor­\nders. The counselor\
      \ can ask such questions as,\n“Have you received any counseling or therapy?\n\
      Have you ever been diagnosed or treated for a\npsychological disorder in the\
      \ past? Have you \never been prescribed medications for your\nemotions in the\
      \ past?” Screening is typically \nconducted by a wide variety of behavioral\n\
      health service providers with different levels\nof training and education; however,\

      The SPAN instrument is a brief screening tool \nthat asks clients to identify\
      \ the trauma in their \npast that is most disturbing to them currently. \nIt\
      \ then poses four questions that ask clients to  \nrate the frequency and severity\
      \ with which they \nhave experienced, in the past week, different \ntypes of\
      \ trauma-related symptoms (startle, \nphysiological arousal, anger, and numbness).\
      \  \nTo order this screening instrument, use the \nfollowing contact information:\

      \ Care in Behavioral Health Services \nindividuals who administer screenings,\
      \ regard­\nless of education level and experience, should\nbe aware of trauma-related\
      \ symptoms,\ngrounding techniques, ways of creating safety \nfor the client,\
      \ proper methods for introducing\nscreening tools, and the protocol to follow\n\
      when a positive screen is obtained. (See Ap­\npendix D for information on specific\
      \ instru­\nments.) Exhibit 1.4-5 is an example of a\nscreening instrument for\
      \ trauma symptoms,\nthe Primary Care PTSD (PC-PTSD) Screen. \nCurrent research\
      \ (Prins et al., 2004) suggests \nthat the optimal cutoff score for the PC-PTSD\
      \ \nis 3. If sensitivity is of greater concern than\nefficiency, a cutoff score\
      \ of 2 is recommended. \nAnother instrument that can screen for trau­\nmatic\
      \ stress symptoms is the four-item self-\nreport SPAN, summarized in Exhibit\
      \ 1.4-6, \nwhich is derived from the 17-item Davidson \nTrauma Scale (DTS).\
      \ SPAN is an acronym for\nthe four items the screening addresses: startle,\n\
      physiological arousal, anger, and numbness. It\nwas developed using a small,\
      \ diverse sample of\nadult patients (N=243; 72 percent women;\n17.4 percent\
      \ African American; average age =\n37 years) participating in several clinical\
      \ stud­\nies, including a family study of rape trauma,\ncombat veterans, and\
      \ Hurricane Andrew sur­\nvivors, among others. \nThe SPAN has a high diagnostic\
      \ accuracy of\n0.80 to 0.88, with sensitivity (percentage of\ntrue positive\
      \ instances) of 0.84 and specificity\n(percentage of true negative instances)\
      \ of 0.91\n(Meltzer-Brody, Churchill, & Davidson, \n1999). SPAN scores correlated\
      \ highly with the\nfull DTS (r = 0.96) and other measures, such\nas the Impact\
      \ of Events Scale (r = 0.85) and\nthe Sheehan Disability Scale (r = 0.87). \n\

      \ of scales with good psychometric \nproperties measure resilience: \n•\nResilience\
      \ Scale (Wagnild & Young, 1993) \n• \nResilience Scale for Adults (Friborg,\
      \ \nHjemdal, Rosenvinge, & Martinussen, 2003) \n• \nConnor Davidson Resilience\
      \ Scale, 25-,10-, \nand 2-Item (Connor & Davidson, 2003; \nCampbell-Sills &\
      \ Stein, 2007; Vaishnavi, \nConnor, & Davidson, 2007, respectively) \n• \nDispositional\
      \ Resilience Scale, 45-,30-, 15­\nitem forms (Bartone, Roland, Picano, \n&Williams,\
      \ 2008) \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nGulf Wars, it\
      \ has since been validated on a\nvariety of noncombat traumas (Keane, Brief,\n\
      Pratt, & Miller, 2007). When using the \nchecklist, identify a specific trauma\
      \ first and\nthen have the client answer questions in rela­\ntion to that one\
      \ specific trauma. \nOther Screening and Resilience \nMeasures \nAlong with\
      \ identifying the presence of\ntrauma-related symptoms that warrant as­\nsessment\
      \ to determine the severity of symp­\ntoms as well as whether or not the individual\
      \ \npossesses subclinical symptoms or has met\ncriteria for a trauma-related\
      \ disorder, clients \nshould receive other screenings for symptoms \nassociated\
      \ with trauma (e.g., depression, sui­\ncidality). It is important that screenings\
      \ ad­\ndress both external and internal resources (e.g.,\nsupport systems, strengths,\
      \ coping styles).\nKnowing the client’s strengths can significant­\nly shape\
      \ the treatment planning process by \nallowing you to use strategies that have\
      \ already\nworked for the client and incorporating strat­\negies to build resilience\
      \ (Exhibit 1.4-8). \nPreliminary research shows improvement of\nindividual resilience\
      \ through treatment inter­\nventions in other populations (Lavretsky,\nSiddarth,\
      \ & Irwin, 2010). \nScreen for suicidality \nAll clients—particularly those\
      \ who have expe­\nrienced trauma—should be screened for sui­\ncidality by asking,\
      \ “In the past, have you ever\nhad suicidal thoughts, had intention to com­\n\
      mit suicide, or made a suicide attempt? Do\nyou have any of those feelings now?\
      \ Have you \nhad any such feelings recently?” Behavioral\nhealth service providers\
      \ should receive training\nto screen for suicide. Additionally, clients with\n\
      substance use disorders and a history of psy­\nchological trauma are at heightened\
      \ risk for\nsuicidal thoughts and behaviors; thus, screen­\ning for suicidality\
      \ is indicated. See TIP 50,\nAddressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in\n\
      Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT, 2009a). For\nadditional descriptions of screening\
      \ processes \nfor suicidality, see TIP 42 (CSAT, 2005c). \nConcluding Note \n\
      Screenings are only beneficial if there are \nfollow-up procedures and resources\
      \ for han­\ndling positive screens, such as the ability to\nreview results with\
      \ and provide feedback to\nthe individual after the screening, sufficient\n\
      resources to complete a thorough assessment\nor to make an appropriate referral\
      \ for an as­\nsessment, treatment planning processes that\ncan easily incorporate\
      \ additional trauma-\ninformed care objectives and goals, and availa­\nbility\
      \ and access to trauma-specific services \nthat match the client’s needs. Screening\
      \ is only \nthe first step! \n110\n\n[Page 133]\nIN THIS CHAPTER \n• Trauma\
      \ -Informed\nPrevention and Treatment \nObjectives  \n• Treatment Issues \n\
      • Making Referrals to \nTrauma -Specific Services\n Clinical Issues Across\n\
      5 Services \nMany clients in behavioral health treatment may have histories\
      \ of\ntrauma, so counselors should be prepared to help them address is­\nsues\
      \ that arise from those histories. This chapter begins with a\nthorough discussion\
      \ of trauma-informed prevention and treatment\nobjectives along with practical\
      \ counselor strategies. Specific treat­\nment issues related to working with\
      \ trauma survivors in a clinical \nsetting are discussed as well, including\
      \ client engagement, pacing\nand timing, traumatic memories, and culturally\
      \ appropriate and\ngender-responsive services. The chapter ends with guidelines\
      \ for \nmaking referrals to trauma-specific services. \nTrauma-Informed Prevention\
      \ and \nTreatment Objectives \nTrauma-informed care (TIC) not only focuses on\
      \ identifying indi­\nviduals who have histories of trauma and traumatic stress\
      \ symp­\ntoms; it also places considerable effort in creating an environment\n\
      that helps them recognize the impact of trauma and determine the \nnext course\
      \ of action in a safe place. For some individuals, psy­\nchoeducation and development\
      \ or reinforcement of coping strate­\ngies will be the most suitable and effective\
      \ strategy, whereas others \nmay request or warrant a referral for more trauma-specific\
      \ inter­\nventions (see Part 1, Chapter 6, of this Treatment Improvement\nProtocol\
      \ [TIP]). Although research is limited in the area of build­\ning resilience\
      \ to prevent exacerbation of trauma symptoms and\ntraumatic stress disorders,\
      \ TIC also focuses on prevention strate­\ngies to avoid retraumatization in\
      \ treatment, to promote resilience, \nand to prevent the development of trauma-related\
      \ disorders. The \nfollowing sections highlight key trauma-informed prevention\
      \ and\ntreatment objectives. \n111"

      \ or being overwhelmed;\nor not having control over sudden disconnec­\ntions\
      \ from others make moment-to-moment \nliving feel unsafe. Clients might express\
      \ feel­\ning unsafe through statements such as, “I can’t \ncontrol my feelings,”\
      \ or, “I just space out and\ndisconnect from the world for no reason,” or,\n\
      “I’m afraid to go to sleep because of the \nnightmares.” The intense feelings\
      \ that accom­\npany trauma can also make clients feel unsafe.\nThey may wake\
      \ up in the morning feeling fine \nbut become immobilized by depression as the\n\
      day progresses. Clients with histories of trau­\nma may experience panicky feelings\
      \ of being \ntrapped or abandoned. An early effort in\ntrauma treatment is thus\
      \ helping the client \nEstablish Safety \nBeyond identifying trauma and trauma-related\
      \ \nsymptoms, the initial objective of TIC is es­\ntablishing safety. Borrowing\
      \ from Herman’s \n(1992) conceptualization of trauma recovery,\nsafety is the\
      \ first goal of treatment. Establish­\ning safety is especially crucial at the\
      \ outset of\ntrauma-informed treatment and often be­\ncomes a recurrent need\
      \ when events or thera­\npeutic changes raise safety issues, such as a\nchange\
      \ in treatment staffing due to vacations. \nIn the context of TIC, safety has\
      \ a variety of\nmeanings. Perhaps most importantly, the cli­\nent has to have\
      \ some degree of safety from \ntrauma symptoms. Recurring intrusive night­\n\
      mares; painful memories that burst forth \n112\n\n[Page 135]\nAdvice to Counselors:\
      \ Strategies To Promote Safety \nStrategy #1: Teach clients how and when to\
      \ use grounding exercises when they feel unsafe or \noverwhelmed. \nStrategy\
      \ #2: Establish some specific routines in individual, group, or family therapy\
      \ (e.g., have an \nopening ritual or routine when starting and ending a group\
      \ session). A structured setting can provide \na sense of safety and familiarity\
      \ for clients with histories of trauma. \nStrategy #3: Facilitate a discussion\
      \ on safe and unsafe behaviors. Have clients identify, on paper, \nbehaviors\
      \ that promote safety and behaviors that feel unsafe for them today.  \nStrategy\
      \ #4: Refer to Seeking Safety: A Treatment Manual for PTSD and Substance Abuse\
      \ (Najavits, \n2002a). This menu-based manual covers an array of treatment topics,\
      \ including the core concept of \nsafety. Each topic consists of several segments,\
      \ including preparing for the session, session format, \nsession content, handouts,\
      \ and guidelines. \nStrategy #5: Encourage the development of a safety plan.\
      \ Depending on the type of trauma, per­\nsonal safety can be an issue; work\
      \ with the client to develop a plan that will help him or her feel in \ncontrol\
      \ and prepared for the unexpected. If the trauma was a natural or human-caused\
      \ disaster, en­\ncourage thinking about how family and friends will respond\
      \ and connect in the event of another cri­\nsis. If sexual abuse or rape was\
      \ the event, encourage thinking about future steps that could help \nmake the\
      \ client safer. There is a delicate balance between preparation and the realization\
      \ that one \ncannot prepare for all possible traumatic events. Nonetheless,\
      \ an action plan can help the client re­\ngain a sense of environmental balance.\
      \ \nPart 1, Chapter 5—Clinical Issues Across Services \ngain more control over\
      \ trauma symptoms (and\nbe able to label them as such) by learning\nmore about\
      \ the client and helping him or her\ndevelop new coping skills to handle symptoms\
      \ \nwhen they arise and stay more grounded when\nflooded with feelings or memories.\
      \ \nA second aspect is safety in the environment. \nTrauma reactions can be\
      \ triggered by sudden\nloud sounds (e.g., television at high volume,\nraised\
      \ voices), tension between people, certain\nsmells, or casual touches that are\
      \ perceived as \ninvasions of physical boundaries. The vulnera­\nbility of exposing\
      \ one’s history in the treat­\nment setting can manifest in the client as \n\
      feeling physically vulnerable and unsafe in the \ntreatment environment. Sudden\
      \ or inade­\nquately explained treatment transitions, such\nas moving from one\
      \ level of treatment to an­\nother or changing counselors, can also evoke \n\
      feelings of danger, abandonment, or instabil­\nity. Early in treatment, trauma\
      \ survivors gen­\nerally value routine and predictability. The \ncounselor should\
      \ recognize these needs and \nrespond appropriately by offering information\n\
      in advance, providing nonshaming responses \nto a client’s reactions to stimuli\
      \ in his or her \nenvironment, and helping the client build a \ndaily structure\
      \ that feels safe. \nA third aspect of safety is preventing a recur­\nrence\
      \ of trauma. People with histories of\ntrauma and substance abuse are more likely\
      \ to\nengage in high-risk behaviors and to experi­\nence subsequent traumas.\
      \ Early treatment\nshould focus on helping clients stop using\nunsafe coping\
      \ mechanisms, such as substance\nabuse, self-harm, and other self-destructive\
      \ \nbehaviors, and replacing them with safe and\nhealthy coping strategies.\
      \ Helping clients \nlearn to protect themselves in reasonable ways \nis a positive\
      \ goal of treatment. \nPrevent Retraumatization \nA key objective in TIC is\
      \ to prevent retrauma­\ntization generated by intervention and treat­\nment\
      \ practices and policies. Unfortunately,\ntreatment settings and clinicians\
      \ can \n113"

      \ Retraumatization \nStrategy #1: Be sensitive to the needs of clients who have\
      \ experienced trauma regarding behaviors \nin the treatment setting that might\
      \ trigger memories of the trauma. \nStrategy #2: Do not ignore clients’ symptoms\
      \ and demands when clients with trauma histories act out \nin response to triggered\
      \ trauma memories; doing so may replicate t he original traumatic experience.\
      \  \nStrategy #3: Be mindful that efforts to control and contain a client’s\
      \ behaviors in treatment can pro­\nduce an abnormal reaction, particularly for\
      \ trauma survivors for whom being trapped was part of the \ntrauma experience.\
      \ \nStrategy #4: Listen for specific triggers that seem to be driving the client’s\
      \ reaction. An important \nstep in recovery is helping the client identify these\
      \ cues and thereby reach a better understanding of \nreactions and behaviors.\
      \ \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nunintentionally create\
      \ retraumatizing experi­\nences (for a review of traumas that can occur\nwhen\
      \ treating serious mental illness, see Frueh\net al., 2005). For instance, compassionate\
      \ in­\nquiry into a client’s history can seem similar to\nthe interest shown\
      \ by a perpetrator many years\nbefore. Direct confrontation by counselors \n\
      about behaviors related to substance abuse can \nbe seen, by someone who has\
      \ been repeatedly \nphysically assaulted, as provocation building\nup to assault.\
      \ Counselor and program efforts \nto help clients constrain destructive behaviors\
      \ \ncan be interpreted as efforts to control and\ndominate the individual. Intrusive\
      \ shaming or\ninsensitive behavior demonstrated by another\nclient in the program\
      \ can threaten a trauma\nsurvivor whose boundaries have been disre­\ngarded\
      \ in the past—thus making the experi­\nence of treatment feel dangerous rather\
      \ than\nsafe. Some staff and agency issues that can\nresult in retraumatization\
      \ include: \n•  Disrespectfully challenging reports of abuse \nor other traumatic\
      \ events. \n•  Discounting a client’s report of a traumatic \nevent. \n•  Using\
      \ isolation. \n•  Using physical restraints. \n•  Allowing the abusive behavior\
      \ of one client\ntoward another to continue without \nintervention. \n•  Labeling\
      \ intense rage and other feelings as \npathological. \n•  Minimizing, discrediting,\
      \ or ignoring client \nresponses. \n•  Disrupting counselor–client relationships\
      \ \nby changing counselors’ schedules and as­\nsignments. \n•  Obtaining urine\
      \ specimens in a nonprivate\nand/or disrespectful manner. \n•  Having clients\
      \ undress in the presence of\nothers. \n•  Being insensitive to a client’s physical\
      \ or \nemotional boundaries. \n•  Inconsistently enforcing rules and allowing\n\
      chaos in the treatment environment. \n•  Applying rigid agency policies or rules\
      \ \nwithout an opportunity for clients to ques­\ntion them. \n•  Accepting agency\
      \ dysfunction, including a\nlack of consistent, competent leadership. \nProvide\
      \ Psychoeducation \nTrauma-informed education informs clients \nabout traumatic\
      \ stress and trauma-related \nsymptoms and disorders as well as the related\
      \ \nconsequences of trauma exposure. It focuses \non giving information to clients\
      \ to help nor­\nmalize presenting symptoms, to highlight po­\ntential short-term\
      \ and long-term \nconsequences of trauma and various paths to\nrecovery, and\
      \ to underscore the message that\nrecovery is possible. Education frequently\

      \ way to prepare clients \n114"

      \ Psychoeducation \nStrategy #1: Remember that this may be the client’s first\
      \ experience with treatment. It’s easy to use \nprogram or clinical jargon when\
      \ you’re around it every day, but most individuals who seek help are \nunfamiliar\
      \ with clinical language, how the program works, and treatment objectives. Psychoeducation\
      \ \nbegins with understanding the client’s expectations and reasons for seeking\
      \ help, followed by edu­\ncating the client and other family members about the\
      \ program. Remember that this is all new for \nthem. \nStrategy #2: After obtaining\
      \ acknowledgment of a trauma history, provide an overview of common \nsymptoms\
      \ and consequences of traumatic stress, regardless of whether the client affirms\
      \ having \ntrauma-related symptoms. It is equally important to educate the client\
      \ on resilience factors associat­\ned with recovery from trauma (Wessely et\
      \ al., 2008). A trauma-informed perspective provides a mes­\nsage that trauma\
      \ reactions are normal responses to an abnormal situation.  \nStrategy #3: Develop\
      \ a resource box that provides an array of printed or multimedia educational\
      \ \nmaterials that address t he program, specific symptoms and tools to combat\
      \ trauma-related symp­\ntoms, treatment options and therapy approaches, advantages\
      \ of peer support, and steps in develop­\ning specific coping strategies. \n\
      Strategy #4: Develop a rotating educational group that matches services and\
      \ client schedules to \ncomplement treatment. Remember that education can play\
      \ a pivotal role in enhancing motivation, in \nnormalizing experiences, and\
      \ in creating a sense of safety as individuals move further into treatment.\
      \ \nFor some survivors, education can be a powerful intervention or prevention\
      \ strategy. \nPart 1, Chapter 5—Clinical Issues Across Services \nfor hearing\
      \ results or to place the screening\nand subsequent assessment findings in proper\n\
      context. Education in and of itself, however,\ndoes not necessarily constitute\
      \ a stand-alone \ntreatment; rather, it can be conceptualized as a\nfirst step\
      \ and/or component of more compre­\nhensive treatment. Nonetheless, education\n\
      may be a prevention and intervention strategy \nfor individuals who have histories\
      \ of trauma \nwithout current consequences or symptoms \nand/or those who have\
      \ reported a resolution\nof past trauma(s). For example, some clients\nmay have\
      \ significantly delayed onset of trau­\nmatic stress symptoms. In this scenario,\
      \ earlier \neducation can enhance recognition of symp­\ntoms and ease the path\
      \ of seeking treatment. \nSome clients do not recognize the link be­\ntween\
      \ their current difficulties and their trau­\nma histories; education can help\
      \ them \nunderstand the possible origin of their diffi­\nculties. Psychoeducation\
      \ presents trauma-\nrelated symptoms that follow a trauma as \nnormal reactions.\
      \ By identifying the source of \nclients’ current difficulties and framing them\
      \ \nas normal thoughts, emotions, and behaviors \nin response to trauma, many\
      \ trauma survivors \nreport a reduction in the intensity of the diffi­\nculties\
      \ or symptoms. Often, a client will ex­\npress relief that his or her reactions\
      \ are\nnormal. You may find the U.S. Department of\nVeterans Affairs (VA) National\
      \ Center on\nPTSD’s educational handouts on traumatic \nstress reactions useful.\
      \ \nPsychoeducation goes beyond the identifica­\ntion of traumatic stress symptoms\
      \ and/or\nlearning about the psychological, cognitive,\nand physical impacts\
      \ of trauma. Numerous \ncurricula are available that use psychoeduca­\ntion\
      \ as a first-line or complementary approach\nto trauma-specific therapies to\
      \ enhance coping\nstrategies in key areas, including safety, emo­\ntional regulation,\
      \ help-seeking, avoidant be­\nhavior, and so forth. An example is S.E.L.F.,\n\

      \ This exchange \ncontributes to people feeling ok about \nbeing vulnerable\
      \ (needing help) as well as \nconfident about what they’re offering. For \n\
      many of us, being the role of ‘getter’ all \nthe time has shaken our confidence,\
      \ \nmaking us feel like we have nothing \nworthwhile to contribute. Peer support\
      \ \nbreaks that all down. It gets complicated \nsomewhat when one of us is paid,\
      \ but \nmodeling this kind of relationship in which \nboth of us learn, offers\
      \ us the real practice \nwe need to feel like a ‘regular’ community \nmember\
      \ as opposed to an ‘integrated \nmental patient’.” \n(Mead, 2008, p.7) \nCase\
      \ Illustration: Linda \nLinda served as an Army nurse in an evacuation hospital\
      \ in Vietnam. She reported her postdeploy­\nment adjustment as difficult and\
      \ isolating but denied any significant symptoms of traumatic stress \nthroughout\
      \ her life. Four years ago, Linda sought treatment for alcohol dependence; during\
      \ the in­\ntake, she recalls denying trauma-related symptoms. “I distinctly\
      \ remember the session,” she re­\ncounts. “The counselor first took my history\
      \ but then gave information on typical symptoms and \nreactions to trauma. I\
      \ thought, ‘Why do I need to hear this? I’ve survived the worst trauma in my\
      \ life.’ \nI didn’t see the value of this information. Then 3 weeks ago, I began\
      \ to have recurrent nightmares, \nthe same graphic type I occasionally had when\
      \ I was in Vietnam. Since then, I’ve been very anxious, \nreliving horrible\
      \ scenes that I’d experienced as a nurse and postponing going to bed in fear\
      \ of having \nthe dreams again. I didn’t understand it. I am 70 years old, and\
      \ the war happened a long time ago. \nThen I began putting it together. Recently,\
      \ the emergency helicopter flight pattern and approach to \nthe area’s hospital\
      \ changed. I began hearing the helicopter periodically in my living room, and\
      \ it re­\nminded me of Vietnam. I knew then that I needed help; I couldn’t stop\
      \ shaking. I felt as if I was losing \ncontrol of my emotions. I remembered\
      \ how the intake counselor took the time to explain common \nsymptoms of trauma.\
      \ That’s why I’m here today.” \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \nareas: creating Safety, regulating Emotions, \naddressing Loss, and redefining\
      \ the Future \n(Bloom, Foderaro, & Ryan, 2006). \nOffer Trauma-Informed Peer\
      \ \nSupport \nLiving with a history of trauma can be isolat­\ning and consuming.\
      \ The experience of trauma\ncan reinforce beliefs about being different,\nalone,\
      \ and marred by the experience. At times,\nbehavioral health treatment for trauma-related\
      \ \neffects can inadvertently reinforce these be­\nliefs. Simply engaging in\
      \ treatment or receiv­\ning specialized services (although warranted)\ncan further\
      \ strengthen clients’ beliefs that \nthere is something wrong with them. Formal­\n\
      ized peer support can enhance the treatment\nexperience. Treatment plus peer\
      \ support can\nbreak the cycle of beliefs that reinforce trau­\nmatic stress\
      \ (e.g., believing that one is perma­\nnently damaged; that nobody could\nunderstand;\
      \ that no one should or could toler­\nate one’s story). Peer support provides\
      \ oppor­\ntunities to form mutual relationships; to learn\nhow one’s history\
      \ shapes perspectives of self,\nothers, and the future; to move beyond trau­\n\

      \ Peer Support \nStrategy #1: Provide education on what peer support is and\
      \ is not. Roles and expectations of peer \nsupport can be confusing, so providing\
      \ clarification in the beginning can be quite useful. It is im­\nportant to\
      \ provide initial education about peer support and the value of using this resource.\
      \ \nStrategy #2: Use an established peer support curriculum to guide the peer\
      \ support process. For ex­\nample, Intentional Peer Support: An Alternative\
      \ Approach (Mead, 2008) is a workbook that highlights \nfour main tasks for\
      \ peer support: building connections, understanding one’s worldview, developing\
      \ \nmutuality, and helping each other move toward set desires and goals. This\
      \ curriculum provides exten­\nsive materials for peer support staff members\
      \ as well as for the individuals seeking peer support. \ninteractive process,\
      \ not as a definitive moment \nwherein someone fixes the “problem.” \nNormalize\
      \ Symptoms  \nSymptoms of trauma can become serious bar­\nriers to recovery\
      \ from substance us\n \ne and men­\ntal disorders, including trauma-related\
      \ ones. \nCounselors should be aware of how trauma \nsymptoms can present and\
      \ how to respond to \nthem when they do appear. A significant step \nin addressing\
      \ symptoms is normalizing them. \nPeople with traumatic stress symptoms need\
      \ \nto know that their symptoms are not unique \nand that their reactions are\
      \ common to their \nexperience(s). Often, normalizing symptoms \ngives considerable\
      \ relief to clients who may \nhave thought that their symptoms signified \n\
      some pervasive, untreatable mental disorder.  \nAdvice to Counselors: Strategies\
      \ To \nNormalize Symptoms \nStrategy #1: Provide psychoeducation on the \ncommon\
      \ symptoms of traumatic stress. \nStrategy #2: Research the client’s most preva­\n\
      lent symptoms specific to trauma, and then \nprovide education to the client.\
      \ For example, \nan individual who was conscious and trapped \nduring or as\
      \ a result of a traumatic event will \nmore likely be hypervigilant about exits,\
      \ plan \nescape routes even in safe environments, and \nhave strong reactions\
      \ to interpersonal and \nenvironmental situations that are perceived as \nhaving\
      \ no options for avoidance or resolution \n(e.g., feeling stuck in a work environment\
      \ \nwhere the boss is emotionally abusive).  \nStrategy #3: First, have the\
      \ client list his or her \nsymptoms. After each symptom, ask the client \nto\
      \ list the negative and positive consequences \nof the symptom. Remember that\
      \ symptoms \nserve a purpose, even if they may not appear \nto work well or\
      \ work as well as they had in the \npast. Focus on how the symptoms have served\
      \ \nthe client in a positive way (see Case Illustra­\ntion: Hector). This exercise\
      \ can be difficult, \nbecause clients as well as counselors often \ndon’t focus\
      \ on the value of symptoms. \nCase Illustration: Hector \nHector was referred\
      \ to a halfway house special­\nizing in co-occurring disorders after inpatient\
      \ \ntreatment for methamphetamine dependence \nand posttraumatic stress disorder\
      \ (PTSD). In \nthe halfway house, he continued to feel over­\nwhelmed with the\
      \ frequency and intensity of \nflashbacks. He often became frustrated, ex­\n\
      pressing anger and a sense of hopelessness, \nfollowed by emotional withdrawal\
      \ from others \nin the house. Normalization strategy #3 was \nintroduced in\
      \ the session. During this exercise, \nhe began to identify many negative aspects\
      \ of \nflashbacks. He felt that he couldn’t control the \noccurrence of flashbacks\
      \ even though he want­\ned to, and he realized that he often felt shame \nafterward.\
      \ In the same exercise, he was also \nurged to identify positive aspects of\
      \ flashbacks. \nAlthough this was difficult, he realized that \nflashbacks were\
      \ clues about content that he \nneeded to address in trauma-specific treat­\n\
      ment. “I realized that a flashback, for me, was a \nbillboard advertising what\
      \ I needed to focus on \nin therapy.” \nPart 1, Chapter 5—Clinical Issues Across\

      \ and Manage Trauma-Related \nTriggers \nStrategy #1: Use the Sorting the Past\
      \ From the Present technique for cognitive realignment \n(Blackburn, 1995) to\
      \ help separate the current situation from the past trauma. Identify one trigger\
      \ at \na time, and then discuss the following questions w\n ith the client:\
      \  \n•\nWhen and where did you begin to notice a reaction? \n• \nHow does this\
      \ situation remind you of your past history or past trauma? \n• \nHow are your\
      \ reactions to the current situation similar to your past reactions to the trauma(s)?\
      \ \n• \nHow was this current situation different from the past trauma? \n• \n\
      How did you react differently to the current situation than to the previous\
      \ trauma? \n• \nHow are you different today (e.g., factors such as age, abilities,\
      \ strength, level of support)?  \n• \nWhat choices can you make that are different\
      \ from the past and that can help you address the \ncurrent situation (trigger)?\
      \ \nAfter reviewing this exercise several times in counseling, put the questions\
      \ on a card for the client to\ncarry and use outside of treatment. Clients with\
      \ substance use disorders can benefit from using the \nsame questions (slightly\
      \ reworded) to address relapse triggers. \n \nStrategy #2: After the individual\
      \ identifies the trigger and draws connections between the trigger \nand past\
      \ trauma, work with him or her to establish responses and coping strategies\
      \ to deal with \ntriggers as they occur. Initially, the planned responses will\
      \ not immediately occur after a trigger, but \nwith practice, the planned responses\
      \ will move closer to the time of the trigger. Some strategies \ninclude an\
      \ acronym that reflects coping strategies (Exhibit 1.5-1), positive self-talk\
      \ generated by \ncognitive–behavioral covert m\n \nodeling exercises (rehearsal\
      \ of coping statements), breathing retrain­\ning, and use of support systems\
      \ (e.g., calling someone). \nStrategy #3: Self-monitoring is any strategy that\
      \ asks a client to observe and record the number of \ntimes something happens,\
      \ to note the intensity of specific experiences, or to describe a specific \n\
      behavioral, emotional, or cognitive phenomenon each time it occurs. For individuals\
      \ with histories of \ntrauma, triggers and flashbacks can be quite frightening,\
      \ intense, and powerful. Even if the client has \nhad just one or two triggers\
      \ or flashbacks, he or she may perceive flashbacks as happening constantly.\
      \ \nOften, it takes time to recover from these experiences. Using self-monitoring\
      \ and asking the client \nto record each time a trigger occurs, along with describing\
      \ the trigger and its intensity level (using a \nscale from 1–10), clients and\
      \ counselors will gain an understanding of the type of triggers present \nand\
      \ the level of distress that each one produces. Moreover, the client may begin\
      \ to see that the \ntriggers don’t actually happen all the time, even though\
      \ they may seem to occur frequently. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health\
      \ Services \nIdentify and Manage Trauma-\nRelated Triggers \nMany clients who\
      \ have traumatic stress are \ncaught off guard with intrusive thoughts, feel­\n\
      ings, sensations, or environmental cues of the \ntrauma. This experience can\
      \ be quite discon­\ncerting, but often, the individual does not\ndraw an immediate\
      \ connection between the \ninternal or external trigger and his or her reac­\n\
      tions. At other times, the trigger is so potent \nthat the individual is unable\
      \ to discern the \npresent trigger from the past trauma and be­\ngins to respond\
      \ as if the trauma is reoccurring. \nKey steps in identifying triggers are to\
      \ reflect\nback on the situation, surroundings, or sensa­\ntions prior to the\
      \ strong reaction. By doing so,\nyou and your client may be able to determine\
      \ \nthe connections among these cues, the past\ntrauma(s), and the client’s\
      \ reaction. Once the \ncue is identified, discuss the ways in which it\nis connected\
      \ to past trauma. For some cues,\nthere will be an obvious and immediate con­\n\
      nection (e.g., having someone say “I love you”\nin a significant relationship\
      \ as an adult and\nconnecting this to an abuser who said the\nsame thing prior\
      \ to a sexual assault). Other \n118"

      Help Clients Draw Connections \nStrategy #1: Writing about trauma can help \n\
      clients gain awareness of their thoughts, feel­\nings, and current experiences\
      \ and can even \nimprove physical health outcomes (Pennebaker, \nKiecolt-Glaser,\
      \ & Glaser, 1988; Smyth, \nHockemeyer, & Tulloch, 2008). Although this \ntool\
      \ may help some people draw connections \nbetween current experiences and past\

      \ up too much intense trauma mate­\nrial (especially among vulnerable trauma\
      \ survi­\nvors with co-occuring substance abuse, \npsychosis, and current domestic\
      \ violence). Jour­\nnal writing is safest when you ask clients to write \nabout\
      \ present-day specific targets, such as log­\nging their use of coping strategies\
      \ or identifying \nstrengths with examples. Writing about trauma \ncan also\
      \ be done via key questions or a work­\nbook that provides questions centered\
      \ upon \ntrauma experiences and recovery.  \nStrategy #2: Encourage clients\
      \ to explore the \nlinks among traumatic experiences and mental \nand substance\

      (SUDS) uses a 0 –10 rating scale, with 0 \nrepresenting content that causes\
      \ no or \nminimal distress and 10 representing \ncontent that is exceptionally\
      \ distressing \nand overwhelming. \n(Wolpe & Abrams, 1991) \nAdvice to Counselors:\
      \ Strategy To  Teach  Balance \nStrategy #1: Teach and use the SUDS in counseling.\
      \ This scale can be useful from the outset as a \nbarometer for the client and\
      \ counselor to measure the level of distress during and outside of sessions.\
      \ \nIt provides a common language for the client and counselor, and it can also\
      \ be used to guide the \nintensity of sessions. SUDS can tangibly show a client’s\
      \ progress in managing experiences. Without a \nscale, it is more difficult\
      \ to grasp that a distressing symptom or circumstance is becoming less and \n\
      less severe without some repeated measure. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral\
      \ Health Services \nabuse should be addressed before attending to\nany co-occurring\
      \ conditions. Others did not\nhave the knowledge and training to evaluate \n\
      trauma issues or were uncomfortable or reluc­\ntant to discuss these sensitive\
      \ issues with cli­\nents (Ouimette & Brown, 2003). Similarly, in\nother behavioral\
      \ health settings, clinicians\nsometimes address trauma-related symptoms\nbut\
      \ do not have experience or training in the \ntreatment of substance abuse.\
      \ \nSo too, people who have histories of trauma\nwill often be unaware of the\
      \ connection be­\ntween the traumas they’ve experienced and\ntheir traumatic\
      \ stress reactions.They may no­\ntice depression, anger, or anxiety, or they\
      \ may\ndescribe themselves as “going crazy” without \nbeing able to pinpoint\
      \ a specific experience that\nproduced the trauma symptoms. Even if clients\n\
      recognize the events that precipitated their\ntrauma symptoms, they may not\
      \ understand \nhow others with similar experiences can have \ndifferent reactions.\
      \ Thus, a treatment goal for \ntrauma survivors is helping them gain aware­\n\
      ness of the connections between their histories \nof trauma and subsequent consequences.\
      \ Seeing\nthe connections can improve clients’ ability to\nwork on recovery\
      \ in an integrated fashion. \nTeach Balance \nYou and your clients need to walk\
      \ a thin line\nwhen addressing trauma. Too much work \nfocused on highly distressing\
      \ content can turn\na desensitization process into a session where­\nby the\
      \ client dissociates, shuts down, or be­\ncomes emotionally overwhelmed. On\
      \ the \nother hand, too little focus by the client or \ncounselor can easily\
      \ reinforce avoidance and\nconfirm the client’s internal belief that it is too\
      \ \ndangerous to deal with the aftermath of the\ntrauma. Several trauma-specific\
      \ theories offer \nguidelines on acceptable levels of distress asso­\nciated\
      \ with the traumatic content that the \ntherapy addresses. For example, some\
      \ tradi­\ntional desensitization processes start at a very \nlow level of subjective\
      \ distress, gradually work­\ning up through a hierarchy of trauma memo­\nries\
      \ and experiences until those experiences \nproduce minimal reactions when paired\
      \ with\nsome coping strategy, such as relaxation train­\ning. Other desensitization\

      pressed and every story told. For some indi­\nviduals, the use of coping skills,\

      \ Resilience \nStrategy #1: Help clients reestablish personal \nand social connections.\
      \ Access community and \ncultural resources; reconnect the person to \nhealing\
      \ resources such as mutual-help groups \nand spiritual supports in the community.\
      \ \nStrategy #2: Encourage t he client to take ac­\ntion. Recovery requires\
      \ activity. Actively taking \ncare of one’s own needs early in treatment can\
      \ \nevolve into assisting others later on, such as by \nvolunteering at a community\
      \ organization or \nhelping military families. \nStrategy #3: Encourage stability\
      \ and predicta­\nbility in the daily routine. Traumatic stress reac­\ntions\
      \ can be debilitating. Keeping a daily \nroutine of sleep, eating, work, errands,\
      \ house­\nhold chores, and hobbies can help the client \nsee that life continues.\
      \ Like exercise, daily liv­\ning skills take time to take hold as the client\
      \ \nlearns to live through symptoms.  \nStrategy #4: Nurture a positive view\
      \ of per­\nsonal, social, and cultural resources. Help cli­\nents recall ways\
      \ in which they successfully \nhandled hardships in the past, such as the loss\
      \ \nof a loved one, a divorce, or a major illness. \nRevisit how those crises\
      \ were addressed. \nStrategy #5: Help clients gain perspective. All \nthings\
      \ pass, even when facing very painful \nevents. Foster a long-term outlook;\
      \ help clients \nconsider stress and suffering in a spiritual \ncontext. \n\
      Strategy #6: Help maintain a hopeful outlook. \nAn optimistic outlook enables\
      \ visions of good \nthings in life and can keep people going even \nin the hardest\
      \ times. There are positive aspects \nto everyone’s life. Taking time to identify\
      \ and \nappreciate these enhances the client’s outlook \nand helps him or her\
      \ persevere. \nStrategy #7: Encourage participation in peer \nsupport, 12-Step,\
      \ and other mutual-help \nprograms. \nSource: American Psychological Association,\

      posed to their traumatic histories without \nsufficient tools, supports, and\
      \ safety to manage \nemotional, behavioral, and physical reactions. \nBuild\
      \ Resilience \nSurvivors are resilient! Often, counselors and\nclients who are\
      \ trauma survivors focus on the \nnegative consequences of trauma while failing\n\
      to recognize the perseverance and attributes \nthat have helped them survive.\
      \ It is natural to\nfocus on what’s not working rather than what\nhas worked.\
      \ To promote growth after trauma\nand establish a strengths-based approach,\
      \ fo­\ncus on building on clients’ resilience. Current \nresilience theories\
      \ claim that building or rein­\nforcing resilience prevents further development\n\
      of trauma-related symptoms and disorders.The\nfollowing Advice to Counselors\
      \ box is adapted\nfrom the American Psychological Association’s \n2003 statement\
      \ on resilience. \nAddress Sleep Disturbances \nSleep disturbances are one of\
      \ the most endur­\ning symptoms of traumatic stress and are a\nparticularly\
      \ common outcome of severe and\nprolonged trauma. Sleep disturbances increase\
      \ \none’s risk of developing traumatic stress; they \nsignificantly alter physical\
      \ and psychological \nprocesses, thus causing problems in daytime \nfunctioning\
      \ (e.g., fatigue, cognitive difficulty,\nexcessive daytime sleepiness). People\
      \ with\nsleep disturbances have worse general health\nand quality of life. The\
      \ cardiovascular and \nimmune systems, among others, may be affect­\ned as well.\
      \ Sleep disturbances can worsen\ntraumatic stress symptoms and interfere with\n\
      healing by impeding the brain’s ability to pro­\ncess and consolidate traumatic\
      \ memories \n(Caldwell & Redeker, 2005). \nSleep disturbances vary among trauma\
      \ survi­\nvors and can include decreased ability to stay\nasleep, frequent awakenings,\
      \ early morning \nunintentional awakening, trouble falling\nasleep, poor quality\
      \ of sleep, and disordered \n121"

      \ 326 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 144]\nAdvice to Counselors: Strategies To Conduct\
      \ a Sleep Intervention \nStrategy #1: Conduct a sleep history assessment focused\
      \ first on the client’s perception of his or her \nsleep patterns. Assess whether\
      \ there is difficulty initiating or staying asleep, a history of frequent or\
      \ \nearly morning awakenings, physically restless sleep, sleepwalking, bedtime\
      \ aversion, and/or disrup­\ntive physical and emotional states upon awakening\
      \ (e.g., confusion, agitation, feeling unrested). Also \ndetermine total sleep\
      \ time, pattern of nightmares, and use of medications, alcohol, and/or caffeine\
      \ \n(see Moul, Hall, Pikonis, & Buysse, 2004, for a review of self-report measures).\
      \  \nStrategy #2: Use a sleep hygiene measure to determine the presence of habits\
      \ that typically inter­\nfere with sleep (e.g., falling asleep while watching\
      \ television). The National Sleep Foundation Web \nsite (http://www.sleepfoundation.org)\
      \ provides simple steps for promoting good sleep hygiene.\nStrategy #3: Provide\
      \ education on sleep hygiene practices. Introduce clients to the idea that practic­\n\
      ing good sleep hygiene is one step toward gaining control over their sleep disturbances.\
      \  \nStrategy #4: Reassess sleep patterns and history during the course of treatment.\
      \ Sleep patterns \noften reflect current client status. For example, clients\
      \ who are struggling are more likely to have \ndisturbed sleep patterns; sleep\
      \ disturbances significantly influence clients’ mental health status. \nStrategy\
      \ #5: Use interventions such as nightmare rehearsals to target recurrent nightmares.\
      \ There \nare numerous examples of imagery-based nightmare rehearsals. Clients\
      \ may be instructed to re­\nhearse repetitively the recurrent nightmare a few\
      \ hours before bedtime. In this instruction, the client \neither rehearses the\
      \ entire nightmare with someone or visualizes the nightmare several times to\
      \ gain \ncontrol over the material and become desensitized to the content. Other\
      \ strategies involve imagin­\ning a change in the outcome of the nightmare (e.g.,\
      \ asking the client to picture getting assistance \nfrom others, even though\
      \ his or her original nightmare reflects dealing with the experience alone).\
      \ \nCase Illustration: Selena \nSelena initially sought treatment for ongoing\
      \ depression (dysthymia). During treatment, she identified \nbeing sexually\
      \ assaulted while attending a party at college. At times, she blames herself\
      \ for the inci­\ndent because she didn’t insist that she and her girlfriends\
      \ stay together during the party and on the \nway back to their dorm afterward.\
      \ Selena reported that she only had two drinks that night: “I could \nnever\
      \ manage more than two drinks before I wanted to just sleep, so I never drank\
      \ much socially.” \nShe was assaulted by someone she barely knew but considered\
      \ a “big brother” in the brother frater­\nnity of her sorority. “I needed a\
      \ ride home. During that ride, it happened,” she said. For years there­\nafter,\
      \ Selena reported mild bouts of depression that began lasting longer and increasing\
      \ in number. \nShe also reported nightmares and chronic difficulty in falling\
      \ asleep. In therapy, she noted avoiding \nher bed until she’s exhausted, saying,\
      \ “I don’t like going to sleep; I know what’s going to happen.” \nShe describes\
      \ fear of sleeping due to nightmares. “It’s become a habit at night. I get very\
      \ involved in \nplaying computer games to lose track of time. I also leave the\
      \ television on through the night be­\ncause then I don’t sleep as soundly and\
      \ have fewer nightmares. But I’m always exhausted.” \nTrauma-Informed Care in\
      \ Behavioral Health Services \nbreathing during sleep (Caldwell & Redeker,\n\
      2005). Most traumatic stress literature focuses \non nightmares, insomnia, and\
      \ frequent awak­\nenings. These disturbances are connected to\ntwo main symptoms\
      \ of traumatic stress: hy­\nperarousal (which causes difficulty in falling\n\
      and remaining asleep) and reexperiencing the \ntrauma (e.g., through recurrent\
      \ nightmares). \nOther sleep disturbances trauma survivors \nreport include\
      \ sleep avoidance or resistance to\nsleep (see Case Illustration: Selena), panic\n\
      awakenings, and restless or unwanted body \nmovements (e.g., hitting your spouse\
      \ uninten­\ntionally in bed while asleep; Habukawa,\nMaeda, & Uchimura, 2010).\

      \ 326 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 145]\nAdvice to Counselors: Strategies To Build\
      \ Trust \nStrategy #1: Clients can benefit from a support or counseling group\
      \ composed of other trauma sur­\nvivors. By comparing themselves with others\
      \ in the group, they can be inspired by those who are \nfurther along in the\
      \ recovery process and helpful to those who are not faring as well as they are.\
      \ \nThese groups also motivate clients to trust others by experiencing acceptance\
      \ and empathy.  \nStrategy #2: Use conflicts that arise in the program as opportunities.\
      \ Successful negotiation of a \nconflict between the client and the counselor\
      \ is a major milestone (van der Kolk, McFarlane, & Van \nder Hart, 1996). Helping\
      \ clients understand that conflicts are healthy and inevitable in relationships\
      \ \n(and that they can be resolved while retaining the dignity and respect of\
      \ all involved) is a key lesson \nfor those whose relationship conflicts have\
      \ been beset by violence, bitterness, and humiliation.  \nStrategy #3: Prepare\
      \ clients for staff changes, vacations, or other separations. Some clients may\
      \ feel \nrejected or abandoned if a counselor goes on vacation or is absent\
      \ due to illness, especially during a \nperiod of vulnerability or intense work.\
      \ A phone call to the client during an unexpected absence can \nreinforce the\
      \ importance of the relationship and the client’s trust. You can use these opportunities\
      \ in \ntreatment to help the client understand that separation is part of relationships;\
      \ work with the client \nto view separation in a new light.  \nStrategy #4:\
      \ Honor the client–counselor relationship, and treat it as significant and mutual.\
      \ You can \nsupport the development of trust by establishing clear boundaries,\
      \ being dependable, working with \nthe client to define explicit treatment goals\
      \ and methods, and demonstrating respect for the client’s \ndifficulty in trusting\
      \ you and the therapeutic setting. \nPart 1, Chapter 5—Clinical Issues Across\
      \ Services \nBuild Trust \nSome traumatic experiences result from trust­\ning\
      \ others (e.g., interpersonal trauma). In oth­\ner cases, trust was violated\
      \ during or after the \ntraumatic experience, as in cases when help\nwas late\
      \ to arrive on the scene of a natural \ndisaster. This lack of trust can leave\
      \ individuals \nalienated, socially isolated, and terrified of\ndeveloping relationships.\
      \ Some feel that the \ntrauma makes them different from others who \nhaven’t\
      \ had similar experiences. Sometimes, a \nclient’s trust issues arise from a\
      \ lack of trust in \nself—for instance, a lack of trust in one’s per­\nceptions,\
      \ judgment, or memories. People who\nhave also experienced severe mental or\
      \ sub­\nstance use disorders may have difficulty trust­\ning others because,\
      \ during the course of their\nillness, they felt alienated or discriminated\n\
      against for behaviors and emotions generated\nby or associated with the disorders.\
      \ \nSome client groups (e.g., gay, lesbian, and bi­\nsexual clients; people\
      \ from diverse cultures;\nthose with serious mental illness) evidence \nsignificant\
      \ mistrust because their trust has\nbeen repeatedly violated in the past. Traumatic\n\
      experiences then compound this mistrust.\nMistrust can come from various sources,\
      \ is \nusually unstated, and, if left unaddressed, can\nimpede treatment. For\
      \ example, some clients \nleave treatment early or do not engage in po­\ntentially\
      \ beneficial treatments. Others avoid\nissues of trust and commitment by leaving\n\
      treatment when those issues begin to arise. \nEstablishing a safe, trusting\
      \ relationship is \nparamount to healing—yet this takes time in\nthe counseling\
      \ process. Counselors and other\nbehavioral health professionals need to be\
      \ \nconsistent throughout the course of treatment;\nthis includes maintaining\
      \ consistency in the\nparameters set for availability, attendance, and\nlevel\
      \ of empathy. Trust is built on behavior\nshown inside and outside of treatment;\
      \ you \nshould immediately address any behavior that\nmay even slightly injure\
      \ the relationship (e.g.,\nbeing 5 minutes late for an appointment, not\nresponding\
      \ to a phone message in a timely \nmanner, being distracted in a session). \n\

      \ nervous-looking woman, is brought by her parents to a community mental \n\
      health clinic near their home in rural Indiana. During the intake process, the\
      \ counselor learns that \nAbby is an Army Reservist who returned from 12 months\
      \ of combat duty 3 years ago. The war expe­\nrience changed her in many ways.\
      \ Her deployment pulled her away from veterinary school as well as \nthe strong\
      \ emotional support of family, friends, and fellow classmates. She got along\
      \ with her unit in \nIraq and had no disciplinary problems. While there, she\
      \ served as a truck driver in the Sunni Triangle. \nHer convoy was attacked\
      \ often by small arms fire and was once struck by an improvised explosive \n\
      device. Although Abby sustained only minor injuries, two of her close friends\
      \ were killed. With each \nsuccessive convoy, her level of fear and foreboding\
      \ grew, but she continued performing as a driver.  \nSince returning to the\
      \ United States, she has mostly stayed at home and has not returned to school,\
      \ \nalthough she i s helping out o\n n the farm with various chores. Abby has\
      \ isolated herself from both \nfamily members and lifelong friends, saying she\
      \ doesn’t think others can understand what she went \nthrough and that she prefers\
      \ being alone. She reports to her parents and the counselor that she is \nvaguely\
      \ afraid to be in cars and feels most comfortable in her room or working alone,\
      \ doing routine \ntasks, at home. Abby also says that she now understands how\
      \ fragile life can be. \nShe has admitted to her parents that she drinks alcohol\
      \ on a regular basis, something she did not do \nbefore her deployment, and\
      \ that on occasion, she has experienced blackouts. Abby feels she needs \na\
      \ drink before talking with strangers or joining in groups of friends or family.\
      \ She confided to her \nfather that she isolates herself so that she can drink\
      \ without having to explain her drinking to others.  \nThe counselor recognizes\
      \ Abby’s general sense of lacking internal control and feeling powerless \n\
      over what will happen to her in the future. He adopts a motivational interviewing\
      \ style to establish \nrapport and a working alliance with Abby. During sessions,\
      \ the counselor asks Abby to elaborate on \nher strengths; he reinforces strengths\
      \ that involve taking action in life, positive self-statements, and \ncomments\
      \ that deal with future plans. He also introduces Abby to an Iraq War veteran\
      \ who came \nhome quite discouraged about putting his life together but has\
      \ done well getting reintegrated. The \ncounselor urges Abby go to the local\
      \ VA center so that she can meet and bond with other recently \nreturned veterans.\
      \ He also encourages Abby to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, emphasiz­\n\
      ing that she won’t be pressured to talk or interact with others more than she\
      \ chooses to.  \nThe counselor continues to see Abby every week and begins using\
      \ cognitive–behavioral techniques \nto help her examine some of her irrational\
      \ fears about not being able to direct her life. He asks Abby \nto keep a daily\
      \ diary of activities related to achieving her goals of getting back to school\
      \ and \nreestablishing a social network. In each session, Abby reviews her progress\
      \ using the diary as a \nmemory aid, and the counselor reinforces these positive\
      \ efforts. After 4 months of treatment, Abby \nreenrolls in college and is feeling\
      \ optimistic about her ability to achieve her career plans. \nTrauma-Informed\
      \ Care in Behavioral Health Services \nSupport Empowerment \nStrong feelings\
      \ of powerlessness can arise in\ntrauma survivors seeking to regain some con­\n\
      trol of their lives. Whether a person has sur­\nvived a single trauma or chronic\
      \ trauma, the \nsurvivor can feel crushed by the weight of\npowerlessness. Mental\
      \ illness and substance \nabuse, too, can be disempowering; clients may \nfeel\
      \ that they’ve lost control over their daily \nlives, over a behavior such as\
      \ drug use, or over \npowerful emotions such as fear, sadness, or\nanger. Empowerment\
      \ means helping clients \nfeel greater power and control over their lives,\n\
      as long as such control is within safe and\nhealthy bounds. A key facet of empowerment\n\
      is to help clients build on their strengths. Em­\npowerment is more than helping\
      \ clients dis­\ncover what they “should” do; it is also helping\nthem take the\
      \ steps they feel ready to take. \n124"

      \ to assume an active role in how the delivery of treatment services \noccurs.\
      \ An essential avenue is regularly scheduled and structured client feedback\
      \ on program and \nclinical services (e.g., feedback surveys). Some of the most\
      \ effective initiatives to reinforce client em­\npowerment are the development\
      \ of peer support services and the involvement of former clients in \nparts\
      \ of the organizational structure, such as the advisory board or other board\
      \ roles.  \nStrategy #4: Establish a sense of self-efficacy in clients; their\
      \ belief in their own ability to carry out a \nspecific task successfully—is\
      \ key. You can help clients come to believe in the possibility of change \n\
      and in the hope of alternative approaches to achieving change. Supporting clients\
      \ in accepting in­\ncreasing responsibility for choosing and carrying out personal\
      \ change can facilitate their return to \nempowerment (Miller & Rollnick, 2002).\
      \ \nAdvice to Counselors: Strategies To \nAcknowledge and Address Grief \nStrategy\
      \ #1: Help the client grieve by being \npresent, by normalizing the grief, and\
      \ by as­\nsessing social supports and resources.  \nStrategy #2: When the client\
      \ begins to discuss \nor express grief, focus on having him or her \nvoice the\
      \ losses he or she experienced due to \ntrauma. Remember to clarify that losses\
      \ include \ninternal experiences, not just physical losses. \nStrategy #3: For\
      \ a client who has difficulty \nconnecting feelings to experiences, assign a\
      \ \nfeelings journal in which he or she can log and \nname each feeling he or\
      \ she experiences, rate \nthe feeling’s intensity numerically, and describe\
      \ \nthe situation during which the feeling occurred. \nThe client may choose\
      \ to share the journal in \nan individual or group session.  \nStrategy #4:\
      \ Note that some clients benefit \nfrom developing a ritual or ceremony to honor\
      \ \ntheir losses, whereas others prefer offering \ntime or resources to an association\
      \ that repre­\nsents the loss. \nPart 1, Chapter 5—Clinical Issues Across Services\
      \ \nAcknowledge Grief and \nBereavement \nThe experience of loss is common after\
      \ trau­\nmas, whether the loss is psychological (e.g., no\nlonger feeling safe)\
      \ or physical (e.g., death of a\nloved one, destruction of community, physical\
      \ \nimpairment). Loss can cause public displays of\ngrief, but it is more often\
      \ a private experience.\nGrieving processes can be emotionally over­\nwhelming\
      \ and can lead to increased substance \nuse and other impulsive behaviors as\
      \ a way to\nmanage grief and other feelings associated\nwith the loss. Even\
      \ for people who experi­\nenced trauma years prior to treatment, grief is \n\
      still a common psychological issue. Delayed or\nabsent reactions of acute grief\
      \ can cause ex­\nhaustion, lack of strength, gastrointestinal \nsymptoms, and\
      \ avoidance of emotions. \nRisk factors of chronic bereavement (grief\nlasting\
      \ more than 6 months) can include:\n•  Perceived lack of social support. \n\
      •  Concurrent crises or stressors (including\nreactivation of PTSD symptoms).\
      \ \n•  High levels of ambivalence about the loss. \n•  An extremely dependent\
      \ relationship prior\nto the loss. \n125"

      the intake process or treatment, stop exploring \nthe material that triggered\

      \ to self-soothe.  \nStrategy #2: Seek consultation from supervi­\nsors and/or\
      \ colleagues (e.g., to explore wheth­\ner a new case conceptualization is needed\
      \ at \nthis point). \nStrategy #3: Refer the client for a further as­\nsessment\
      \ to determine whether a referral is \nnecessary for trauma-specific therapy\
      \ or a \nhigher level of care, or use of multiple levels of \ncare (e.g., intensive\
      \ outpatient care, partial \nhospitalization, residential treatment). \nStrategy\
      \ #4: Focus on coping skills and en­\ncourage participation in a peer support\
      \ \nprogram. \nStrategy #5: When a client becomes agitated \nand distressed,\
      \ carefully explore with the client \nwhat is causing this state. When such\
      \ feelings \narise because of current threats in the client’s \nlife or environment,\
      \ it is dangerous to halt or \nsoothe away responses that act as warning \n\
      signals (Pope & Brown, 1996). When a client is \nin a situation involving domestic\
      \ violence, lives \nin a dangerous neighborhood, or has run out of \nmoney for\
      \ food, he or she requires direct and \nconcrete assistance rather than simple\
      \ emo­\ntional support. \nSource: Briere & Scott, 2006b. \nManaging Destabilization\
      \ \nWhen a client becomes destabilized during a \nsession, you can respond in\
      \ the following man­\nner: “Let’s slow down and focus on helping you \nbe and\
      \ feel safe. What can we do to allow you \nto take care of yourself at this\
      \ moment? Then, \nwhen you feel ready, we can decide what to \nfocus on next.”\
      \ \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nMonitor and Facilitate\
      \ Stability \nStability refers to an ongoing psychological \nand physical state\
      \ whereby one is not over­\nwhelmed by disruptive internal or external \nstimuli\
      \ (Briere & Scott, 2006b). It’s common \nfor individuals to have an increase\
      \ in symp­\ntoms, distress, or impairment when dealing\nwith the impact of their\
      \ trauma or talking\nabout specific aspects of their trauma. There is \na thin\
      \ line that the client and counselor need \nto negotiate and then walk when\
      \ addressing \ntrauma. Too much work focused on highly \ndistressing content\
      \ can turn a desensitization\nprocess into a session that causes the client\
      \ to\ndissociate, shut down, or become emotionally \noverwhelmed. On the other\
      \ hand, too little \nfocus by the client or counselor can easily rein­\nforce\
      \ avoidance and confirm the client’s inter­\nnal belief that it is too dangerous\
      \ to deal with\nthe aftermath of the trauma. \nClients should have some psychological\
      \ stabil­\nity to engage in trauma-related work. An im­\nportant distinction\
      \ can be made between a \nnormative increase in symptoms (e.g., the typ­\nical\
      \ up-and-down course of traumatic stress \nreactions or substance abuse) and\
      \ destabiliza­\ntion (dangerous, significant decrease in func­\ntioning). Signs\
      \ of destabilization include\n(Green Cross Academy of Traumatology,\n2007; Najavits,\
      \ 2002b): \n•  Increased substance use or other unsafe \nbehavior (e.g., self-harm).\
      \ \n•  Increased psychiatric symptoms (e.g., de­\npression, agitation, anxiety,\
      \ withdrawal, \nanger). \n•  Increased symptoms of trauma (e.g., severe\ndissociation).\
      \ \n•  Helplessness or hopelessness expressed\nverbally or behaviorally. \n\
      •  Difficulty following through on commit­\nments (e.g., commitment to attend\
      \ treat­\nment sessions). \n•  Isolation. \n•  Notable decline in daily activities\
      \ (e.g.,\nself-care, hygiene, care of children or pets,\ngoing to work). \n\

      \ Engagement \nStrategy #1: According to Mahalik (2001), the \nstandard method\
      \ of handling clients’ lack of \nengagement is exploring it with them, clari­\n\
      fying the situation through discussion with \nthem, reinterpreting (e.g., from\
      \ “can’t” to \n“won’t” to “willing”), and working through the \nsituation toward\
      \ progress.  \nStrategy #2: To improve engagement into \ntreatment, try motivational\
      \ interviewing and \nenhancement techniques. For additional in­\nformation on\
      \ such techniques, see TIP 35, En­\nhancing Motivation for Change in Substance\
      \ \nAbuse Treatment (Center for Substance Abuse \nTreatment [CSAT], 1999b).\
      \  \nPart 1, Chapter 5—Clinical Issues Across Services \nTreatment Issues \n\
      The treatment environment itself can signifi­\ncantly affect how clients experience\
      \ traumatic\nstress and how the client responds to treat­\nment. Some specific\
      \ issues related to working\nwith trauma survivors in a clinical setting are\n\
      discussed in the following sections. \nClient Engagement \nA lack of engagement\
      \ in treatment is the cli­\nent’s inability to make progress toward treat­\n\
      ment goals, deal with important topics in\ntreatment, or complete treatment.\
      \ Clients who\nhave histories of trauma will express ambiva­\nlence about treatment\
      \ similarly to others, ex­\ncept that clients who have traumatic stress can\n\
      feel more “stuck” and perceive themselves as \nhaving fewer options. In addition,\
      \ clients may\nbe avoiding engagement in treatment because \nit is one step\
      \ closer to addressing their trauma.\nYou should attend to the client’s motivation\
      \ to \nchange, implement strategies that address am­\nbivalence toward treatment,\
      \ and use approach­\nes that help clients overcome avoidant\nbehavior. \nPacing\
      \ and Timing \nAlthough your training or role as a counselor\nmay prohibit you\
      \ from providing trauma-\nspecific services, you must still be prepared for\n\
      the fact that clients are not as focused on \nwhen or where it is most appropriate\
      \ to ad­\ndress trauma—they want relief, and most lay \nand professional people\
      \ have been taught that\nthe only path to recovery is disclosure. Some \nclients\
      \ are reluctant to talk about anything\nassociated with their histories of trauma.\
      \ Oth­\ner clients immediately want to delve into the \nmemories of their trauma\
      \ without developing\na safe environment. The need to gain any relief\nfor the\
      \ traumatic stress pushes some individu­\nals to disclose too quickly, without\
      \ having the\nnecessary support and coping skills to manage \nthe intensity\
      \ of their memories. Clients who\nenter treatment and immediately disclose past\n\
      trauma often don’t return because the initial \nencounter was so intense or\
      \ because they ex­\nperienced considerable emotional distress for\nseveral days\
      \ afterward and/or in anticipation\nof the next session. \nProper pacing of\
      \ sessions, disclosure, and in­\ntensity is paramount. Clients who immediate­\n\
      ly disclose without proper safety nets are \nactually retraumatizing themselves\
      \ by reliving\nthe experience without adequate support—\noften placing themselves\
      \ in the same circum­\nstances that occurred during the actual trau­\nmas they\
      \ experienced. Although you should\nnot adamantly direct clients not to talk\
      \ about \nwhat happened, it is important to discuss with \nthe clients, even\
      \ if you have to interrupt them\nempathically and respectfully, the potential\n\
      consequences of disclosing too soon and too \nfast. Ask whether they have done\
      \ this before,\nand then inquire about the outcome. Rein­\nforce with clients\
      \ that trauma heals when \nthere are support, trust, and skills in place to\n\
      manage the memories of the traumatic experi­\nences. Ideally, disclosure begins\
      \ after these \nelements are secured, but realistically, it is a \n127"

      \ \nas to when and how much should be ad­\ndressed in any given session. Remember\
      \ not to \ninadvertently give a message that it is too dan­\ngerous to talk\
      \ about trauma; instead, reinforce \nthe importance of addressing trauma without\
      \ \nfurther retraumatization. \nAdvice to Counselors: Strategies To Establish\
      \ Appropriate Pacing and Timing \nStrategy #1: Frequently discuss and request\
      \ feedback from clients about pacing and timing. Moving \ntoo quickly into discussion\
      \ of the trauma can increase the risk of dissociation, overactivation of \n\
      memories, and feeling overwhelmed. \nStrategy #2: Use the SUDS as a barometer\
      \ of intensity to determine the level of work. \nStrategy #3: Slowly increase\
      \ the speed of interventions and continually adjust the intensity of inter­\n\
      ventions; move in and out of very intense work, or use strategies that decrease\
      \ the intensity when \nnecessary. One approach that typically decreases the\
      \ intensity of traumatic memories is to ask the \nindividual to imagine that\
      \ he or she is seeing the scene through a window or on a television screen.\
      \ \nThis helps decrease intensity and the risk of dissociation. It provides\
      \ an opportunity for the client to \nview the trauma from a different perspective\
      \ and a strategy to use outside of treatment to shift f rom \nreliving the trauma\
      \ to observing it from a neutral position.  \nStrategy #4: Monitor clients to\
      \ ensure that treatment does not overwhelm their internal capacities, \nretraumatize\
      \ them, or result in excessive avoidance; make sure therapy occurs in the “therapeutic\
      \ \nwindow” (Briere & Scott, 2006b).  \nStrategy #5: Be alert to signs that\
      \ discussions of trauma, including screening, assessment, and in­\ntake processes,\
      \ are going too fast. Mild to moderate signs are:  \n•\nMissing counseling appointments\
      \ after discussions of important material. \n• \nPeriods of silence. \n• \n\
      Dissociation. \n• \nMisunderstanding what are usually understandable concepts.\
      \ \n• \nRedirecting the focus of the discussion when certain issues arise. \n\
      Strategy #6: Observe the client’s emotional state. Slow down; seek consultation\
      \ if the client exhibits: \n•\nPersistent resistance to addressing trauma symptoms.\
      \ \n• \nRepetitive flashbacks. \n• \nIncrease in dissociation.  \n• \nRegression.\
      \ \n• \nDifficulty in daily functioning (e.g., trouble maintaining everyday\
      \ self-care tasks). \n• \nSubstance use relapses. \n• \nSelf-harm or suicidal\
      \ thoughts/behaviors (e.g., talking about suicide). \nStrategy #7: Use caution\
      \ and avoid (Briere, 1996b, p. 115):  \n•\nEncouraging clients to describe traumatic\
      \ material in detail before they can deal with the conse­\nquences of disclosure.\
      \ \n• \nUsing overly stressful interventions (e.g., intensive role-plays, group\
      \ confrontation, guided \nimagery). \n• \nConfrontations or interpretations\
      \ that are too challenging given the client’s current functioning. \n• \nDemanding\

      \ to remember are: \n•\nSome people are not able to completely \nremember past\

      \ moments. \n• \nIn addition to exploring the memories \nthemselves, it can\
      \ be beneficial to explore \nhow a memory of an event helps the client \nunderstand\
      \ his or her feeling, thinking, and \nbehaving in the present. \n• \nPersistently\
      \ trying to recall all the details of \na traumatic event can impair focus on\
      \ the \npresent. \nPart 1, Chapter 5—Clinical Issues Across Services \nmental\
      \ disorders all influence length of treat­\nment. External factors, such as\
      \ transportation\nand childcare, caps on insurance coverage, and\nlimitations\
      \ in professional resources, can also\naffect length of treatment. In general,\
      \ longer\ntreatment experiences should be expected for \nclients who have histories\
      \ of multiple or early \ntraumas, meet diagnostic criteria for multiple\nAxis\
      \ I or Axis II diagnoses, and/or require \nintensive case management. Most of\
      \ the em­\npirically studied and/or manual-based models \ndescribed in the next\
      \ chapter are short-term \nmodels (e.g., lasting several months); however,\n\
      ongoing care is indicated for clients with more \ncomplex co-occurring trauma\
      \ disorders. \nTraumatic Memories \nOne of the most controversial issues in\
      \ the \ntrauma field is the phenomenon of “recovered\nmemories” or “traumatic\
      \ amnesia” (Brewin,\n2007). Practitioners working with traumatized\nindividuals\
      \ are particularly concerned about\nthe possibility of new memories of the trau­\n\
      matic event emerging during the course of\ntherapy and the possibility of these\
      \ memories \nbeing induced by the clinician. Scientific re­\nviews indicate\
      \ that people can experience am­\nnesia and delayed recall for some memories\
      \ of a\nwide variety of traumas, including military \ncombat and prisoner of\
      \ war experiences, natural \ndisasters and accidents, childhood sexual abuse,\n\
      and political torture (Bowman & Mertz, 1996;\nBrewin, 2007; Karon & Widener,\
      \ 1997;\nMcNally, 2005). In some cases, the survivor\nwill not remember some\
      \ of what happened,\nand the counselor may need to help the client\nface the\
      \ prospect of never knowing all there is \nto know about the past and accept\
      \ moving on\nwith what is known. \nLegal Issues \nLegal issues can emerge during\
      \ treatment. A\nclient, for instance, could seek to prosecute a\nperpetrator\
      \ of trauma (e.g., for domestic vio-\nlence) or to sue for damages sustained\
      \ in an \naccident or natural disaster. The counselor’s \nrole is not to provide\
      \ legal advice, but rather,\nto offer support during the process and, if\nneeded,\
      \ refer the client to appropriate legal\nhelp (see Advice to Counselors box\
      \ on p. 131). \nA legal matter can dominate the treatment\natmosphere for its\
      \ duration. Some clients have \ndifficulty making progress in treatment until\
      \ \nmost or all legal matters are resolved and no\nlonger act as ongoing stressors.\
      \ \nForgiveness \nClients may have all sorts of reactions to what \nhas happened\
      \ to them. They may feel grateful \nfor the help they received, joy at having\
      \ sur­\nvived, and dedication to their recovery. At the\nother extreme, they\
      \ may have fantasies of re­\nvenge, a loss of belief that the world is a good\
      \ \nplace, and feelings of rage at what has hap­\npened. They may hold a wide\
      \ variety of beliefs \nassociated with these feelings. \nOne issue that comes\
      \ up frequently among\ncounselors is whether to encourage clients to\nforgive.\
      \ The issue of forgiveness is a very deli­\ncate one. It is key to allow survivors\
      \ their feel­\nings, even if they conflict with the counselor’s \nown responses.\
      \ Some may choose to forgive \nthe perpetrator, whereas others may remain\n\
      angry or seek justice through the courts and\nother legal means. Early in recovery\

      \ Traumatic Memories \nStrategy #1: Most people who were sexually abused as\
      \ children remember all or part of what hap­\npened to them, although they do\
      \ not necessarily fully understand or disclose it. Do not assume that \nthe\
      \ role of the clinician is to investigate, corroborate, or substantiate allegations\
      \ or memories of \nabuse (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000b).  \n\
      Strategy #2: Be aware that forgotten memories of childhood abuse can be remembered\
      \ years later. \nClinicians should maintain an empathic, nonjudgmental, neutral\
      \ stance toward reported memories of \nsexual abuse or other trauma. Avoid prejudging\
      \ the cause of the client’s difficulties or the veracity of \nthe client’s reports.\
      \ A counselor’s prior belief that physical or sexual abuse, or other factors,\
      \ are or \nare not the cause of the client’s problems can interfere with appropriate\
      \ assessment and treatment \n(APA, 2000b).  \nStrategy #3: Focus on assisting\
      \ clients in coming to their own conclusions about t he accuracy of \ntheir\
      \ memories or in adapting to uncertainty regarding what actually occurred. The\
      \ therapeutic goal \nis to help clients understand the impact of the memories\
      \ or abuse experiences on their lives and to \nreduce their detrimental consequences\
      \ in the present and future (APA, 2000b). \nStrategy #4: Some clients have concerns\
      \ about whether or not a certain traumatic event did or did \nnot happen. In\
      \ such circumstances, educate clients about traumatic memories, including the\
      \ fact that \nmemories aren’t always exact representations of past events; subsequent\
      \ events and emotions can \nhave the effect of altering the original memory.\
      \ Inform clients that it is not always possible to deter­\nmine whether an event\
      \ occurred but that treatment can still be effective in alleviating distress.\
      \ \nStrategy #5: There is evidence that suggestibility can be enhanced and pseudomemories\
      \ can devel­\nop in some individuals when hypnosis is used as a memory enhancement\
      \ or retrieval strategy. Hyp­\nnosis and guided imagery techniques can enhance\
      \ relaxation and teach self-soothing strategies with \nsome clients; however,\
      \ use of these techniques is not recommended in the active exploration of \n\
      memories of abuse (Academy of Traumatology, 2007). \nStrategy #6: When clients\
      \ are highly distressed by intrusive flashbacks of delayed memories, help \n\
      them move through the distress. Teach coping strategies and techniques on how\
      \ to tolerate strong \naffect and distress (e.g., mindfulness practices). \n\
      Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \ntrauma, it is best to direct\
      \ clients toward fo­\ncusing on stabilization and a return to normal\nfunctioning;\
      \ suggest that, if possible, they de­\nlay major decisions about forgiveness\
      \ until \nthey have a clearer mind for making decisions\n(Herman, 1997). Even\
      \ in later stages of recov­\nery, it’s not essential for the client to forgive\
      \ in\norder to recover. Forgiveness is a personal \nchoice independent of recovery.\
      \ Respect cli­\nents’ personal beliefs and meanings; don’t push \nclients to\
      \ forgive or impose your own beliefs \nabout forgiveness onto clients. \nIn\
      \ the long-term healing process, typically \nmonths or years after the trauma(s),\
      \ for­\ngiveness may become part of the discussion for \nsome people and some\
      \ communities. For ex­\nample, in South Africa, years after the bitter\nand\
      \ bloody apartheid conflicts, a Truth and\nReconciliation Commission was established\
      \ by \nthe Government. Public hearings created dia­\nlog and aired what had\
      \ been experienced as a\nmeans, ultimately, to promote forgiveness and\ncommunity\
      \ healing. By addressing very diffi­\ncult topics in public, all could potentially\
      \ \nbenefit from the discourse. Similarly, a paren­\ntal survivor of the Oklahoma\
      \ City bombing\nwas, at first, bitter about his daughter’s early,\nunfair, and\
      \ untimely death. Today, he gives \ntalks around the world about the abolition\
      \ of \nthe death penalty. He sat with convicted \n130"

      \ Legal Proceedings \nStrategy #1: If you’re aware of legal proceedings, you\
      \ can play a key role in helping your client pre­\npare emotionally for their\
      \ impact, such as what it might be like to describe the trauma to a judge or\
      \ \njury, or how to cope with seeing the perpetrator in court. When helping\
      \ a client prepare, however, \nbe careful not to provide legal advice.  \nStrategy\
      \ #2: Help clients separate a successful legal outcome from a successful treatment\
      \ outcome. \nIf clients connect these two outcomes, difficulties can arise.\
      \ For example, a client may discontinue \ntreatment after his or her assailant\
      \ is sentenced to serve prison time, believing that the symptoms \nwill abate\
      \ without intervention.  \nStrategy #3: If clients express interest in initiating\
      \ a civil or criminal suit, encourage them to consider \nthe ways in which they\
      \ are and are not prepared for this, including their own mental states, capacity\
      \ \nfor resilience, and inevitable loss of confidentiality (Pope & Brown, 1996).\
      \ Inform clients coping with \nlegal issues that involvement in the legal process\
      \ can be retraumatizing.  \nStrategy #4: Emphasize, for trauma survivors who\
      \ are involved in legal proceedings against an as­\nsailant, that “not guilty”\
      \ is a legal finding—it is based on the degree of available evidence and is\
      \ not \na claim that certain events in question did not occur. They should also\
      \ receive, from an attorney or \nother qualified individual, information on:\
      \  \n•\nThe nature of the legal process as it pertains to the clients’ specific\
      \ cases. \n• \nThe estimated duration and cost of legal services, if applicable.\
      \ \n• \nWhat to expect during police investigations. \n• \nCourt procedures.\
      \ \n• \nFull information on all possible outcomes. \n• \nWhat to expect during\
      \ cross-examination. \nStrategy #5: Counselors can be called on to assist with\
      \ a legal case involving trauma. The court may \nrequire you to provide treatment\
      \ records, to write a letter summarizing your client’s progress, or to \ntestify\
      \ at a trial. Always seek supervisory and legal advice in such situations and\
      \ discuss with the cli­\nent the possible repercussions that this might have\
      \ for the therapeutic relationship. As a general \nrule, it is best practice\
      \ to avoid dual roles or relationships.  \nPart 1, Chapter 5—Clinical Issues\
      \ Across Services \nbomber Timothy McVeigh’s father while the \nman’s son was\
      \ executed in Indiana at a Federal \nprison several years after the bombing.\
      \ For this \nman, forgiveness and acceptance helped him \nattain personal peace.\
      \ Other trauma survivors \nmay choose never to forgive what happened,\nand this,\
      \ too, is a legitimate response. \nCulturally and Gender Responsive \nServices\
      \ \nCulture is the lens through which reality is \ninterpreted. Without an understanding\
      \ of cul­\nture, it is difficult to gauge how individuals\norganize, interpret,\
      \ and resolve their traumas.\nThe challenge is to define how culture affects\
      \ \nindividuals who have been traumatized. \nIncreased knowledge of PTSD (Wilson\
      \ &\nTang, 2007), mental illness, and substance use \ndisorders and recovery\
      \ (Westermeyer, 2004)\nrequires behavioral health practitioners to con­\nsider\
      \ the complicated interactions between\nculture, personality, mental illness,\
      \ and sub­\nstance abuse in adapting treatment protocols.\nThis section offers\
      \ some general guidelines for\nworking with members of cultures other than \n\
      one’s own. Treatment for traumatic stress,\nmental illness, substance use disorders,\
      \ and co-\noccurring trauma-related symptoms is more \neffective if it is culturally\
      \ responsive. \n131"

      \ includes a counselor’s \nknowledge of: \n•\nWhether the client is a survivor\
      \ of cultural \ntrauma (e.g., genocide, war, government \noppression, torture,\
      \ terrorism). \n• \nHow to use cultural brokers (i.e., authorities \nwithin\
      \ the culture who can help interpret \ncultural patterns and serve as liaisons\
      \ to \nthose outside the culture). \n• \nHow trauma is viewed by an individual’s\
      \ \nsociocultural support network. \n• \nHow to differentiate PTSD, trauma-related\
      \ \nsymptoms, and other mental disorders in \nthe culture. \nFor more specific\
      \ information on cultural com­\npetence in trauma therapy, see Brown (2008).\
      \ \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nThe U.S. Department\
      \ of Health and Human\nServices (2003) has defined the term “cultural\ncompetence”\
      \ as follows: \nCultural competence is a set of values, behav­\niors, attitudes,\
      \ and practices within a system, \norganization, program, or among individuals\
      \ \nthat enables people to work effectively across \ncultures. It refers to\
      \ the ability to honor and \nrespect the beliefs, language, interpersonal \n\
      styles, and behaviors of individuals and fami­\nlies receiving s ervices, as\
      \ well as staff who are \nproviding such services. Cultural competence \nis\
      \ a dynamic, ongoing, developmental process \nthat requires a long-term commitment\
      \ and is \nachieved over time (p. 12).  \nCultural competence is a process that\
      \ begins \nwith an awareness of one’s own culture and \nbeliefs and includes\
      \ an understanding of how \nthose beliefs affect one’s attitudes toward peo­\n\
      ple of other cultures. It is rooted in respect,\nvalidation, and openness toward\
      \ someone \nwhose social and cultural background is differ­\nent from one’s\
      \ own. For a thorough review of \ncultural competence, see the planned TIP,\
      \ Im­\nproving Cultural Competence (Substance Abuse \nand Mental Health Services\
      \ Administration \n[SAMHSA], planned c). \nIn some cultures, an individual’s\
      \ needs take \nprecedence over group needs (Hui & Triandis,\n1986), and problems\
      \ are seen as deriving from \nthe self. In other cultures, however, complex\n\
      family, kin, and community systems take prec­\nedence over individual needs.\
      \ Considerable \nheterogeneity exists within and across most\nethnic subcultures\
      \ and across lines of gender,\nclass, age, and political groups (CSAT, 1999b).\n\
      Subcultures abound in every culture, such as \ngangs; populations that are homeless\
      \ or use \nsubstances; orphaned or disenfranchised peo­\nple; religious, ethnic,\
      \ and sexual minorities;\nindigenous people; and refugee and immigrant\npopulations.\
      \ Some subcultures have more in\ncommon with similar subcultures in other \n\
      countries than with their own cultures (e.g.,\nnonheterosexual populations).\
      \ \nTrauma and substance abuse can themselves \nbe a basis for affiliation with\
      \ a subculture. De \nGirolamo (1993) reports that “disaster subcul­\ntures”\
      \ exist within many cultures. These cul­\ntures of victimization, like all subcultures,\
      \ have \nunique worldviews, codes of conduct, and per­\nceptions of the larger\
      \ society. In a disaster sub­\nculture, people are, to some extent, inured to\n\
      disaster and heedless of warnings of impend­\ning disaster. For example, riverbank\
      \ erosion in\nBangladesh displaces thousands of people each\nyear, yet few believe\
      \ that it is a serious problem \nor that the displacement will be permanent\n\
      (Hutton, 2000). Israelis who have lived with\nunpredictable violence for many\
      \ years behave \ndifferently in public areas and have adapted to\ndifferent\
      \ norms than people who don’t com­\nmonly experience violence (Young, 2001).\
      \ \nMany people identify with more than one \nsubculture. Some identify with\
      \ a particular\nculture or subculture, but not with all of its\nvalues. Individual\
      \ identities are typically a mo­\nsaic of factors, including developmental \n\
      achievements, life experiences, behavioral\nhealth histories, traumatic experiences,\
      \ and \n132"

      \ beliefs in community healing: \n•\nClients carry childhood pain that has led\

      \ and addressed, if relief is to be \nobtained. \n• \nCathartic expression is\
      \ the initial step in the \nhealing journey toward a lifelong pursuit of \n\
      introspection and self-improvement. \n• \nThe healing journey entails reclamation\
      \ of \nindigenous heritage, identity, spirituality, \nand practices to remedy\
      \ the pathogenic ef­\nfects of colonization and other sources of \nhistorical\
      \ trauma. \nSource: Gone, 2009. \nalcohol and illicit drug use; levels of accultura­\n\
      tion and/or assimilation vary from one indi­\nvidual to the next as well. \n\
      Importance of the trauma aftermath \nCounselors working in the immediate after­\n\
      math of trauma—whether individual, group, or\ncommunity in nature—face many\
      \ challenges.\nFor example, survivors may be forced to adjust\nwithout access\
      \ to other health services, em­\nployment, support, or insurance. In these in­\n\
      stances, counselors must often work with \nindividuals and communities coping\
      \ with the\ntrauma while struggling daily to meet basic\nneeds. Research suggests\
      \ that reestablishing\nties to family, community, culture, and spiritual \n\
      systems can not only be vital to the individual,\nbut can also influence the\
      \ impact of the trau­\nma upon future generations. For example,\nBaker and Gippenreiter\
      \ (1998) studied the\ndescendants of people victimized by Joseph\nStalin’s purge.\
      \ They found that families who\nwere able to maintain a sense of connection\
      \ \nand continuity with grandparents affected by \nthe purge experienced fewer\
      \ negative effects \nthan did those who were emotionally or physi­\ncally severed\
      \ from their grandparents. The \nresearchers also found that whether the \n\
      grandparents survived was less important than\nthe connection the grandchildren\
      \ managed to\nkeep to their past. Ties to family and commu­\nnity can also have\
      \ an adverse effect, especially \nif the family or community downplays the \n\
      trauma or blames the victim. Counselors need \nto have a full understanding\
      \ of available sup­\nport before advocating a particular approach. \nTreatment\
      \ strategies \nMany traditional healing ways have been\ndamaged, forgotten,\
      \ or lost—yet much wis­\ndom remains. Drawing on the best traditional \nand\
      \ contemporary approaches to human dis­\ntress and defining culturally competent\
      \ curric­\nula regarding identity and healing (Huriwai,\n2002; Wilson & Tang,\
      \ 2007) both require \nrespect and appreciation for the many ways in\nwhich\
      \ various people characterize and resolve\ntrauma and how they use addictive\
      \ substances \nto bear the burdens of human distress. \nIt is not yet known\
      \ how well existing PTSD\ntreatments work for individuals who identify\nprimarily\
      \ with cultures other than mainstream \nAmerican culture. It is possible that\
      \ such \ntreatments do work for clients of other cul­\ntures, though some cultural\
      \ adaptation and\ntranslation may be required. For example,\nsome PTSD treatments\
      \ that have been used \nwith subculture groups without adaptation\nother than\
      \ language translation and that ap­\npear to be effective across cultures include\
      \ eye\nmovement desensitization and reprocessing\n(Bleich, Gelkopf, & Solomon,\
      \ 2003) and\nSeeking Safety (Daouest et al., 2012). \nGender \nGender differences\
      \ exist in traumatic stress,\nmental disorders, and substance use disorders.\n\
      For example, women have higher rates of\nPTSD, whereas men have higher rates\
      \ of sub­\nstance abuse (Kessler, Chiu, Demler,\nMerikangas, & Walters, 2005;\
      \ Stewart, \nOuimette, & Brown, 2002; Tolin & Foa, 2006). \n133"

      \ Trauma and Substance Abuse \n•\nIn socially appropriate ways, educate clients,\
      \ their loved ones, and possibly members of their \nextended community about\
      \ the relationship between substance abuse and PTSD, how substance \nabuse is\
      \ often used to cope with trauma, and what treatment entails. \n• \nMake serious\
      \ efforts to connect clients to supportive and understanding people (preferably\
      \ within \nculturally identified groups). \n• \nHelp clients understand that\
      \ many who have not experienced trauma or do not have substance \nuse disorders\
      \ will not understand the psychological, spiritual, and interpersonal insights\
      \ that they \nhave gained during their recovery processes. \nTrauma-Informed\
      \ Care in Behavioral Health Services \nThe types of interpersonal trauma experienced\n\
      by men and by women are often different. A\nnumber of studies (Kimerling, Ouimette,\
      \ &\nWeitlauf, 2007) indicate that men experience\nmore combat and crime victimization\
      \ and \nwomen experience more physical and/or sexu­\nal assault—implying that\
      \ men’s traumas often \noccur in public, whereas the traumatization of \nwomen\
      \ is more likely to take place in a private \nsetting, such as a home. Men’s\
      \ abusers are \nmore often strangers. Those who abuse wom­\nen, on the other\
      \ hand, are more often in a rela­\ntionship with them. Women (and girls) often\n\
      are told, “I love you,” during the same time \nperiod when the abuse occurs.\
      \ However, wom­\nen now serve in the military and thus are in­\ncreasingly subject\
      \ to some of the same traumas \nas men and also to military sexual trauma,\n\
      which is much more common for women to \nexperience. Similarly, men can be subject\
      \ to\ndomestic violence or sexual abuse. \nIn treatment, gender considerations\
      \ are rele­\nvant in a variety of ways, including, but not\nlimited to, the\
      \ role and impact of societal gen­\nder stereotypes upon assessment processes,\n\
      treatment initiation, and engagement of ser­\nvices (e.g., peer support systems);\
      \ the selection\nand implementation of gender-specific and \ngender-responsive\
      \ approaches for both men\nand women at each level of intervention; and\nthe\
      \ best selection of trauma-related interven­\ntions that account for gender-specific\
      \ differ­\nences related to traumatic stress. For an \nextensive review and\
      \ discussion of gender-\nspecific and gender-responsive care for trau­\nmatic\
      \ stress and substance use, see the TIP 51,\nSubstance Abuse Treatment: Addressing\
      \ the\nSpecific Needs of Women (CSAT, 2009d), and \nTIP 56, Addressing the Specific\
      \ Behavioral\nHealth Needs of Men (SAMHSA, 2013a). \nBeyond the complexities\
      \ of gender considera­\ntions, one must also consider whether clients \nshould\
      \ be given the choice of working with a\nmale or a female counselor. Some clients\
      \ who \nhave been traumatized have no preference,\nparticularly if their trauma\
      \ wasn’t associated \nwith gender (e.g., a natural disaster, act of ter­\nrorism,\

      \ typically men) can feel uncomfortable \nfor the same reasons, or they may\
      \ feel shame \nwhen talking to men due to feelings evoked\nabout masculinity,\
      \ homosexuality, and so forth.\nHowever, not all clients with trauma histories\
      \ \nprefer female therapists. \nDiscuss with clients the possible risks (e.g.,\n\
      initial emotional discomfort) and benefits of\nbeing treated by a woman or man\

      \ does not de­\ncrease, they can switch to a counselor of the\nopposite gender.\
      \ For group therapy that focuses \non trauma, similar considerations apply.\
      \ Gener­\nally, gender-specific groups are recommended\nwhen possible, but mixed-gender\
      \ groups also\nwork. Gender also comes into play in substance \nabuse treatment.\
      \ Research and clinical observa­\ntion indicate that significant gender differences\n\
      occur in many facets of substance abuse and its \ntreatment. For example, men\
      \ and women expe­\nrience different physical repercussions of sub­\nstance use\
      \ (e.g., women have more health\nproblems), different trajectories (e.g., women\n\
      become addicted more quickly), and different\ntreatment considerations (e.g.,\
      \ traditional sub­\nstance abuse treatment was designed for men). \nSexual orientation\
      \ \nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender\n(LGBT) clients face specific issues\
      \ in behav­\nioral health treatment settings, including his­\ntories of abuse\
      \ and discrimination relating to\nsexual orientation, homophobia in treatment\n\
      on the part of counselors or other clients, po­\ntential difficulty addressing\
      \ traumatic experi­\nences related to their sexuality or sexual \norientation,\
      \ and often, a significant lack of\ntrust toward others. LGBT people sometimes\
      \ \nthink that others can’t understand them and \ntheir specific needs and thus\
      \ are reluctant to\nengage in treatment programs in which the\nclientele is\
      \ predominantly heterosexual. Some\nclients react with judgment, anger, or embar­\n\
      rassment when an LGBT client attempts to\ndescribe sexual trauma relating to\
      \ homosexual \nbehavior, making it even harder for LGBT\nclients to describe\
      \ their experiences. \nOften, individual counseling can address issues \nthe\
      \ LGBT client isn’t comfortable discussing\nin group treatment. “Providing one-on-one\n\
      services may decrease the difficulty of mixing\nheterosexual and LGBT clients\
      \ in treatment \ngroups and decrease the likelihood that hetero­\nsexism or\
      \ homophobia will become an issue”\n(CSAT, 2001, p. 56). For more on treating\n\
      LGBT individuals, see A Provider’s Introduc­\ntion to Substance Abuse Treatment\
      \ for Lesbian,\nGay, Bisexual, and Transgender Individuals\n(CSAT, 2001). \n\
      Making Referrals to \nTrauma-Specific Services \nMany people who experience\
      \ trauma do not\nexhibit persistent traumatic stress symptoms.\nIn fact, people\
      \ do recover on their own. So\nhow do you determine who is at higher risk\n\
      for developing more persistent symptoms of\ntraumatic stress, trauma-related\
      \ disorders, and\ntraumatic stress disorders? One main factor is \nthe severity\
      \ of symptoms at the time of\nscreening and assessment. Other factors, be­\n\
      yond trauma characteristics and pretrauma\nindividual characteristics, to consider\
      \ in mak­\ning referrals include (Ehlers & Clark, 2003):\n•  Cognitive appraisals\
      \ that are excessively \nnegative regarding trauma sequelae, includ­\ning consequences,\
      \ changes after the\nevent(s), responses of other people to the\ntrauma, and\
      \ symptoms. \n•  Acknowledgment of intrusive memories. \n•  Engagement in behaviors\
      \ that reinforce or\nprevent resolution of trauma, including\navoidance, dissociation,\
      \ and substance use. \n•  History of physical consequences of trauma\n(e.g.,\
      \ chronic pain, disfigurement, health\nproblems). \n•  Experiences of more traumas\
      \ or stressful \nlife events after the prior trauma. \n•  Identification of\

      6 Trauma-Specific Services\nThis chapter covers various treatment approaches\
      \ designed specifi­\ncally to treat trauma-related symptoms, trauma-related\
      \ disorders,\nand specific disorders of traumatic stress. The models presented\
      \ do\nnot comprise an exhaustive list, but rather, serve as examples.\nThese\
      \ models require training and supervised experience to be \nconducted safely\
      \ and effectively. The chapter begins with a section\non trauma-specific treatment\
      \ models, providing a brief overview of\ninterventions that can be delivered\
      \ immediately after a trauma, as \nwell as trauma-specific interventions for\
      \ use beyond the immediate \ncrisis. The second segment focuses on integrated\
      \ care that targets \ntrauma-specific treatment for mental, substance use, and\
      \ co-\noccurring disorders. Even though entry-level, trauma-informed \nbehavioral\
      \ health service providers are unlikely to be in a position\nto use these interventions,\
      \ having some knowledge of them is nev­\nertheless important. Currently, more\
      \ research is needed to tease \nout the most important ingredients of early\
      \ interventions and their \nrole in the prevention of more pervasive traumatic\
      \ stress symp­\ntoms. More science-based evidence is available for trauma-specific\
      \ \ntreatments that occur and extend well beyond the immediate reac­\ntions\
      \ to trauma. The last part of the chapter provides a brief review \nof selected\
      \ emerging interventions that have not been covered\nelsewhere in this Treatment\
      \ Improvement Protocol (TIP). \nIntroduction \nTrauma-specific therapies vary\
      \ in their approaches and objectives.\nSome are present focused, some are past\
      \ focused, and some are \ncombinations (Najavits, 2007a). Present-focused approaches\
      \ pri­\nmarily address current coping skills, psychoeducation, and manag­\n\
      ing symptoms for better functioning. Past-focused approaches\nprimarily focus\
      \ on telling the trauma story to understand the im­\npact of the trauma on how\
      \ the person functions today, experienc­\ning emotions that were too overwhelming\
      \ to experience in the past,\nand helping clients more effectively cope in the\
      \ present with their \n137"

      \ approaches may reveal some \nof their stories; past-focused approaches em­\n\
      phasize how understanding the past influences \ncurrent behavior, emotion, and\
      \ thinking,\nthereby helping clients cope more effectively \nwith traumatic\
      \ experiences in the present. \nThe distinction between these approaches lies\
      \ \nin the primary emphasis of the approach. De­\npending on the nature of the\
      \ trauma and the\nspecific needs of the client, one approach may \nbe more suitable\
      \ than the other. For instance,\nin short-term treatment for clients in early\
      \ \nrecovery from mental illness and/or substance \nabuse, present-focused,\
      \ cognitive–behavioral,\nor psychoeducational approaches are generally \nmore\
      \ appropriate. For clients who are stable in\ntheir recovery and have histories\
      \ of develop­\nmental trauma where much of the trauma has \nbeen repressed,\
      \ a past-focused orientation may \nbe helpful. Some clients may benefit from\
      \ \nboth types, either concurrently or sequentially. \nThis chapter discusses\
      \ a number of treatment\nmodels, general approaches, and techniques. A\ntreatment\
      \ model is a set of practices designed\nto alleviate symptoms, promote psychological\
      \ \nwell-being, or restore mental health. Treat­\nment techniques are specific\
      \ procedures that\ncan be used as part of a variety of models.\nSome models\
      \ and techniques described in this \nchapter can be used with groups, some with\n\
      individuals, and some with both. This chapter\nis selective rather than comprehensive;\
      \ addi­\ntional models are described in the literature. \nSee, for example,\
      \ the PILOTS database on the \nWeb site of the National Center for PTSD \n138\n\

      \ \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) re­\nspond to disasters. Behavioral health\

      \ funding for food, shelter, and immediate \nneeds, whereas FEMA assistance\
      \ r equires a \nperiod of gearing up but provides for longer-\nterm needs. SAMHSA,\

      \ Services \n(NCPTSD; http://www.ptsd.va.gov) for \ntreatment literature related\

      \ De­\nveloping Trauma-Informed Behavioral Health\nSystems and Trauma-Specific\
      \ Services (Center \nfor Mental Health Services, 2008). \nSome treatments discussed\
      \ in this chapter are\ndescribed as evidence based. Because research \non integrated\
      \ treatment models is so new, many \nhave only been examined in a few studies.\
      \ Giv­\nen these circumstances and the fact that an \noutcome study provides\
      \ only limited evidence\nof efficacy, the term “evidence based” should be\n\
      interpreted cautiously. Additional scientific\nstudy is needed to determine\
      \ whether some \ntreatments discussed herein are, in fact, evi­\ndence based.\
      \ A good resource for evaluating\nevidence-based, trauma-specific treatment\n\
      models is Effective Treatments for PTSD (Foa, \nKeane, Friedman, & Cohen, 2009).\
      \ Although \nevidence-based interventions should be a pri­\nmary consideration\
      \ in selecting appropriate\ntreatment models for people with symptoms of\ntrauma\
      \ that co-occur with mental and sub­\nstance use disorders (see Allen, 2001,\
      \ for an\nindepth discussion of trauma and serious men­\ntal illness), other\
      \ factors must also be weighed,\nincluding the specific treatment needs of the\
      \ \nclient; his or her history of trauma, psychosocial \nand cultural background,\
      \ and experiences in\nprior trauma treatment; the overall treatment\nplan for\
      \ the client; and the competencies of the \nprogram’s clinical staff. Although\
      \ behavioral\nhealth counselors can prepare to help their cli­\nents address\
      \ some of the issues discussed in \nChapter 5, specialized training is necessary\
      \ to\nprovide treatment for co-occurring substance \nuse and mental disorders\
      \ related to trauma. \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser­\nvices Administration\
      \ (SAMHSA) has created\nthe National Registry of Evidence-Based Pro-\ngrams\
      \ and Practices (NREPP) as a resource for\nreviewing and identifying effective\
      \ treatment\nprograms. Programs can be nominated for con­\nsideration as co-occurring\
      \ disorders programs\nor substance abuse prevention or treatment\nprograms,\
      \ and their quality of evidence, readi­\nness for dissemination, and training\
      \ considera­\ntions are then reviewed. For more detailed \ninformation, including\

      \ to go to a town approximately 30 miles away because a \nlevee had broken….\
      \ By 6:00 a.m., my colleagues and I were there with many of the townspeople,\
      \ with \nhelicopters flying overhead, with t rucks going in and out by the main\
      \ road trying to empty the factories. \nWhen we got there, as far as you could\
      \ see was farmland. By 11 a.m., you could see a ‘lake’ in the dis­\ntance. By\
      \ 2 p.m., the water was on the edge of the town. Being there, at that town,\
      \ before, during, and \nafter the water came was probably the most valuable\
      \ function we performed. We were able to share in \nthe grief of the hundreds\
      \ of people as we stayed with them while their fields, houses, and workplaces\
      \ \nwere flooded. We witnessed the death of a town, and the people reacted with\
      \ disbelief, anger, sad­\nness, and numbness. Each person had a different story,\
      \ but all grieved, and we provided many an op­\nportunity to express it. People\
      \ cried as the water started rising into their houses. Some had to watch. \n\
      Some had to leave. At times it was utterly silent as we all waited. There was\
      \ a woman whose parents \nsent her away during the floods of ‘43 and she had\
      \ been angry for 50 years about it. She was deter­\nmined that her children\
      \ and grandchildren would see everything. I spent 12 hours that day just giving\
      \ \nsupport, listening, giving information, and sometimes shedding a tear or\
      \ two myself.” \n—Rosemary Schwartzbard, Ph.D., responder to floods along the\

      \ with\nlocal agencies prior to other organizations ar­\nriving on the scene.\
      \ Law enforcement is likely \nto take a primary role on site. Whether it is\
      \ a\ndisaster, group trauma, or individual trauma \n(including a trauma that\
      \ affects an entire fami­\nly, such as a house fire), a hierarchy of needs \n\
      should be established: survival, safety, security,\nfood, shelter, health (physical\
      \ and mental), ori­\nentation of survivors to immediate local ser­\nvices, and\
      \ communication with family, friends,\nand community (National Institute of\
      \ Mental\nHealth, 2002). In this crucial time, appropriate\ninterventions include\
      \ educating survivors about\nresources; educating other providers, such as\n\
      faith-based organizations and social service\ngroups, to screen for increased\
      \ psychological \neffects including use of substances; and use of a\ntrauma\
      \ response team that assists clients with\ntheir immediate needs. No formal\
      \ interventions \nshould be attempted at this time, but a profes­\nsionally\
      \ trained, empathic listener can offer\nsolace and support (Litz & Gray, 2002).\
      \ \nBasic needs \nBasic necessities, such as shelter, food, and\nwater, are\
      \ key to survival and a sense of safety.\nIt is important to focus on meeting\
      \ these basic\nneeds and on providing a supportive environ­\nment. Clients’\
      \ access to prescribed medications \nmay be interrupted after a trauma, particularly\
      \ \na disaster, so providers should identify clients’ \nmedication needs for\
      \ preexisting physical and\nmental disorders, including methadone or \nother\
      \ pharmacological treatment for substance \nuse. For example, after September\
      \ 11, 2001,\nsubstance abuse treatment program adminis­\ntrators in New York\
      \ had to seek alternative \nmethadone administration options (Frank,\nDewart,\

      \ first aid provided in the \nfirst 48 hours after a disaster is designed to\n\
      ensure safety, provide an emotionally support­\nive environment and activities,\
      \ identify those \nwith high-risk reactions, and facilitate com­\nmunication,\
      \ including strong, reassuring lead­\nership immediately after the event. The\
      \ \nprimary helping response of psychological first\naid is to provide a calm,\
      \ caring, and supportive\nenvironment to set the scene for psychological \n\
      recovery. It is also essential that all those first \nresponding to a trauma—rescue\
      \ workers, med­\nical professionals, behavioral health workers \n(including\

      \ additional assistance. \n•  Provide a positive experience that will in­\n\
      crease their chances of seeking help if they \nneed it in the future. \nClinical\
      \ experience suggests that care be taken\nto respect a survivor’s individual\

      \ 326 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 164]\nA widely accepted framework in treating \n\
      trauma, substance use disorders, and \nmental illness categorizes therapies\
      \ as \nsingle (treatment of only one disorder), \nsequential (treatment of one\
      \ disorder first, \nthen the other), or parallel (concurrent \ntreatment of\
      \ multiple disorders delivered \nby separate clinicians or in separate \nprograms\
      \ that do not necessarily address \nthe interactions between symptoms and \n\
      disorders). \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nresults were\
      \ not conducted with first respond­\ners; that is, CISD may be appropriate for\n\
      some, but not all, groups. A recent study of\n952 U.S. peacekeepers and CISD\
      \ by the U.S.\nArmy Research Unit–Europe (Adler et al.,\n2008) found mixed results.\
      \ \nInterventions Beyond the Initial \nResponse to Trauma \nIn the interest\
      \ of increasing your overall famil­\niarity with relevant approaches, the following\n\
      sections review several traumatic stress treat­\nment approaches that counselors\
      \ will most\nlikely encounter when collaborating with cli­\nnicians or agencies\
      \ that specialize in trauma-\nspecific services and treating traumatic stress.\
      \ \nCognitive–behavioral therapies \nMost PTSD models involve cognitive–\nbehavioral\
      \ therapy (CBT) that integrates cog­\nnitive and behavioral theories by incorporating\n\
      two ideas: first, that cognitions (or thoughts)\nmediate between situational\
      \ demands and \none’s attempts to respond to them effectively,\nand second,\
      \ that behavioral change influences \nacceptance of altered cognitions about\
      \ oneself\nor a situation and establishment of newly \nlearned cognitive–behavioral\
      \ interaction pat­\nterns. In practice, CBT uses a wide range of\ncoping strategies.\
      \ \nThere are many different varieties of CBT.\nCBT originated in the 1970s\
      \ (Beck, Rush, \nShaw & Emery, 1979; Ellis & Harper, 1975) \nand has expanded\
      \ since then to address vari­\nous populations, including people who use \n\
      substances, people who experience anxiety,\npeople with PTSD or personality\
      \ disorders,\nchildren and adolescents, individuals involved\nin the criminal\
      \ justice system, and many oth­\ners. CBT has also been expanded to include\
      \ \nvarious techniques, coping skills, and ap­\nproaches, such as dialectical\
      \ behavior therapy\n(DBT; Linehan, 1993), Seeking Safety \n(Najavits, 2002a),\
      \ and mindfulness (Segal, \nWilliams, & Teasdale, 2002). Traditional CBT\nemphasizes\
      \ symptom reduction or resolution,\nbut recent CBT approaches have also empha­\n\
      sized the therapeutic relationship, a particular­\nly important dynamic in trauma\
      \ treatment\n( Jackson, Nissenson, & Cloitre, 2009). \nCBT has been applied\
      \ to the treatment of\ntrauma and has also been widely and effective­\nly used\
      \ in the treatment of substance use. A\nreview of efficacy research on CBT for\
      \ PTSD\nis provided by Rothbaum, Meadows, Resick,\nand Foy (2000). Najavits\
      \ and colleagues\n(2009) and O’Donnell and Cook (2006) offer\nan overview of\
      \ CBT therapies for treating\nPTSD and substance abuse. In addition, a free\n\
      online training resource incorporating CBT \nfor traumatized children within\
      \ the communi­\nty, Trauma-Focused CBT, is available from \nthe Medical University\
      \ of South Carolina\n(http://tfcbt.musc.edu/). \nCognitive processing therapy\
      \ \nCognitive processing therapy (CPT) is a\nmanualized 12-session treatment\
      \ approach\nthat can be administered in a group or indi­\nvidual setting (Resick\
      \ & Schnicke, 1992,\n1993). CPT was developed for rape survivors\nand combines\
      \ elements of existing treatments\nfor PTSD, specifically exposure therapy (see\
      \ \nthe “Exposure Therapy” section later in this\nchapter) and cognitive therapy.\

      \ Biofeedback, and Breathing \nRetraining Strategies \nRelaxation training,\
      \ biofeedback, and breathing retraining strategies may help some clients cope\
      \ with \nanxiety, a core symptom of t raumatic stress. However, no evidence\
      \ supports the use of relaxation \nand biofeedback as effective standalone PTSD\
      \ treatment techniques (Cahill, Rothbaum, Resick, & \nFollete, 2009). Both are\
      \ sometimes used as complementary strategies to manage anxiety symptoms \nelicited\
      \ by trauma-related stimuli. Breathing retraining uses focused or controlled\
      \ breathing to re­\nduce arousal. Breathing retraining and relaxation, along\
      \ with other interventions when necessary, can \nhelp clients with ASD. An important\
      \ caution in the use of breath work with trauma clients is that it can \nsometimes\
      \ act as a trigger—for example, given its focus on the body and its potential\
      \ to remind \nthem of heavy breathing that occurred during assault. Biofeedback,\
      \ which requires specialized \nequipment, combines stress reduction strategies\
      \ (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation, guided image­\nry) with feedback from\
      \ biological system measures (e.g., heart rate, hand temperature) that gauge\
      \ \nlevels of stress or anxiety reduction. Relaxation training, which requires\
      \ no specialized equipment, \nencourages clients to reduce anxiety responses\
      \ (including physiological responses) to trauma-related \nstimuli; it is often\
      \ part of more comprehensive PTSD treatments (e.g., prolonged exposure and stress\
      \ \ninoculation training [SIT]). \nPart 1, Chapter 6—Trauma-Specific Services\

      \ sensations, and\nemotions that were experienced during the \nevent. The client\
      \ then reads the narrative \naloud during a session and at home. The cog­\n\
      nitive therapy aspect of CPT uses six key \nPTSD themes identified by McCann\
      \ and\nPearlman (1990): safety, trust, power, control, \nesteem, and intimacy.\
      \ The client is guided to\nidentify cognitive distortions in these areas,\n\
      such as maladaptive beliefs. \nResults from randomized, placebo-controlled \n\
      trials for the treatment of PTSD related to \ninterpersonal violence (Resick,\
      \ 2001; Resick,\nNishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002) sup­\nport the use of\
      \ CPT. CPT and prolonged\nexposure therapy models are equally and high­\nly\
      \ positive in treating PTSD and depression in\nrape survivors; CPT is superior\
      \ in reducing\nguilt (Nishith, Resick, & Griffin, 2002;\nResick et al., 2002;\
      \ Resick, Nishith, &\nGriffin, 2003). CPT has shown positive out­\ncomes with\
      \ refugees when administered in the \nrefugees’ native language (Schulz, Marovic-\n\
      Johnson, & Huber, 2006) and with veterans \n(Monson et al., 2006). However,\
      \ CPT has not \nbeen studied with high-complexity popula­\ntions such as individuals\
      \ with substance de­\npendence, homelessness, current domestic\nviolence, serious\
      \ and persistent mental illness,\nor suicidality. CPT requires a 3-day training\n\
      plus consultation (Karlin et al., 2010). Resick \nand Schicke (1996) published\
      \ a CPT treat­\nment manual, Cognitive Processing Therapy for\nRape Victims:\
      \ A Treatment Manual. \nExposure therapy \nExposure therapy for PTSD asks clients\
      \ to\ndirectly describe and explore trauma-related \nmemories, objects, emotions,\
      \ or places. In­\ntense emotions are evoked (e.g., sadness, anxi­\nety) but\
      \ eventually decrease, desensitizing\nclients through repeated encounters with\n\
      traumatic material. Careful monitoring of the\npace and appropriateness of exposure-based\n\
      interventions is necessary to prevent retrauma­\ntization (clients can become\
      \ conditioned to\nfear the trauma-related material even more).\nClients must\
      \ have ample time to process their\nmemories and integrate cognition and affect,\n\
      so some sessions can last for 1.5 hours or \nmore. For simple cases, exposure\
      \ can work in\nas few as 9 sessions; more complex cases may \nrequire 20 or\

      \ or when appropriate (e.g., the closure \nprocess is meant to be conducted\

      \ \n• \nPhase 8: Reevaluation \nSource: EMDR Network, 2012. \nAdvice to Counselors:\
      \ Steps for \nIntroducing a Breathing Exercise \nUse the following statements\
      \ to lead clients \nthrough a breathing exercise:  \n•\nPlace your hands on\
      \ your stomach. As you \ninhale, breathe deeply but slowly so that \nyour hands\
      \ rise with your stomach. As you \nexhale slowly, practice breathing so that\
      \ \nyour hands drop with your stomach.  \n• \nInhale slowly through your nose\
      \ with your \nmouth closed; don’t rush or force in the air.  \n• \nExhale slowly\
      \ through your mouth with \nyour lips in the whistling position. \n• \nBreathe\
      \ out for twice as long as you \nbreathe in. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral\
      \ Health Services \nexpose the client to traumatic material. Two\nof the more\
      \ common methods are exposure \nthrough imagery and in vivo (“real life”) \n\
      exposure. \nThe effectiveness of exposure therapy has \nbeen firmly established\
      \ (Rothbaum et al.,\n2000); however, adverse reactions to exposure \ntherapy\
      \ have also been noted. Some individu­\nals who have experienced trauma exhibit\
      \ an\nexacerbation of symptoms during or following\nexposure treatments. Even\
      \ so, the exacerba­\ntion may depend on counselor variables during\nadministration.\
      \ Practitioners of exposure ther­\napy need comprehensive training to master\
      \ its \ntechniques (Karlin et al., 2010); a counselor\nunskilled in the methods\
      \ of this treatment \nmodel can not only fail to help his or her cli­\nents,\
      \ but also cause symptoms to worsen. \nExposure therapy is recommended as a\
      \ first-\nline treatment option when the prominent\ntrauma symptoms are intrusive\
      \ thoughts, \nflashbacks, or trauma-related fears, panic, and \navoidance. However,\
      \ counselors should exer­\ncise caution when using exposure with clients \n\
      who have not maintained stability in manag­\ning mental illness symptoms or\
      \ abstinence \nfrom substance use disorders. Studies and rou­\ntine use of exposure\
      \ have consistently excluded\nhigh-complexity clients such as those with \n\
      substance dependence, homelessness, current\ndomestic violence, serious and\
      \ persistent men­\ntal illness, or suicidality. The only trial of ex­\nposure\
      \ therapy with a substance dependence \nsample found that it did not outperform\
      \ \nstandard substance abuse treatment on most \nvariables (Mills et al., 2012).\
      \ \nProlonged exposure therapy for PTSD is \nlisted in SAMHSA’s NREPP. For reviews\
      \ of \nexposure therapy, also see Najavits (2007a) \nand Institute of Medicine\
      \ (2008). In addition\nto prolonged exposure therapy, other therapies \nincorporate\
      \ exposure and desensitization tech­\nniques, including eye movement desensitiza­\n\
      tion and reprocessing (EMDR; Shapiro, \n2001), cognitive processing, and systematic\n\
      desensitization therapies (Wolpe, 1958). \nEye movement desensitization and\
      \ \nreprocessing \nEMDR (Shapiro, 2001) is one of the most\nwidely used therapies\
      \ for trauma and PTSD.\nThe treatment protocols of EMDR have\nevolved into sophisticated\
      \ paradigms requiring\ntraining and, preferably, clinical supervision.\nEMDR\

      frameworks, including psychoneurology, CBT, \ninformation processing, and nonverbal\
      \ repre­\nsentation of traumatic memories. The goal of\nthis therapy is to process\
      \ the experiences that\nare causing problems and distress. It is an ef­\nfective\
      \ treatment for PTSD (Seidler &\nWagner, 2006) and is accepted as an evidence-\n\
      based practice by the U.S. Department of\nVeterans Affairs (VA), the Royal College\
      \ of\nPsychiatrists, and the International Society for\nTraumatic Stress Studies\
      \ (Najavits, 2007a); \nnumerous reviews support its effectiveness \n(e.g., Mills\
      \ et al., 2012). EMDR values the \ndevelopment of “resource installation” (calming\n\
      procedures) and engages in exposure work to\ndesensitize clients to traumatic\
      \ material, using\nexternal tracking techniques across the visual \nfield to\
      \ assist in processing distressing materi­\nal. Training in EMDR, available\
      \ through the\nEMDR Institute, is required before counselors \nuse this treatment.\
      \ It is listed in SAMHSA’s \nNREPP (EMDR Network, 2012). Thus far,\nthere is\
      \ no study examining the use of EMDR\nwith clients in substance abuse treatment.\
      \ See \nPart 3 of this TIP, available online, to review\nempirical work on EMDR.\
      \ \nNarrative therapy \nNarrative therapy is an emerging approach to\nunderstanding\
      \ human growth and change; it is\nfounded on the premise that individuals are\
      \ \nthe experts on their own lives and can access \ntheir existing intrapsychic\
      \ and interpersonal \nresources to reduce the impact of problems in\ntheir lives.\
      \ Developed for the treatment of\nPTSD resulting from political or community\
      \ \nviolence, narrative therapy is based on CBT\nprinciples, particularly exposure\
      \ therapy\n(Neuner, Schauer, Elbert, & Roth, 2002;\nNeuner, Schauer, Klaschik,\
      \ Karunakara, & \nElbert, 2004). This approach views psycho­\ntherapy not as\
      \ a scientific practice, but as a \nnatural extension of healing practices that\n\
      have been present throughout human history.\nFor a trauma survivor, the narrative,\
      \ as it is \ntold and retold, expresses the traumatic expe­\nrience, puts the\
      \ trauma in the context of the\nsurvivor’s life, and defines the options he\
      \ or \nshe has for change. Narrative structure helps \nclients connect events\
      \ in their lives, reveals \nstrings of events, explores alternative expres­\n\
      sions of trauma, evokes explanations for cli­\nents’ behaviors, and identifies\
      \ their knowledge \nand skills. The use of stories in therapy, with\nthe client\
      \ as the storyteller, generally helps \nlessen suffering (McLeod, 1997; White,\
      \ 2004). \nSkills training in affective and \ninterpersonal regulation \nSkills\
      \ training in affective and interpersonal \nregulation (STAIR) is a two-phase\
      \ cognitive–\nbehavioral model that adapts therapies devel­\noped by others\
      \ into a new package (Cloitre,\nKoenen, Cohen, & Han, 2002). Phase 1 con­\n\

      and identifying feelings, emotion manage­\nment, distress tolerance, acceptance\
      \ of feel­\nings, identifying trauma-based interpersonal \nschemas, identifying\
      \ conflict between trauma-\ngenerated feelings and current interpersonal \n\

      \ family deal with feelings? How did the client’s family life \naffect his or\
      \ her present difficulty experiencing and identifying feeling? \n• \nEmotion\
      \ regulation skills: Identify the cognitive, behavioral, and social support\

      \ strengths and weaknesses in \neach coping modality. Teach skills such as breathing\
      \ retraining, self-statements to reduce fear, \nand social skill training to\
      \ improve social support.  \n• \nAcceptance and tolerance of negative affect:\

      \ response flexibility based on relative power in each relationship.  \nOnce\
      \ Phase 1 of STAIR is well learned, clients move to Phase 2, which involves\

      \ and on a preventative basis to \n“inoculate” individuals to future and \n\
      ongoing stressors (Meichenbaum, 1996). \nThis practice as a preventive strategy\

      \ 326 total\n\n---\n\n[Page 169]\nAdvice to Counselors: SIT Phases \nSIT is\
      \ a prevention and treatment approach that has three overlapping phases. It\
      \ is often seen as a \ncomplementary approach to other interventions for traumatic\
      \ stress. \nPhase 1: Conceptualization and education. This phase has two main\
      \ objectives. The initial goal is to \ndevelop a collaborative relationship\
      \ that supports and encourages the client to confront stressors \nand learn\
      \ new coping strategies. The next objective is to increase the client’s understanding\
      \ of the \nnature and impact of his or her stress and awareness of alternative\
      \ coping skills. Many cognitive \nstrategies are used to meet these objectives,\
      \ including self-monitoring activities, Socratic question­\ning, identifying\
      \ strengths and evidence of resilience, and modeling of coping strategies. \n\
      Phase 2: Skill acquisition and rehearsal. This phase focuses on developing coping\
      \ skills and using \ncoping skills that the individual already possesses. This\
      \ process includes practice across settings, so \nthat the individual begins\
      \ to generalize the use of his or her skills across situations through rehearsal,\
      \ \nrehearsal, and more rehearsal.  \nPhase 3: Implementation and following\
      \ through. The main objective is to create more challenging \ncircumstances\
      \ that elicit higher stress levels for the client. By gradually increasing the\
      \ challenge, the \nclient can practice coping strategies that mimic more realistic\
      \ circumstances. Through successful \nnegotiation, the client builds a greater\
      \ sense of self-efficacy. Common strategies in this phase include \nimagery\
      \ and behavioral rehearsal, modeling, role-playing, and graded in vivo exposure.\
      \ \nSource: Meichenbaum, 2007. \nPart 1, Chapter 6—Trauma-Specific Services\
      \ \n“STOP” and then redirecting thoughts in a\nmore positive direction]), and\
      \ skills applica­\ntion. The goal is to help clients learn to man­\nage their\
      \ anxiety and to decrease avoidant\nbehavior by using effective coping strategies.\n\
      Randomized controlled clinical trials have \nindicated that SIT reduces the\
      \ severity of\nPTSD compared with waitlist controls and\nshows comparable efficacy\
      \ to exposure therapy.\nAt follow-up (up to 12 months after treat­\nment), gains\
      \ were maintained (Foa et al., \n1999; Foa, Rothbaum, Riggs, & Murdock, \n1991).\
      \ \nOther therapies \nNumerous interventions introduced in the \npast 20 years\
      \ focus on traumatic stress. For\nsome interventions, the evidence is limited,\n\
      and for other others, it is evolving. One exam­\nple is the traumatic incident\
      \ reduction (TIR) \napproach. This brief memory-oriented inter­\nvention is\
      \ designed for children, adolescents,\nand adults who have experienced traumatic\n\
      stress (Valentine & Smith, 2001). Listed in \nSAMHSA’s NREPP, the intervention\
      \ is de­\nsigned to process specific traumatic incidents\nor problematic themes\
      \ related to the trauma,\nincluding specific feelings, emotions, sensa­\ntions,\
      \ attitudes, or pain. It involves having cli­\nents talk through the traumatic\
      \ incident \nrepeatedly with the anticipation that changes\nin affect will occur\
      \ throughout the repetitions.\nTIR is a client-centered approach. \nIntegrated\
      \ Models for \nTrauma \nThis section covers models specifically de­\nsigned\
      \ to treat trauma-related symptoms along\nwith either mental or substance use\
      \ disorders \nat the same time. Integrated treatments help\nclients work on\
      \ several presenting problems \nsimultaneously throughout the treatment, a\n\
      promising and recommended strategy (Dass-\nBrailsford & Myrick, 2010; Najavits,\
      \ 2002b;\nNixon & Nearmy, 2011). Thus far, research is \nlimited, but what is\
      \ available suggests that \nintegrated treatment models effectively reduce \n\

      \ TIP 42, Substance \nAbuse Treatment for Persons With Co-Occurring \nDisorders\
      \ (Center for Substance Abuse Treat­\nment, 2005c), offers a detailed description\
      \ of \nintegrated treatment. In contrast with inte­\ngrated models, other model\
      \ types include sin­\ngle (treatment of only one disorder),\nsequential (treatment\
      \ of one disorder first,\nthen the other), or parallel (concurrent treat­\n\
      ment of multiple disorders delivered by sepa­\nrate clinicians or in separate\
      \ programs that do\nnot necessarily address the interactions be­\ntween symptoms\
      \ and disorders). \nSimilar to single models, integrated treatment \nmodels\
      \ are designed for use in a variety of \nsettings (e.g., outpatient, day treatment,\n\
      and/or residential substance abuse and mental \nhealth clinics/programs). Most\
      \ models listed\nare manual-based treatments that address \ntrauma-related symptoms,\
      \ mental disorders,\nand substance use disorders at the same time. \nAdditional\
      \ approaches and further details on\nthe selected approaches can be found at\n\
      NREPP (http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov). \nAddiction and Trauma Recovery \nIntegration\
      \ Model \nThe Addiction and Trauma Recovery Inte­\ngrated Model (ATRIUM; Miller\
      \ & Guidry,\n2001) integrates CBT and relational treatment\nthrough an emphasis\
      \ on mental, physical, and\nspiritual health. This 12-week model for indi­\n\
      viduals and groups blends psychoeducational, \nprocess, and expressive activities,\
      \ as well as \ninformation on the body’s responses to addic­\ntion and traumatic\
      \ stress and the impact of\ntrauma and addiction on the mind and spirit.\nIt\
      \ helps clients explore anxiety, sexuality, self-\nharm, depression, anger,\
      \ physical complaints \nand ailments, sleep difficulties, relationship\nchallenges,\
      \ and spiritual disconnection. It was \ndesigned primarily for women and focuses\
      \ on\ndevelopmental (childhood) trauma and inter­\npersonal violence, but it\
      \ recognizes that other\ntypes of traumatic events occur. \nThe ATRIUM model\
      \ consists of three phases \nof treatment. The first stage, or “outer circle,”\n\
      consists of the counselor collecting data from \nthe client about his or her\
      \ trauma history, of­\nfering psychoeducation on the nature of trau­\nma, and\
      \ helping the client assess personal \nstrengths. ATRIUM actively discourages\
      \ the \nevocation of memories of abuse or other trau­\nma events in this phase.\
      \ The second stage, or\n“middle circle,” allows clients and counselors \nto\
      \ address trauma symptoms more directly and\nspecifically encourages clients\
      \ to reach out to\nand engage with support resources in the \ncommunity. The\
      \ middle circle also emphasiz­\nes learning new information about trauma and\n\
      developing additional coping skills. The third\nstage of the program, the “inner\
      \ circle,” focus­\nes on challenging old beliefs that arose as a\nresult of\
      \ the trauma. For instance, the concept\nof “nonprotecting bystander” is used\
      \ to repre­\nsent the lack of support that the traumatized\nperson experienced\
      \ at the time of the trauma.\nThis representation is replaced with the “pro­\n\
      tective presence” of supportive others today. \nATRIUM was used in one of the\
      \ nine study \nsites of SAMHSA’s Women, Co-Occurring\nDisorders and Violence\
      \ Study. Across all sites,\ntrauma-specific models achieved more favora­\nble\
      \ outcomes than control sites that did not \nuse trauma-specific models (Morrissey\
      \ et al., \n2005). There has not yet been a study of \nATRIUM per se, however.\
      \ A manual describ­\ning the theory behind this model in greater\ndepth, as\
      \ well as how to implement it, is pub­\nlished under the title Addictions and\
      \ Trauma \nRecovery: Healing the Body, Mind, and Spirit\n(Miller & Guidry, 2001).\

      \ \nBeyond Trauma: A Healing \nJourney for Women \nBeyond Trauma (Covington,\
      \ 2003) is a curric­\nulum for women’s services based on theory,\nresearch,\
      \ and clinical experience. It was devel­\noped for use in residential, outpatient,\
      \ and\ncorrectional settings; domestic violence pro­\ngrams; and mental health\
      \ clinics. It uses \nbehavioral techniques and expressive arts and\nis based\
      \ on relational therapy. Although the\nmaterials are designed for trauma treatment,\n\
      the connection between trauma and substance \nabuse in women’s lives is a theme\
      \ throughout.\nBeyond Trauma has a psychoeducational com­\nponent that defines\
      \ trauma by way of its pro­\ncess as well as its impact on the inner self\n\
      (thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values) and the \nouter self (behavior and relationships,\
      \ includ­\ning parenting). Coping skills are emphasized;\nspecific exercises\
      \ develop emotional wellness. \nConcurrent Treatment of PTSD \nand Cocaine Dependence\
      \ \nConcurrent Treatment of PTSD and Cocaine \nDependence (CTPCD) is a 16-session,\
      \ twice-\nweekly individual outpatient psychotherapy \nmodel designed to treat\
      \ women and men with\nco-occurring PTSD and cocaine dependence\n(Coffey, Schumacher,\
      \ Brimo, & Brady, 2005). \nCTPCD combines imagery and in vivo expo­\nsure therapy\
      \ (in which the client becomes de­\nsensitized to anxiety-producing stimuli\n\
      through repeated exposure to them) for the\ntreatment of PTSD with elements\
      \ of CBT for \nsubstance dependence. To balance the dual \nneeds of abstinence\
      \ skill building and prompt\ntrauma treatment, the first five sessions focus\
      \ \non coping skills for cocaine dependence. Ses­\nsion six transitions into\
      \ exposure therapy,\nwhich begins in earnest in session seven and is \ncombined\
      \ with CBT for the treatment of sub­\nstance abuse. \nCTPCD helps reduce substance\
      \ use and\nPTSD symptoms. The use of any illicit drug,\nas measured by urine\
      \ screens, was quite low \nduring the 16-week treatment trial and didn’t \n\
      escalate during the second half of treatment—\nwhen most exposure sessions occurred.\
      \ PTSD\nsymptoms dropped significantly over the \ncourse of treatment, as did\
      \ self-reported de­\npressive symptoms; however, the dropout rate\nwas high\
      \ (Coffey, Dansky, & Brady, 2003).\nCTPCD was reformulated into Concurrent \n\
      Prolonged Exposure (COPE; Mills et al.,\n2012), which was compared with treatment\
      \ as \nusual in a high-complexity clinical sample of \nindividuals who had PTSD\
      \ and substance \ndependence. Both treatment conditions result­\ned in improvements\
      \ in PTSD with no differ­\nence at 3 months (though COPE showed \nsignificantly\
      \ greater improvement at 9\nmonths); moreover, the two conditions did not \n\
      differ in impact on substance use outcomes,\ndepression, or anxiety. \nIntegrated\
      \ CBT \nIntegrated CBT is a 14-session individual \ntherapy model designed for\
      \ PTSD and sub­\nstance use. It incorporates elements such as \npsychoeducation,\
      \ cognitive restructuring, and\nbreathing retraining (McGovern, Lamber-\nHarris,\
      \ Alterman, Xie, & Meier, 2011). A ran­\ndomized controlled trial showed that\
      \ both \nintegrated CBT and individual addiction\ntreatment achieved improvements\
      \ in substance \nuse and other measures of psychiatric symp­\ntom severity with\
      \ no difference between the \ntreatments. \nSeeking Safety \nSeeking Safety\
      \ is an empirically validated,\npresent-focused treatment model that helps \n\
      clients attain safety from trauma and substance\nabuse (Najavits, 2002a). The\
      \ Seeking Safety\nmanual (Najavits, 2002b) offers clinician guide­\nlines and\

      \ in all settings \nand levels of care, by all clinicians, for all types \n\
      of trauma and substance abuse. \nSeeking Safety covers 25 topics that address\n\
      cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and case\nmanagement domains. The topics\
      \ can be \nconducted in any order, using as few or as \nmany as are possible\
      \ within a client’s course of \ntreatment. Each topic represents a coping skill\
      \ \nrelevant to both trauma and substance abuse,\nsuch as compassion, taking\
      \ good care of your­\nself, healing from anger, coping with triggers,\nand asking\
      \ for help. This treatment model\nbuilds hope through an emphasis on ideals\
      \ \nand simple, emotionally evocative language \nand quotations. It attends\
      \ to clinician process­\nes and offers concrete strategies that are \nthought\
      \ to be essential for clients dealing with\nconcurrent substance use disorders\
      \ and histo­\nries of trauma. \nMore than 20 published studies (which include\
      \ \npilot studies, randomized controlled trials, and\nmultisite trials representing\
      \ various investiga­\ntors and populations) provide the evidence base \nfor\
      \ this treatment model. For more infor­\nmation, see SAMHSA’s NREPP Web site\

      \ Study samples included peo­\nple with chronic, severe trauma symptoms and\n\
      substance dependence who were diverse in\nethnicity and were treated in a range\
      \ of set­\ntings (e.g., criminal justice, VA centers, adoles­\ncent treatment,\
      \ homelessness services, public\nsector). Seeking Safety has shown positive\
      \ \noutcomes on trauma symptoms, substance \nabuse, and other domains (e.g.,\
      \ suicidality,\nHIV risk, social functioning, problem-solving, \nsense of meaning);\
      \ consistently outperformed\ntreatment as usual; and achieved high satisfac­\n\
      tion ratings from both clients and clinicians. It\nhas been translated into\
      \ seven languages, and a \nversion for blind and/or dyslexic individuals is\n\
      available. \nThe five key elements of Seeking Safety are:\n1.  Safety as the\
      \ overarching goal (helping\nclients attain safety in their relationships,\n\
      thinking, behavior, and emotions). \n2.  Integrated treatment (working on trauma\n\
      and substance abuse at the same time). \n3.  A focus on ideals to counteract\
      \ the loss of \nideals in both trauma and substance abuse. \n4.  Four content\
      \ areas: cognitive, behavioral,\ninterpersonal, and case management. \n5.  Attention\
      \ to clinician processes (address­\ning countertransference, self-care, and\
      \ \nother issues). \nSubstance Dependence PTSD \nTherapy \nSubstance Dependence\
      \ PTSD Therapy \n(Triffleman, 2000) was designed to help cli­\nents of both\

      \ for\nPTSD and substance abuse into a structured,\n40-session (5-month, twice-weekly)\
      \ individual\ntherapy that occurs in two phases. Phase I is \n“Trauma-Informed,\

      \ Regulation: Guide for Educa­\ntion and Therapy (TARGET; Ford & Russo,\n2006;\
      \ Frisman, Ford, Lin, Mallon, & Chang, \n2008) uses emotion and information\
      \ pro­\ncessing in a present-focused, strengths-based\napproach to education\
      \ and skills training for \ntrauma survivors with severe mental, substance \n\
      use, and co-occurring disorders across diverse\npopulations. TARGET helps trauma\
      \ survivors \nunderstand how trauma changes the brain’s \nTARGET: The Seven-Step\
      \ FREEDOM Approach \nFocus: Being focused helps a person pay attention and think\
      \ about what’s happening right now \ninstead of just reacting based on alarm\
      \ signals tied to past trauma. This step teaches participants to \nuse the SOS\
      \ skill (Slow down, Orient, Self-check) to pay attention to body signals and\
      \ the immediate \nenvironment and to use a simple scale to measure stress and\
      \ control levels. \nRecognize triggers: Recognizing trauma triggers enables\
      \ a person to anticipate and reset alarm \nsignals as he or she learns to distinguish\
      \ between a real threat and a reminder. This step helps par­\nticipants identify\
      \ personal triggers, take control, and short-circuit their alarm reactions.\
      \ \nEmotion self-check: The goal of this skill is to identify two types of emotions.\
      \ The first are “alarm” \nor reactive emotions such as terror, rage, shame,\
      \ hopelessness, and guilt. Because these emotions \nare the most noticeable\
      \ after trauma, they are the alarm system’s way of keeping a person primed \n\
      and ready to fend off further danger. The second type of emotion, “main” emotions,\
      \ include posi­\ntive feelings (e.g., happiness, love, comfort, compassion)\
      \ and feelings that represent positive striv­\nings (e.g., hope, interest, confidence).\
      \ By balancing both kinds of emotions, a person can reflect and \ndraw on his\
      \ or her own values and hopes even when the alarm is activated. \nEvaluate thoughts:\
      \ When the brain is in alarm mode, thinking tends to be rigid, global, and cata­\n\
      strophic. Evaluating thoughts, as with identifying emotions, is about achieving\
      \ a healthier balance of \npositive as well as negative thinking. Through a\
      \ two-part process, participants learn to evaluate the \nsituation and their\
      \ options with a focus on how they choose to act—moving from reactive thoughts\
      \ \nto “main” thoughts. This is a fundamental change from the PTSD pattern,\
      \ which causes problems by \ntaking a person straight from alarm signals to\
      \ automatic survival reactions. \nDefine goals: Reactive goals tend to be limited\
      \ to just making it through the immediate situation or \naway from the source\
      \ of danger. These reactive goals are necessary in true emergencies but don’t\
      \ \nreflect a person’s “main” goals of doing worthwhile things and ultimately\
      \ achieving a good and \nmeaningful life. This step teaches one how to create\
      \ “main” goals that reflect his or her deeper \nhopes and values. \nOptions:\
      \ The only options that are available when the brain’s alarm is turned on and\
      \ won’t turn off \nare automatic “flight/fight” or “freeze/submit” reactive\
      \ behaviors that are necessary in emergencies \nbut often unhelpful in ordinary\
      \ living. This step helps identify positive intentions often hidden by the \n\
      more extreme reactive options generated by the alarm system. This opens the\
      \ possibility for a \ngreater range of options that take into consideration\
      \ one’s own needs and goals as well as those of \nothers. \nMake a contribution:\
      \ When the brain’s alarm is turned on and reacting to ordinary stressors as\
      \ if \nthey were emergencies, it is very difficult for a person to come away\
      \ from experiences with a feeling \nthat they have made a positive difference.\
      \ This can lead to feelings of alienation, worthlessness, or \nspiritual distress.\
      \ The ultimate goal of TARGET is to empower adults and young people to think\
      \ \nclearly enough to feel in control of their alarm reactions and, as a result,\
      \ to be able to recognize the \ncontribution they are making not only to their\
      \ own lives, but to others’ lives as well. \nSource: Advanced Trauma Solutions,\

      The trauma recovery and empowerment mod­\nel (TREM) of therapy (Fallot & Harris,\
      \ 2002;\nHarris & Community Connections Trauma\nWork Group, 1998) is a manualized\
      \ group\nintervention designed for female trauma survi­\nvors with severe mental\
      \ disorders. TREM \naddresses the complexity of long-term adapta­\ntion to trauma\
      \ and attends to a range of diffi­\nculties common among survivors of sexual\
      \ and\nphysical abuse. TREM focuses mainly on de­\nveloping specific recovery\
      \ skills and current\nfunctioning and uses techniques that are effec­\ntive\
      \ in trauma recovery services. The model’s \ncontent and structure, which cover\
      \ 33 topics,\nare informed by the role of gender in women’s \nexperience of\
      \ and coping with trauma. \nTREM can be adapted for shorter-term resi­\ndential\
      \ settings and outpatient substance abuse \ntreatment settings, among others.\
      \ Adaptations\nof the model for men and adolescents are \navailable. The model\
      \ was used in SAMHSA’s \nWomen, Co-Occurring Disorders and Vio­\nlence Study\
      \ for three of the nine study sites \nand in SAMHSA’s Homeless Families pro­\n\
      gram, and it is listed in SAMHSA’s NREPP. \nThis model has been used with clients\
      \ in sub­\nstance abuse treatment; research by Toussaint, \nVanDeMark, Bornemann,\
      \ and Graeber \n(2007) shows that women in a residential sub­\nstance abuse\
      \ treatment program showed sig­\nnificantly better trauma treatment outcomes\
      \ \nusing TREM than they did in treatment as \nusual, but no difference in substance\
      \ use. \n152"

      \ \nTriad Women’s Project \nThe Triad Project was developed as a part of\nSAMHSA’s\
      \ Women, Co-Occurring Disorders\nand Violence Study. It is a comprehensive,\n\
      trauma-informed, consumer-responsive inte­\ngrated model designed for female\
      \ trauma sur­\nvivors with co-occurring substance use and\nmental disorders\
      \ who live in semirural areas. \nTriad integrates motivational enhancement for\n\
      substance use disorders, DBT, and intensive\ncase management techniques for\
      \ co-occurring\nmental disorders. This program is a 16-week \ngroup intervention\
      \ for women that uses inte­\ngrated case management services, a\ncurriculum-based\
      \ treatment group, and a peer\nsupport group (Clark & Fearday, 2003). \nEmerging\
      \ Interventions \nNew interventions are emerging to address\ntraumatic stress\
      \ symptoms and disorders. The \nfollowing sections summarize a few interven­\n\
      tions not highlighted in prior chapters; this is\nnot an exhaustive list. In\
      \ addition to specific \ninterventions, technology is beginning to\nshape the\
      \ delivery of care and to increase ac­\ncessibility to tools that complement\
      \ trauma-\nspecific treatments. Numerous applications are \navailable and evolving.\
      \ For more information\non the role of technology in the delivery of\ncare,\
      \ see the planned TIP, Using Technology-\nBased Therapeutic Tools in Behavioral\
      \ Health\nServices (SAMHSA, planned g). \nCouple and Family Therapy \nTrauma\
      \ and traumatic stress affects significant\nrelationships, including the survivor’s\
      \ family.\nAlthough minimal research has targeted the \neffectiveness of family\
      \ therapy with trauma\nsurvivors, it is important to consider the needs \nof\
      \ the individual in the context of their rela­\ntionships. Family and couples\
      \ therapy may be \nkey to recovery. Family members may experi­\nence secondary\
      \ traumatization silently, lack \nunderstanding of traumatic stress symptoms\
      \ or\ntreatment, and/or have their own histories of\ntrauma that influence their\
      \ willingness to sup­\nport the client in the family or to talk about\nanything\
      \ related to trauma and its effects.\nFamily members can engage in similar pat­\n\
      terns of avoidance and have their own triggers \nrelated to the trauma being\
      \ addressed at the \ntime. A range of couple and family therapies \nhave addressed\
      \ traumatic stress and PTSD,\nbut few studies exist that support or refute \n\
      their value. Current couple or family therapies \nthat have some science-based\
      \ evidence include \nbehavioral family therapy, behavioral marital\ntherapy,\
      \ cognitive–behavioral couples treat­\nment, and lifestyle management courses\
      \ \n(Riggs, Monson, Glynn, & Canterino, 2009). \nMindfulness Interventions \n\
      Mindfulness is a process of learning to be pre­\nsent in the moment and observing\
      \ internal \nexperience (e.g., thoughts, bodily sensations)\nand external experience\
      \ (e.g., interactions with \nothers) in a nonjudgmental way. Mindfulness \n\
      challenges limiting beliefs that arise from \ntrauma, quells anxiety about future\
      \ events, and\nsimply helps one stay grounded in the present.\nIt plays a significant\
      \ role in helping individuals\nwho have been traumatized observe their ex­\n\
      periences, increase awareness, and tolerate \nuncomfortable emotions and cognitions.\
      \ \nTo date, mindfulness-based interventions ap­\npear to be valuable as an\
      \ adjunct to trauma-\nspecific interventions and in decreasing arous­\nal (Baer,\
      \ 2003). It may also help individuals \ntolerate discomfort during exposure-oriented\
      \ \nand trauma processing interventions. Overall,\nmindfulness practices can\
      \ help clients in man­\naging traumatic stress, coping, and resilience.\nIn\
      \ a study of firefighters, mindfulness was \nassociated with fewer PTSD symptoms,\
      \ de­\npressive symptoms, physical symptoms, and\nalcohol problems when controlling\
      \ for other\nvariables (Smith et al., 2011). \n153"

      \ Discomfort: The Leaf and \nStream Metaphor \nThe following exercise, “leaves\
      \ floating on a stream,” is a classic. Many clinicians and authors pro­\nvide\
      \ renditions of this mindfulness practice. The main objectives are to stand\
      \ back and observe \nthoughts rather than get caught up in them. Simply stated,\
      \ thoughts are just thoughts. Thoughts \ncome and go like water flowing down\
      \ a stream. We don’t need to react to the thoughts; instead, \nwe can just notice\
      \ them.  \nConduct the mindfulness exercise for about 10 minutes, then process\
      \ afterward. Take time to al­\nlow participants to visualize each sense as they\
      \ imagine themselves sitting next to the stream. For \nexample, what does it\
      \ look like? What do they hear as they sit next to the stream? Don’t rush the\
      \ \nexercise. As you slowly make the statements detailed in the following two\
      \ paragraphs, take time in \nbetween each statement for participants to be in\
      \ the exercise without interruption; simply offer gen­\ntle guidance.   \nBegin\
      \ to sit quietly, bringing your attention to your breath. If you feel comfortable,\
      \ close your eyes. \nAs you focus on breathing in and out, imagine that you\
      \ are sitting next to a stream. In your imagina­\ntion, you may clearly see\
      \ and hear the stream, or you may have difficulty visualizing the stream. Fol­\n\
      low along with the guided exercise; either way, it will work just as well. \n\
      Now begin to notice the thoughts that come into your mind. Some thoughts rush\
      \ by, while others \nlinger. Just allow yourself to notice your thoughts. As\
      \ you begin to notice each thought, imagine \nputting those words onto a leaf\
      \ as it floats by on the stream. Just let the thoughts come, watching \nthem\
      \ drift by on the leaves. If your thoughts briefly stop, continue to watch the\
      \ water flow down the \nstream. Eventually, your thoughts will come again. Just\
      \ let them come, and as they do, place them \nonto a leaf. Your attention may\
      \ wander. Painful feelings may arise. You may feel uncomfortable or \nstart\
      \ to think that the exercise is “stupid.” You may hook onto a thought—rehashing\
      \ it repeatedly. \nThat’s okay; it’s what our minds do. As soon as you notice\
      \ your mind wandering or getting stuck, \njust gently bring your focus back\
      \ to your thoughts, and place them onto the leaves. Now, bring your \nattention\
      \ back to your breath for a moment, then open your eyes and become more aware\
      \ of your \nenvironment.  \nFacilitated Questions: \n•\nWhat was it like for\
      \ you to observe your thoughts? \n• \nDid you get distracted? Stuck?  \n• \n\
      Were you able to bring yourself back to the exercise after getting distracted?\
      \ \n• \nIn what ways was the exercise uncomfortable?  \n• \nIn what ways was\
      \ the exercise comforting? \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \nFor clients and practitioners who want to de­\nvelop a greater capacity\
      \ for mindfulness, see \nKabat-Zinn’s books Wherever You Go, There \nYou Are:\
      \ Mindfulness Meditation In Everyday \nLife (1994) and Full Catastrophe Living:\
      \ Using\nthe Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face\nStress, Pain, and Illness\
      \ (1990). For clinical\napplications of mindfulness, see Mindfulness-\nBased\
      \ Cognitive Therapy for Depression: A New\nApproach to Preventing Relapse (Segal\
      \ et al., \n2002) and Relapse Prevention: Maintenance \nStrategies in the Treatment\
      \ of Addictive Behav­\niors (Marlatt & Donovan, 2005). \nPharmacological Therapy\
      \ \nPharmacotherapy for people with mental, sub­\nstance use, and traumatic\
      \ stress disorders \nneeds to be carefully managed by physicians \nwho are well\
      \ versed in the treatment of each \ncondition. Medications can help manage and\n\
      control symptoms; however, they are only a\npart of a comprehensive treatment\
      \ plan. There \n154\n\n[Page 177]\nPart 1, Chapter 6—Trauma-Specific Services\
      \ \nare no specific “antitrauma” drugs; rather, cer­\ntain drugs target specific\
      \ trauma symptoms.\nClients receiving pharmacotherapy need care­\nful assessment.\
      \ Some clients with preexisting\nmental disorders may need further adjustment\n\
      in medications due to the physiological effects \nof traumatic stress. In addition,\
      \ sudden with­\ndrawal from a pattern of self-administered\nsubstances can not\
      \ only lead to dangerous lev­\nels of physical distress, but also exacerbate\
      \ the\nemergence of more severe PTSD symptoms.\nDistress after trauma often\
      \ lessens over time,\nwhich can sometimes make the use of medica­\ntions unnecessary\
      \ for some individuals. Some \ntrauma survivors do not develop long-term \n\
      psychological problems from their experiences \nthat require medication; others\
      \ may simply \nrefuse the initiation of pharmacotherapy or the\nuse of additional\
      \ medications. \nConcluding Note \nBehavioral health counselors can best serve\
      \ \nclients who have experienced trauma by \nproviding integrated treatment\
      \ that combines \ntherapeutic models to target presenting symp­\ntoms and disorders.\
      \ Doing so acknowledges \nthat the disorders interact with each other. \nSome\
      \ models have integrated curricula; others\nthat address trauma alone can be\
      \ combined \nwith behavioral health techniques with which \nthe counselor is\
      \ already familiar. \nIn part, the choice of a treatment model or\ngeneral approach\
      \ will depend on the level of\nevidence for the model, the counselor’s train­\n\
      ing, identified problems, the potential for pre­\nvention, and the client’s\
      \ goals and readiness\nfor treatment. Are improved relationships with\nfamily\
      \ members a goal? Will the client be \nsatisfied if sleep problems decrease,\
      \ or is the \ngoal resolution of broader issues? Are there \nsubstance use or\
      \ substance-related disorders? \nIs the goal abstinence? Collaborating with\n\
      clients to decide on goals, eliciting what they \nwould like from treatment,\
      \ and determining\nwhat they expect to happen can provide some \nclues as to\
      \ what treatment models or tech­\nniques might be successful in keeping clients\n\
      engaged in recovery. \n155\n\n[Page 179]\n. \n \n \n \nPart 2: An Implementation\

      1 Organizations \nPart 2 provides a broad overview of how to create and implement\n\
      an institutional framework for trauma-informed services in pro­\ngram delivery\
      \ and staff development, policies and procedures, ad­\nministrative practices,\
      \ and organizational infrastructure in\nbehavioral health services. Chapter\
      \ 1, “Trauma-Informed Organi­\nzations,” focuses on specific organizational\
      \ strategies that will help\ndevelop a trauma-informed culture in behavioral\
      \ health settings.\nNumerous strategies are presented, including organizational\
      \ com­\nmitment to trauma-informed care (TIC), trauma-informed organi­\nzational\
      \ assessment, implementation of universal screening for\ntrauma, and creation\
      \ of a peer support environment. \nChapter 2, “Building a Trauma-Informed Workforce,”\
      \ focuses on\norganizational activities that foster the development of a trauma-\n\
      informed workforce, including recruiting, hiring, and retaining\ntrauma-informed\
      \ staff; providing training on evidence-based and \nemerging trauma-informed\
      \ best practices; developing competen­\ncies specific to TIC; addressing ethical\
      \ considerations; providing\ntrauma-informed supervision; and preventing and\
      \ treating second­\nary trauma in behavioral health service providers. \nThe\
      \ strategies described in the following sections can help supervi­\nsors and\
      \ other administrative staff members create a trauma-\ninformed behavioral health\
      \ environment. As a starting point, the\nadministration should identify key\
      \ personnel and consumers to\nguide the organizational change process and the\
      \ organizational as­\nsessment. Administrators and supervisors need to plan\
      \ for and\ndemonstrate an ongoing commitment to these strategies, or staff \n\
      may perceive development activities as comprising yet another idea \nor demand\
      \ from the agency that is short-lived beyond the initial\nthrust of training.\
      \ \n159\n\n[Page 182]\nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \n\
      Creating a trauma-informed organization is a \nfluid, ongoing process; it has\
      \ no completion \ndate. Consumer demographics change across \ntime, exposure\
      \ to specific types of trauma \nmay become more prevalent, and knowledge \n\
      of best and evidence-based practices (EBPs) \nwill continue to advance. A trauma-informed\
      \ \norganization continues to demonstrate a \ncommitment to compassionate and\
      \ effective \npractices and organizational reassessments, \nand it changes to\
      \ meet the needs of consumers \nwith histories of trauma. It is encouraging\
      \ that \nrecent Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration\
      \ (SAMHSA) data \nindicates that the majority of over 10,000 pro­\ngrams they\
      \ surveyed state that they provide \ntrauma-related care (Capezza & Najavits,\
      \ \n2012). However, there remains a major need to \nTIC Framework in Behavioral\
      \ Health Services—Trauma-Informed Organizations \nmake TIC consistently high-quality,\
      \ routine,\nand pervasive across treatment systems. \nThe following stages form\
      \ the basis of creat­\ning a trauma-informed organization:\n1. Commit to creating\
      \ a trauma-informed\nagency. \n2. Create an initial infrastructure to initiate,\n\
      support, and guide changes. \n3. Involve key stakeholders, including con­\n\
      sumers who have histories of trauma. \n4. Assess whether and to what extent\
      \ the\norganization’s current policies, procedures,\nand operations either support\
      \ TIC or in­\nterfere with the development of a trauma-\ninformed approach.\
      \ \n5. Develop an organizational plan to imple­\nment and support the delivery\
      \ of TIC\nwithin the agency. \n160"

      \ \n“A trauma-informed service system and/or organization is one in which all\
      \ components of the system \nhave been reconsidered and evaluated in the light\
      \ of a basic understanding of the role that violence \nand trauma play in the\
      \ lives of people seeking mental health and addiction services. A ‘trauma­\n\
      informed’ organizational environment is capable of supporting and sustaining\
      \ ‘trauma-specific’ ser­\nvices as they develop. A trauma-informed system recognizes\
      \ that trauma results in multiple vulnera­\nbilities and affects many aspects\
      \ of a survivor’s life over the lifespan, and therefore coordinates and \nintegrates\
      \ trauma-related activities and training with other systems of care serving\
      \ trauma survivors. \nA basic understanding of trauma and trauma dynamics…should\
      \ be held by all staff and should be \nused to design systems of services in\
      \ a manner that accommodates the vulnerabilities of trauma sur­\nvivors and\
      \ allows services to be delivered in a way that will avoid retraumatization\
      \ and facilitate con­\nsumer participation in treatment. A trauma-informed service\
      \ system is knowledgeable and \ncompetent to recognize and respond effectively\
      \ to adults and children traumatically impacted by any \nof a range of overwhelming\
      \ adverse experiences, both interpersonal in nature and caused by natural \n\
      events and disasters. There should be written plans and procedures to develop\
      \ a trauma-informed \nservice system and/or trauma-informed organizations and\
      \ facilities with methods to identify and mon­\nitor progress. Training programs\
      \ for this purpose should be implemented.”  \nSource: Jennings, 2009, pp. 111–112.\
      \ \nSeminal Resource for Administrators \nAs you investigate how best to implement\
      \ \nor improve trauma -informed services \nwithin your organization or across\
      \ systems, \nreview the influential work, Using Trauma \nTheory to Design Service\
      \ Systems: New \nDirections for Mental Health Services.  \n(Harris & Fallot,\

      \ between providers\nand consumers and among service provid­\ners and various\
      \ community agencies. \n7.  Put the organizational plan into action. \n8.  Reassess\
      \ the implementation of the plan\nand its ability to meet the needs of con­\n\
      sumers and to provide consistent TIC on \nan ongoing basis. \n9.  Implement\
      \ quality improvement measures \nas needs and problem areas are identified.\n\
      10. Institute practices that support sustainabil­\nity, such as ongoing training,\
      \ clinical su­\npervision, consumer participation and\nfeedback, and resource\
      \ allocation. \nStrategy #1: Show \nOrganizational and \nAdministrative \nCommitment\
      \ to TIC \nForemost, administrators need to understand\nthe impact that trauma\
      \ can have on people’s \nlives. The consistent delivery of TIC is only as \n\
      effective as the organization’s commitment, \nwhich must extend to administrative\
      \ practices \nwith staff members, program policies and pro­\ncedures, program\
      \ design, staffing patterns, use \nof peer support, staff and peer training\
      \ and\nsupervision, organizational assessment and\nconsumer feedback, and resources\
      \ to uphold\ntrauma-informed principles and practices.\nEven short-term change\
      \ is not sustainable\nwithout the agency’s continual commitment. \nTypically,\
      \ desirable organizational change\ndoesn’t occur by accident. It comes from\
      \ \nsteadfast leadership, a convincing message that\nchange is necessary and\
      \ beneficial for staff and\nconsumers, and resources that support change.\n\
      Many people naturally resist change; thus, an\norganization’s commitment includes\
      \ a will­\ningness to discuss with staff members the im­\npact and role of trauma\

      \ Reactions to Implementation of \nNew Processes or Ideas \nA common hurdle\
      \ for administrators after in­\ntroducing a new process or idea is the staff\
      \ \nassumption that it will require more work. \nFrontline staff members are\
      \ often inundated \nwith many responsibilities beyond face-to-face \ntime with\
      \ clients. In addition, a common mis-\nperception is that if you begin to address\
      \ \ntrauma, you will have difficulty containing it.  \nIn addition to administrative\
      \ buy-in, administra­\ntors must promote rather than simply announce \nthe implementation\
      \ of trauma-informed ser­\nvices. Promotion includes educating staff about \n\
      the rationale for trauma-informed services, of­\nfering opportunities for discussion\
      \ and input \nfrom staff and consumers, providing training \nfocused on trauma-informed\
      \ skills, and so forth. \nFor example, the San Diego Trauma-Informed \nGuide\
      \ Team (2012) created a promotional bro­\nchure on how TIC can make staff jobs\
      \ easier: \n•\nFocuses on root problem \n• \nIs preventative \n• \nIncreases\
      \ support system \n• \nFacilitates collaboration \n• \nShares workload \n• \n\
      Empowers client \n• \nProvides consistency in agencies/systems \n• \nUses evidence-based\
      \ best practices \nTIC may be cost-effective, lead to less intensive \nservices\
      \ and less use of services, prevent undue \nstress for staff members and clients,\
      \ and pre­\nvent client crises caused by old policies that \ncould retraumatize\
      \ trauma survivors. \nthe ability to tolerate the uncertainty that nat­\nurally\
      \ accompanies transitions.  \nStrategy #2: Use Trauma-\nInformed Principles\
      \ in \nStrategic Planning \nStrategic planning provides an opportunity to \n\
      explore and develop short- and long-term \ngoals. The planning process often\
      \ begins with \nreevaluating the organizations’ values, mission, \nStatement\
      \ Example \nAs behavioral health service providers, we \nstrive to be trauma\
      \ aware—to understand the \ndynamics and impact of trauma on the lives of \n\
      individuals, families, and communities. We \nstrive to create a trauma-sensitive\
      \ culture by \ndemonstrating, through consumer empower­\nment, program design,\
      \ and direct care, an un­\nderstanding of the relationships among trauma, \n\
      substance abuse, and mental illness. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health\
      \ Services \nand vision, yet agencies cannot adequately \ndevelop a trauma-informed\
      \ strategic plan\nwithout obtaining specific information about\ninternal (staff,\
      \ resources, processes) and exter­\nnal environmental (referral constellation,\n\
      changes in health care, funding sources, State \nand Federal standards, community\
      \ needs, con­\nsumer demographics, etc.) factors and influ­\nences. Data gathered\
      \ through staff, consumer,\norganizational, and community assessments \nshapes\
      \ the direction of the plan, including\nprojected demands, challenges, obstacles,\n\
      strengths, weaknesses, and resources. At the \nconclusion of this planning process,\
      \ the organ­\nization will have specific goals, objectives, and\ntasks to meet\
      \ the needs of their stakeholders \nand to address any anticipated challenges.\
      \ Ide­\nally, strategic planning should define key steps \nin developing or\
      \ refining trauma-informed\nservices within the organization. \nStrategy #3:\
      \ Review and \nUpdate Vision, Mission, \nand Value Statements \nVision, mission,\
      \ and value statements provide\na conceptual framework for TIC development\n\
      and delivery. They should not be created in\nisolation; they should reflect\
      \ voices from the \ncommunity, populations, and other stakehold­\ners that the\
      \ organization serves. These state­\nments develop through input, discussion,\
      \ and\nassessment. They are not static; they evolve as\nneeds, populations,\
      \ or environments change. \n162"

      \ enhanced \nworking environment for employees and consumers that is noncoercive\

      \ \nPrior to the development of an oversight com­\nmittee, a senior staff member\
      \ with the authori­\nty to initiate and implement changes should be \nassigned\
      \ to oversee the developmental process.\nBy assigning a trauma-aware senior\
      \ staff mem­\nber who is committed to trauma-informed \nservices, it is more\
      \ likely that the organiza­\ntion’s and committee’s goals, objectives, and\n\
      plans will remain in focus. This senior staff\nmember is responsible for ongoing\
      \ develop­\nment and facilitation of the oversight commit­\ntee; management\
      \ of the initial organizational\nassessment, reassessments, and other evaluative\n\
      and feedback processes; and facilitation and\noversight of the implementation\
      \ plan and sub­\nsequent changes, including policies and proce­\ndures to ensure\
      \ delivery of TIC. \nStrategy #5: Create a \nTrauma-Informed \nOversight Committee\
      \ \nThe role of the oversight committee includes \nproviding ongoing input and\
      \ direction in the\ninitial organizational assessment, strategic \nplan, plan\
      \ implementation, reevaluation and\ndevelopment of trauma-informed policies\
      \ and \nprocedures, and future reassessments. The \ncommittee monitors progress\
      \ and uses real-\ntime data to forge a clear pathway to new pro­\ncesses that\
      \ support TIC. The committee \nshould involve stakeholders from the commu­\n\
      nity, consumers, specialists, staff members, and\nadministrators. Leadership\
      \ involvement is \nnecessary. Stakeholders may be alumni, family \nmembers,\
      \ community-based organizations,\nand other institutions that interact with\
      \ the \nagency or would benefit from trauma-\ninformed services. \nInitially,\
      \ the agency must educate the commit­\ntee on the organization’s mission, values,\
      \ and\nvision as well as the task at hand—developing\ntrauma-informed services.\
      \ To ease potential \nconflicts or confusion about the organization’s\nstructure,\
      \ the guidelines, expectations, and\nroles of the committee need to be communi­\n\
      cated directly to committee members as well \nas the organization as a whole,\
      \ including board\nmembers, support and professional staff, su­\npervisors,\
      \ and so forth. The committee also\nneeds to know the extent of their power\
      \ and\nthe necessary lines of communication before, \nduring, and after evaluating\
      \ and implementing\nchanges in the organization. \n163"

      \ \n3. Analyze the feedback. \n4. Explore improvement options and the \npotential\
      \ barriers associated with each.  \n5. Select the overall approach and specific\
      \ \nstrategies to address barriers (anticipate \nbarriers, and try to address\
      \ them before \nthey occur). \n6. Develop an implementation plan, and then \n\
      present the plan to staff members and \nother key stakeholders not directly\
      \ in­\nvolved in the quality improvement process. \n7. Implement the plan. \n\
      8. Reassess the new plan. \n9. Evaluate the results and determine if new \n\
      goals or additional problems or issues \nneed to be addressed.  \n10. Repeat\
      \ the first nine steps. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \nIncluding consumers and/or those who have \nlived through trauma is vital.\
      \ They have\nunique knowledge, experiences, and perspec­\ntives on the impact\
      \ of treatment design, deliv­\nery, policies, and procedures. They offer\nfirsthand\
      \ information on practices that can \npotentially retraumatize clients in behavioral\n\
      health settings and can suggest preventive,\nalternative practices and solutions.\
      \ Consumer\ncommittee members keep staff and adminis­\ntrators aware of the\
      \ goal of achieving TIC. \nStrategy #6: Conduct an \nOrganizational Self-\n\
      Assessment of Trauma-\nInformed Services \nAn organizational self-assessment\
      \ evaluates \nthe presence and/or the effectiveness of cur­\nrent trauma-informed\
      \ practices across each\nservice and level of the organization. This \nassessment\
      \ allows an organization to see how \nit functions within the context of trauma-\n\
      informed principles and provides feedback to\ninform the development or revision\
      \ of the \nimplementation plan for TIC. In essence, this \nassessment process\
      \ can serve as a blueprint for\nchange and as a benchmark of compliance \nwith\
      \ and progress in implementing trauma-\ninformed practices across time. Overall,\
      \ it is a \nprocess of identifying organizational strengths,\nweaknesses, opportunities,\
      \ and threats related\nto the implementation and maintenance of\nTIC. Refer\
      \ to Appendix F for sample organi­\nzational assessment tools for the organization\n\
      and the consumer. \nThe self-assessment should obtain feedback \nfrom key stakeholders,\
      \ particularly consumers,\nfamily members, referral sources, community \norganizations,\
      \ and all levels of the organiza­\ntion’s staff, including nonclinical and clinical\n\
      staff, supervisors, and administrative person­\nnel. Similar to the universal\
      \ screening process, \nan organizational self-assessment is only as \neffective\
      \ as the steps taken after data are gath­\nered and analyzed. From this assessment,\
      \ an\nimplementation plan should be established\nthat highlights the goals,\
      \ objectives, steps,\ntimeframe, and personnel responsible in over­\nseeing\
      \ the specific objective. Assessment\nshouldn’t be a once-and-done project.\

      \ Trauma-\nInformed Practices and To \nPrevent Retraumatization \nIn the early\
      \ stage of evaluating current services \nand planning for TIC, the committee\
      \ needs to\nassess practices, procedures, and policies that\nmay have been or\
      \ could be retraumatizing to\nany individual, at any level of the organization,\n\
      from consumers to administrators. Programs \nthat are not trauma informed are\
      \ as likely to\nbe unaware of the impact of trauma on staff as \nthey are to\
      \ be unaware of its influence on con­\nsumers. In the initial review, careful\
      \ scrutiny \nshould be used to eliminate any practice that is \npotentially\
      \ harmful, including seclusion and\nrestraint practices, therapeutic activities\
      \ that\nare shaming, treatment planning without col­\nlaboration, any medical\
      \ inquiry without \nprivacy, and so forth. \nPolicies and procedures are the\
      \ building\nblocks of each agency. They guide the service \nprocess and, if\
      \ followed, they provide an op­\nportunity for the agency to deliver consistent\n\
      responses and care. Policies and procedures \nmust incorporate trauma-informed\
      \ practices\nacross all domains and standards, such as ad­\nmissions, plant/environmental\
      \ standards,\nscreening and assessment processes, referrals \n(to other services,\
      \ including hospitalization, or\nfor further evaluations), treatment planning,\n\
      confidentiality, discharge, and more. They\nalso need to be updated periodically\
      \ to incor­\nporate new science and to meet the changing\nneeds of consumers.\
      \ By regularly reviewing\nand adapting administrative and clinical poli­\ncies\
      \ and procedures in response to ever-\nchanging needs and evidence, the agency\
      \ can\nprovide staff members with good guidelines \nfor providing trauma-informed\
      \ services that\nare consistent yet flexible. \nStrategy #9: Develop a \nDisaster\
      \ Plan \nFacilities are often required to develop disaster\nplans, but specific\
      \ requirements vary from \nState to State. From the outset, developing a\ndisaster\
      \ plan in behavioral health services is \nessential. Many clients in behavioral\
      \ health\nservices have lived with trauma, so proactive\nsteps that reduce the\
      \ impact of a new trauma\nmay prevent worsening of symptoms and de­\ncrease\
      \ the risk for more pervasive effects. (See \nalso Technical Assistance Publication\
      \ 34, Dis­\naster Planning Handbook for Behavioral Health\nTreatment Programs\
      \ [SAMHSA, 2013].) \n166"

      \ \nMost disaster events cannot be accurately an­\nticipated. Even so, behavioral\
      \ health organiza­\ntions can take steps to reduce the impact of a\ndisaster\
      \ event on program functioning and on \nthe lives of clients. Each service or\
      \ program \nshould develop a disaster response committee \nthat meets regularly\
      \ to develop, maintain, and\nadapt policies and procedures to respond to\ndisasters\
      \ affecting the program. Committee \nplanning efforts may include:\n1.  Creating\
      \ a disaster response team of pro­\ngram staff members tasked with coordi­\n\
      nating program administration and\nservices in a disaster event. \n2.  Establishing\
      \ a communication process for\ninforming staff and clients of the status of\n\
      program functioning and for coordinating\nstaff assignments during and shortly\
      \ after\nthe disaster event. \n3.  Outlining a process to inform clients and\n\
      their families of available services, their lo­\ncation, and contact information\
      \ for access­\ning services to meet clients’ critical needs. \n4.  Developing\
      \ plans for service provision\nduring a disaster event and service imple­\n\
      mentation after the event. \n5.  Creating special plans for high-risk or\nspecial\
      \ needs clients who need services \nduring and shortly after the disaster. Ex­\n\
      amples of this are clients who are home­\nless, in detoxification services or\n\
      methadone programs, on prescribed psy­\nchopharmaceuticals, or at risk for suicide.\
      \ \n6.  Making plans for maintaining the security \nof client records, program\
      \ records, and fa­\ncilities during and shortly after the event. \n7.  Coordinating\
      \ ahead with other community\nresources and services to ensure that clients\
      \ \nat high risk or with special needs get the \nservices they require as soon\
      \ as possible. \n8.  Prioritizing how services will start back up\nafter a disaster\
      \ event. \n9.  Providing special services after the event to\nclients at high\
      \ risk for trauma reactions \nand symptoms. \n10. Establishing a postdisaster\
      \ debriefing pro­\ncess to review disaster responses, services,\nand outcomes.\
      \ \nSome specific disaster events, such as hurri­\ncanes, may sometimes offer\
      \ opportunities for\nplanning and preparation in advance of the\ndisaster event.\
      \ This preparation time is usually \njust a few days, but it allows programs\
      \ to make \nadvance preparations and take advance action\nto establish lines\
      \ of communication, stockpile \nresources, prepare for evacuation of clients,\n\
      and protect client and program records. \nStrategy #10: Incorporate \nUniversal\
      \ Routine \nScreenings \nA key element of trauma-informed services is\nthe institution\
      \ of universal routine screening\nacross all services, regardless of the individual’s\
      \ \npath in accessing services (e.g., primary care, \nhospitalization, outpatient).\
      \ Considering the \nprevalence of trauma among individuals who\nseek services\
      \ for mental and substance use \ndisorders, the implementation of screening\
      \ is \nparamount. Without screening, clients are not\nidentified as trauma survivors.\
      \ Subsequently,\nthey miss recovery opportunities and treat­\nment services\
      \ that would be more likely to\nmeet their needs, while also running a higher\n\
      risk of being retraumatized by unexamined\norganizational policies, procedures,\
      \ and prac­\ntices. For more information on the rationale,\nprocesses, and instruments\
      \ of universal screen­\ning for trauma, refer to Part 1, Chapter 4. \nStrategy\
      \ #11: Apply \nCulturally Responsive \nPrinciples \nProviders must be culturally\
      \ competent when\nincorporating evidence-based and best prac­\ntices as well\
      \ as trauma-informed treatment \n167"

      \ Services \nmodels within the organization. Clients’ views \nof behavioral\
      \ health differ according to race,\nethnicity, and culture (refer to the planned\n\
      Treatment Improvement Protocol [TIP], Im­\nproving Cultural Competence [SAMHSA,\n\
      planned c]). Likewise, cultures attach different\nmeanings to trauma, and responses\
      \ to trauma\nwill vary considerable across cultures (see Part\n3, the online\
      \ literature review, for more in­\nformation). For example, trauma survivors\
      \ \nwho come from a collective society or culture,\nin which the goals of the\
      \ group take prece­\ndence over the goals of the individual, may be \nmore focused\
      \ on the well-being of their family\nor the family’s response to the trauma\
      \ survi­\nvors’ experience. Often, this view runs in op­\nposition to the individualistic\
      \ perspective of\nmany behavioral health services. Subsequently, \ntreatment\
      \ providers who are not culturally \ncompetent may interpret collective values\
      \ as a\nsign of resistance or avoidance in dealing with\ntraumatic stress. CMHS\
      \ (2003) outlines prin­\nciples of cultural competence in disaster work \napplicable\
      \ across all forms of trauma:\n1.  Recognize the importance of culture and\n\
      respect diversity. Those who value culture \nand diversity understand their\
      \ own cul­\ntures, attitudes, values, and beliefs, and\nthey work to understand\
      \ the cultures of\nothers. This includes being able to com­\nmunicate effectively\
      \ with those from other\ncultures, respecting others’ feelings about\npersonal\
      \ space, knowing about others’ so­\ncial organization, understanding how time\n\
      is viewed, and being aware of others’ be­\nliefs about the effects of their\
      \ behaviors. \n2.  Maintain a current prof ile of the cultural\ncomposition\
      \ of the community. This in­\ncludes describing the community’s popula­\ntion\
      \ in terms of race and ethnicity, age,\ngender, religion, refugee and immigrant\n\
      status, housing status, income levels, ru­\nral/urban balance, unemployment,\
      \ lan­\nguages spoken, literacy, schools, and\nbusinesses. \n3.  Recruit workers\
      \ who are representative of\nthe community or service area. If the work­\ners\
      \ who are available do not match the \ncommunity, they should have the personal\
      \ \nattributes, knowledge, and skills to develop\ncultural competence. \n4.\
      \  Provide ongoing cultural competence train­\ning to staff. Topics should include\
      \ cultural \nvalues and traditions, family values, lin­\nguistics and literacy,\
      \ immigration experi­\nences and status, help-seeking behaviors, \ntechniques\
      \ and strategies for cross-cultural \noutreach, and the avoidance of stereotypes\
      \ \nand labels (DeWolfe & Nordboe, 2000b). \n5.  Ensure that services are accessible,\
      \ appro­\npriate, and equitable. In planning disaster\nwork or TIC, community\
      \ associations and\norganizations are invaluable. Gaining their\nacceptance\
      \ requires time and energy. \n6.  Recognize the role of help-seeking behav­\n\
      iors, traditions, and natural support net­\nworks. Culture includes traditions\
      \ that \ndictate whom, or which groups, to seek in \ntimes of need; how to handle\
      \ suffering and\nloss; and how healing takes place. These \ncustoms and traditions\
      \ are respected by a\nculturally responsive disaster relief \nprogram. \n7.\
      \  Involve community leaders and organiza­\ntions representing diverse cultural\
      \ groups as\n“cultural brokers.” Collaborating with\ncommunity leaders is an\
      \ effective means of\nlearning about the community, establishing\nprogram credibility,\
      \ and ensuring that ser­\nvices are culturally responsive. \n8. Ensure that\
      \ services and information are \nculturally and linguistically responsive. \n\
      Communication with individuals who do \nnot speak English, who are illiterate\
      \ in all \nlanguages or have limited literacy, and who \nare deaf or hard of\
      \ hearing is essential to \nservice provision. Local radio stations, tel­\n\
      evision outlets, and newspapers that are \nmulticultural are an excellent venue\
      \ for \neducational information after a disaster. \n168"

      \ Organizations \nUsing survivors’ friends or relatives as in­\nterpreters is\
      \ not recommended, as survi­\nvors may b e uncomfortable discussing \npersonal\
      \ matters with family members or \nfriends. Asking children to interpret can\
      \ \nplace too heavy a responsibility on them \nand reverses parents’ and children’s\
      \ roles. \n9. Assess and evaluate the program’s level of \ncultural responsiveness.\
      \ Self-assessment \nand process evaluation can help keep a \nprogram on track.\
      \ A variety of strategies \ncan be used for collecting data and com­\nmunicating\
      \ findings to stakeholders.  \nStrategy #12: Use \nScience-Based Knowledge \n\
      Along with culturally responsive services,\ntrauma-informed organizations must\
      \ use \nscience-based knowledge to guide program \ndevelopment and the implementation\
      \ of ser­\nvices, policies, procedures, and practices.This\nincludes the adoption\
      \ of EBPs (see Part 1,\nChapter 6, and Part 3, Section 1, to review\ndefinition,\
      \ treatments, and resources for EBPs). \nTIC research is quite new; interpret\
      \ these lim­\nited studies and information cautiously.\nChambless and Hollon’s\
      \ (1998) criteria, which \nare still the benchmark for EBPs, are valuable \n\
      resources for administrators. Look closely at\nwho was included—and excluded—from\
      \ \ntreatment studies. Often, the types of severe,\nchronic, and unstable cases\
      \ seen in community \nsettings are excluded from treatment studies.\nEvidence-based\
      \ interventions should be a \nprimary consideration in selecting appropriate\
      \ \ntreatment models for people with mental ill­\nness, substance use disorders,\
      \ and co-occurring\npsychological trauma. Nonetheless, other vari­\nables must\
      \ also be contemplated before adopt­\ning EBPs in an organization, including\
      \ the\ncultural appropriateness of the practice; the\nstrength of its clinical\
      \ focus on strengths-\nbased strategies; training and competence of \nclinical\
      \ staff; the cost of training, materials,\nand implementation; and the ease\
      \ of main­\ntaining EBP fidelity amidst staff turnover. \nStrategy #13: Create\
      \ a \nPeer-Support Environment \nThe main purpose of\npeer support services\
      \ \nis to provide con-\nsumer mentoring,\nsupport, and care \ncoordination for\
      \ cli-\nents with histories of \nmental illness or \nsubstance abuse. The \n\
      goals are to help others deal with personal and\nenvironmental barriers that\
      \ impede recovery \nand achieve wellness. Peer support accom­\nplishes this\
      \ through many activities, including\nadvocacy, support during crises and recovery\
      \ \nactivities, modeling, education, and assistance \nin accessing available\
      \ resources. Peer support\nprograms send a powerful message to staff\nmembers,\
      \ consumers, and the community—\nthat recovery is possible through support,\
      \ col­\nlaboration, and empowerment. These pro­\ngrams reinforce the trauma-informed\
      \ premise \nthat organizations need to reflect the popula­\ntions that they\
      \ serve and involve consumers in\nplanning, implementing, monitoring, and de­\n\

      \ a trauma-based therapeutic approach that has been used in inpatient, resi­\n\
      dential, therapeutic community, and outpatient settings with children, adolescents,\
      \ and adults. It \nprovides a template for changing social service delivery\
      \ systems so that they are better equipped to \nrespond to the complex needs\
      \ of trauma survivors. Sanctuary is informed by four knowledge areas: \n“the\
      \ psychobiology of trauma, the active creation of nonviolent environments, principles\
      \ of social \nlearning, and an understanding of the ways in which complex adaptive\
      \ systems grow, change, and \nalter their course” (Bloom et al., 2003, p. 174).\
      \  \nThe sanctuary model describes a stage-based approach to healing that is\
      \ referred to as SAGE: safety, \naffect modulation, grieving, and emancipation.\
      \ This model is nonlinear; an individual does not neces­\nsarily move from one\
      \ stage to another in a straight path, but progress in one area does affect\
      \ pro­\ngress in other areas (Bloom, 1997; Bloom et al., 2003). SAGE is a cognitive–behavioral\
      \ translation of \nthe sanctuary model (Bills, 2003). Early in treatment, the\
      \ focuses are typically on safety and affect \nmanagement. Safety encompasses\
      \ four domains: physical, psychological, social, and moral (Bloom, \n1997; see\
      \ http://www.sanctuaryweb.com for further details and a curriculum).  \nPart\
      \ 2, Chapter 1—Trauma-Informed Organizations \nmeeting trauma-informed objectives.\
      \ A rou­\ntine monitoring process for TIC implementa­\ntion gives the organization\
      \ additional\ninformation necessary to combat new obsta­\ncles and threats and\
      \ to understand what works. \nRegular monitoring equips organizations with\n\
      the ability to formulate different strategies to\nmeet objectives as well as\
      \ to respond to the\nchanging needs of the population. Ongoing\nevaluation and\
      \ consumer feedback are essen­\ntial in improving the quality of services. \n\
      Strategy #15: Change the \nEnvironment To Increase \nSafety \nPractices that\
      \ generate emotional and physical\nsafety are necessary. Another aspect of creating\n\
      safety is reevaluating the physical facilities and\nenvironment to enhance safety\
      \ and to circum­\nvent preventable retraumatization. Think how\ntraumatizing\
      \ it would be if you were a female \nrape survivor and a night counselor was\
      \ con­\nducting a room check at 2:00 a.m., or a male \nsecurity guard was walking\
      \ the women’s resi­\ndential wing. What would it be like if you \nwere sitting\
      \ with your back to the door in a\nsmall office during an intake interview,\
      \ if your\nhistory included a physical assault and rob­\nbery? For most, it\
      \ would at least increase anxi­\nety; for others it would be retraumatizing.\n\
      Trauma-informed providers must carefully \nassess environmental safety. Although\
      \ you are \nlikely to identify some facility issues that could\nerode safety\
      \ for trauma survivors, a safe envi­\nronment will only be established if regular\n\
      feedback is obtained from consumers about \ntheir experiences with the program.\
      \ \nStrategy #16: Develop \nTrauma-Informed \nCollaborations \nTIC is about\
      \ collaboration with consumers,\nstaff members, key stakeholders, and other\n\
      agencies. Collaborative relationships provide\nopportunities for consumers to\
      \ access the most\nappropriate services as needs arise. Rather\nthan waiting\
      \ for a crisis or a dire need for a\nservice to investigate available resources,\
      \ it is \nfar more efficient and compassionate to estab­\nlish relationships\
      \ within the agency and with \nother community resources before these needs\
      \ \narise. No agency can meet the needs of every \nclient; referral agreements\
      \ and/or collaborative \narrangements that integrate the delivery of\nTIC, including\
      \ support services (e.g., housing,\nlegal, medical), are important. \n171\n\n\

      \ a Trauma­\n2 Informed Workforce  \nIntroduction \nFor an organization to embrace\
      \ a trauma-informed care (TIC)\nmodel fully, it must adopt a trauma-informed\
      \ organizational mis­\nsion and commit resources to support it. This entails\
      \ implementing\nan agency-wide strategy for workforce development that is in\n\
      alignment with the values and principles of TIC and the organiza­\ntion’s mission\
      \ statement. Without a fully trained staff, an organiza­\ntion will not be able\
      \ to implement the TIC model. However,\nsimply training behavioral health professionals\
      \ in TIC is not\nenough. Counselors will not be able to sustain the kind of\
      \ focus \nrequired to adopt and implement a trauma-informed philosophy \nand\
      \ services without the ongoing support of administrators and\nclinical supervisors.\
      \ \nAn organizational environment of care for the health, well-being, \nand\
      \ safety of, as well as respect for, its staff will enhance the ability \nof\
      \ counselors to provide the best possible trauma-informed behav­\nioral health\
      \ services to clients. This culture of care must permeate\nthe organization\
      \ from top to bottom. Behavioral health program \nadministrators should aim\
      \ to strengthen their workforce; doing so\n“requires creating environments that\
      \ support the health and well­\nbeing, not only of persons with mental and substance\
      \ use condi­\ntions, but of the workforce as well” (Hoge, 2007, p. 58). An organi­\n\
      zational culture of care, safety, and respect demands activities that \nfoster\
      \ the development of trauma-informed counselors. This chap­\nter focuses on\
      \ key workforce development activities, such as:\n•\nRecruiting, hiring, and\
      \ retaining trauma-informed staff.\n•\nTraining behavioral health service providers\
      \ on the principles of,\nand evidence-based and emerging best practices relevant\
      \ to, TIC.\n•\nDeveloping and promoting a set of counselor competencies spe­\n\

      \ One of the key findings of this \nreport is that the work environment itself\

      \ hinder the delivery of\nindividualized, respectful, collaborative, and\nclient-centered\
      \ care to service recipients. Fac­\ntors such as the downward pressure on organi­\n\
      zations for higher productivity of counselors \nincrease caseloads and decrease\
      \ wages of be­\nhavioral health staff members and may create \na high-stress\
      \ environment that contributes to\nlow morale and worker dissatisfaction. Other\
      \ \nfactors that often contribute to low retention \nof qualified counselors\
      \ in behavioral health\nsettings include the lack of professional career \n\

      \ is there to do an identified \njob—he is a case manager or a counselor or\

      \ is there to shine the spot­\nlight on trauma issues.”  \nSource: Harris &\

      \ inability to influence the \norganization in which they are working (Hoge\n\

      \ with the co-occurring conditions\nof trauma-related mental and substance use\
      \ \ndisorders and the risk of secondary traumati­\nzation of counselors. In\
      \ creating and sustain­\ning a trauma-informed workforce,\norganizations need\
      \ to foster a work environ­\nment that parallels the treatment philosophy\n\
      of a trauma-informed system of care. Doing\nso allows counselors to count on\
      \ a work envi­\nronment that values safety, endorses collabora­\ntion in the\
      \ making of decisions at all levels,\nand promotes counselor well-being. \n\
      Recruitment and Hiring in a \nTrauma-Informed System of Care \nIn a 2007 technical\
      \ report ( Jennings, 2007b), \nthe National Center for Trauma-Informed \nCare\
      \ identified several priorities for organiza­\ntions with regard to recruitment\
      \ and hiring\ntrauma-informed staff, including:\n•  Active recruitment of and\
      \ outreach to pro­\nspective employees who are trauma-\ninformed or have formal\
      \ education in \nproviding trauma-informed or trauma-\nspecific services in\
      \ settings such as universi­\nties, professional organizations, professional\
      \ \ntraining and conference sites, peer support\ngroups, and consumer advocacy\
      \ groups. \n•  Hiring counselors and peer support staff\nmembers with educational\
      \ backgrounds \nand training in trauma-informed and/or \ntrauma-specific services\
      \ and/or lived expe­\nrience of trauma and recovery. \n•  Providing incentives,\
      \ bonuses, and promo­\ntions for staff members during recruitment\nand hiring\
      \ that take into consideration\nprospective employees’ trauma-related ed­\n\
      ucation, training, and job responsibilities. \nIn addition to hiring behavioral\
      \ health profes­\nsionals with formal professional education and\ntraining,\
      \ organizations should also “routinely \nsurvey the demographics and other character­\n\
      istics of the population served and recruit a\nworkforce of similar composition”\
      \ (Hoge et\nal., 2007, p. 297). Essentially, this means ac­\ntively engaging\
      \ in outreach to consumer advo­\ncacy groups, recovery-oriented programs, \n\
      community and faith-based organizations, and\nformer clients/consumers with\
      \ the intention of\nrecruiting potential employees whose \nknowledge and expertise\
      \ comes from their\nlived experience of trauma, resilience, and\nrecovery. Support\
      \ staff members, peer support\nworkers, counselors in training, and appren­\n\
      tices can be recruited from this population and\noffered incentives, such as\
      \ tuition reimburse­\nment, training stipends, and professional \nmentoring\
      \ with the goal of developing a trau­\nma-informed workforce from within the\
      \ de­\nmographic served. Jennings (2007b) calls these \nstaff members “trauma\
      \ champions” who can \nprovide needed expertise in a trauma-\ninformed organization\
      \ to promote trauma-\ninformed policies, staff development, and\ntrauma-based\
      \ services consistent with the mis­\nsion of the organization (p. 135). \n175"

      \ and Increasing Workforce \nRetention \nTo prevent behavioral health staff\
      \ turnover and increase retention of qualified, satisfied, and highly \ncommitted\
      \ trauma-informed counselors, consider: \n•\nOffering competitive wages, benefits,\
      \ and performance incentives that take into account educa­\ntion, training,\
      \ and levels of responsibility in providing trauma-informed or trauma-specific\
      \ services. \n• \nCreating a safe working environment that includes both the\
      \ physical plant and policies and pro­\ncedures to prevent harassment, stalking,\
      \ and/or violence in the workplace and to promote re­\nspectful interactions\
      \ amongst staff at all levels of the organization. \n• \nEstablishing an organizational\
      \ policy that normalizes secondary trauma as an accepted part of \nworking in\
      \ behavioral health settings and views the problem as systemic—not the result\
      \ of indi­\nvidual pathology or a deficit on the part of the counselor. \n•\
      \ \nInstituting reasonable, manageable caseloads that mix clients with and without\
      \ trauma-related \nconcerns. \n• \nLetting staff offer input into clinical and\
      \ administrative policies that directly affect their work ex­\nperience. \n\
      • \nProviding vacation, health insurance (which includes coverage for psychotherapy/personal\
      \ coun­\nseling), and other benefits that promote the well-being of the staff.\
      \ \n• \nImplementing regular, consistent clinical supervision for all clinical\
      \ staff members. \n• \nProviding ongoing training in trauma-informed services\
      \ offered by the organization. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \nAs with hiring behavioral health professionals \nwho are in recovery from\
      \ substance use disor­\nders, the organization should be transparent\nand explicit\
      \ in its recruitment and hiring prac­\ntices of trauma survivors in recovery.\
      \ The or­\nganization can be transparent by advertising\nthe mission statement\
      \ of the organization as \npart of the recruitment process and inviting\napplicants\
      \ who are in recovery from trauma to\napply. The needs of behavioral health\
      \ staff\nmembers who are in recovery from both sub­\nstance use and trauma-related\
      \ conditions and \nworking in a trauma-informed system of care \nshould be addressed\
      \ in the organization’s on­\ngoing training, clinical supervision, and staff\n\
      development policies and practices. \nWorkforce Retention \nStaff turnover is\
      \ rampant in behavioral health\nsettings. It is costly to the organization,\
      \ and as \na result, it is costly to clients. A strong thera­\npeutic relationship\
      \ with a counselor is one of\nthe largest factors in an individual’s ability\
      \ to\nrecover from the overwhelming effects of\ntrauma. When behavioral health\
      \ professionals \nleave an organization prematurely or in crisis \nas a result\
      \ of chronic levels of high stress or\nsecondary traumatization, clients must\

      \ Workforce \nbehavioral health staff members are interested \nin the same kind\
      \ of work environment and \nbenefits as employees in many other fields.\nThey\
      \ include a “living wage with healthcare\nbenefits; opportunities to grow and\
      \ advance;\nclarity in a job role; some autonomy and input\ninto decisions;\
      \ manageable workloads; admin­\nistrative support without crushing administra­\n\

      \ a decent and safe \nphysical work environment; a competent and\ncohesive team\
      \ of coworkers; the support of a\nsupervisor; and rewards for exceptional per­\n\
      formance” (Hoge et al., 2007, p. 18). \nWhen an organization’s administration\
      \ values \nits staff by providing competitive salaries and\nbenefits, a safe\
      \ working environment, a rea­\nsonable and manageable workload, input into\n\
      the making of clinical and administrative poli­\ncy decisions, and performance\
      \ incentives, it\nhelps behavioral health workers feel connected\nto the mission\
      \ of the organization and become\ndedicated to its sustainability and growth.\n\
      This type of work environment demonstrates \nboth a level of respect for counselors\
      \ (similar\nto the level of respect a trauma-informed or­\nganization displays\
      \ toward clients) and an \nappreciation for the complexity of their job\nresponsibilities\
      \ and the stress they face when\nworking with people who have experienced\n\
      trauma in their lives. To retain behavioral \nhealth professionals working in\
      \ a trauma-\ninformed setting, wages and performance in­\ncentives should be\
      \ tied not only to education,\ntraining, and work experience, but also to lev­\n\
      els of responsibility in working with clients \nwho have experienced trauma.\
      \ \nTraining in TIC \nTraining for all staff members is essential in\ncreating\
      \ a trauma-informed organization. It \nmay seem that training should simply\
      \ focus on\nnew counselors or on enhancing the skill level \nof those who have\
      \ no prior experience in\nworking with trauma, but training should, in\nfact,\
      \ be more systematic across the organiza­\ntion to develop fully sustainable\
      \ trauma-\ninformed services. All employees, including\nadministrative staff\
      \ members, should receive \nan orientation and basic education about the \n\
      prevalence of trauma and its impact on the\norganization’s clients. To ensure\
      \ safety and\nreduction of harm, training should cover dy­\nnamics of retraumatization\
      \ and how practice\ncan mimic original sexual and physical abuse\nexperiences,\
      \ trigger trauma responses, and\ncause further harm to the person. Training\
      \ for \nall employees must also educate them “about\nthe impacts of culture,\
      \ race, ethnicity, gender,\nage, sexual orientation, disability, and socio­\n\
      economic status on individuals’ experiences of \ntrauma” (Jennings, 2007a, p.\
      \ 5). \nAll clinical and direct service staff members, \nregardless of level\
      \ of experience, should receive \nmore indepth training in screening and as­\n\
      sessment of substance use and trauma-related \ndisorders; the relationships\
      \ among trauma, \nsubstance use disorders, and mental disorders;\nhow to understand\
      \ difficult client behaviors \nthrough a trauma-informed lens; how to avoid\n\
      retraumatizing clients in a clinical setting; the\ndevelopment of personal and\
      \ professional \nboundaries unique to clinical work with trau­\nmatized clients;\
      \ how to identify the signs of\nsecondary traumatization in themselves; and\n\
      how to develop a comprehensive personal and\nprofessional self-care plan to\
      \ prevent and/or\nameliorate the effects of secondary traumati­\nzation in the\
      \ workplace. All clinical staff\nmembers who work with traumatized clients \n\
      should receive additional training in evidence-\nbased and promising practices\
      \ for the treat­\nment of trauma (for information on locating\ntraining, see\
      \ Appendix B.) This might include \ntraining done within the agency by experts\
      \ in\nthe field or training received by attending ad­\nvanced trauma trainings.\

      \ clinical social worker who \njust finished his master’s program in social\
      \ \nwork and is working in a trauma-informed out­\npatient program for people\
      \ with substance use \ndisorders. He is recovering from alcohol use \ndisorder\
      \ and previously worked in a residential \nrehabilitation program as a recovery\
      \ support \ncounselor. There, his primary responsibilities \nwere to take residents\
      \ to Alcoholics Anony­\nmous (AA) meetings, monitor their participa­\ntion,\
      \ and confront them about their substance \nuse issues and noncompliance with\
      \ the pro­\ngram’s requirement of attendance a t 12-Step \nmeetings. \nIn Larry’s\
      \ new position as a counselor, he con­\nfronts a client in his group regarding\
      \ her dis­\ncomfort with attending AA meetings. The \nclient reports that she\
      \ feels uncomfortable with \nthe idea that she has to admit that she is pow­\n\
      erless over alcohol to be accepted by the \ngroup of mostly men. She was sexually\
      \ abused \nby her stepfather when she was a child and \nbegan drinking heavily\
      \ and smoking pot when \nshe was 11 years old. The client reacts angrily \n\
      to Larry’s intervention. \nIn supervision, Larry discusses his concerns \nregarding\
      \ the client’s resistance to AA and the \nfeedback that he provided to her in\
      \ group. \nBeyond focusing supervision on Larry’s new \nrole as a counselor\
      \ in a trauma-informed pro­\ngram, the clinical supervisor recommends that \n\
      Larry take an interactive, multisession, comput­\ner-assisted training on the\
      \ 12-Step facilitation \n(TSF) model. The TSF model introduces clients \nto\
      \ and assists them with engaging in 12-Step \nrecovery support groups. The agency\
      \ has the \ncomputer-based training available in the office, \nand Larry agrees\
      \ to use follow-up coaching \nsessions with his supervisor to work on imple­\n\
      mentation of the approach. The supervisor \nrecognizes that Larry is falling\
      \ back on his own \nrecovery experience and the strategies he re­\nlied on in\
      \ his previous counseling role. He will \nbenefit from further training and\
      \ coaching in an \nevidence-based practice that provides a non-\naggressive,\
      \ focused, and structured way to \nfacilitate participation in recovery support\
      \ \ngroups with clients who have trauma histories. \nTrauma-Informed Care in\
      \ Behavioral Health Services \nshould provide the time and financial re­\nsources\
      \ to clinical staff members for this pro­\nfessional development activity. Jennings\n\
      (2007a) suggests that, whenever possible,\n“trainings should be multi-system,\
      \ inclusive of\nstaff in mental health and substance abuse,\nhealth care, educational,\
      \ criminal justice, social\nservices systems and agencies, and promoting\nsystems\
      \ integration and coordination” (p. 5). \nMoreover, criminal justice settings,\
      \ schools,\nmilitary/veteran programs, and other places in\nwhich behavioral\
      \ health services are provided\nmay benefit from approaches that are sensitive\
      \ \nto the special circumstances and cultures of\nthese environments. For example,\
      \ in exploring\ntrauma-informed correctional care, Miller and \nNajavits (2012,\
      \ p. 1) observe: \nPrisons are challenging settings for trauma-\ninformed care.\
      \ Prisons are designed to house\nperpetrators, not victims. Inmates arrive shack­\n\
      led and are crammed into overcrowded hous­\ning units; lights are on all night,\
      \ loud speakers\nblare without warning and privacy is severely \nlimited. Security\
      \ staff is focused on maintain­\ning order and must assume each inmate is po­\n\
      tentially violent. The correctional environment\nis full of unavoidable triggers,\
      \ such as pat \ndowns and strip searches, frequent discipline\nfrom authority\
      \ figures, and restricted move-\nment….This is likely to increase trauma-\n\
      related behaviors and symptoms that can be \ndifficult for prison staff to manage….Yet,\
      \ if\ntrauma-informed principles are introduced, all\nstaff can play a major\
      \ role in minimizing trig­\ngers, stabilizing offenders, reducing critical in­\n\
      cidents, deescalating situations, and avoiding\nrestraint, seclusion or other\
      \ measures that may\nrepeat aspects of past abuse. \nThe Need for Training \n\
      Behavioral health service providers working\nwith clients who have mental, substance\
      \ use,\nand trauma-related disorders need to have the \nbest knowledge, skills,\
      \ and abilities. Substance\nabuse counselors, in particular, require addition­\n\
      al training and skill development to be able to\nextend trauma-informed services\

      \ to Counselor Training in Trauma-\nInformed Treatment Settings \n•\nSome substance\
      \ abuse counseling strategies commonly used to work through clients’ denial\
      \ and \nminimization of their substance use issues may be inappropriate when\
      \ working with trauma sur­\nvivors (e.g., highly confrontational models can\
      \ remind trauma survivors of emotional abuse). \nTraining: The Stages of Change\
      \ model of addiction treatment can help counselors shift from \nthe traditional\
      \ confrontation of denial to conceptualizing clients’ ambivalence about changing\
      \ \nsubstance use patterns as a normal part of the precontemplation stage of\
      \ change. This method \nis a respectful cognitive–behavioral approach that helps\
      \ counselors match counseling strategies \nto their assessment of where each\
      \ client is in each stage of change, with the ultimate goal of \nhelping clients\
      \ make changes to health risk behaviors. (Connors, Donovan, & DiClemente, 2001).\
      \ \n• \nThe 12-Step concept of powerlessness (Step 1) may seem unhelpful to\
      \ trauma survivors for \nwhom the emotional reaction to powerlessness is a major\
      \ part of their trauma (particularly for \nvictims of repetitive trauma, such\
      \ as child abuse or intimate partner violence). It can be confus­\ning and counterproductive\
      \ to dwell on this concept of powerlessness regarding trauma when \nthe therapeutic\
      \ objective for trauma-informed counseling methods should be to help clients\
      \ \nempower themselves. For people in recovery, powerlessness is a paradox,\
      \ sometimes misunder­\nstood by both counselors and clients, in that the acknowledgment\
      \ of powerlessness often cre­\nates a sense of empowerment. Most clients, with\
      \ support and respectful guidance from a \ncounselor, will come to understand\
      \ that powerlessness (as used in 12-Step programs) is not an \ninability to\
      \ stand up for oneself or express a need, and it does not mean for one to be\
      \ powerless \nin the face of abuse. With this understanding, clients may become\
      \ more open to participating in \n12-Step groups as a resource for their recovery\
      \ from substance use disorders. When clients con­\ntinue to struggle with this\
      \ concept and decline to participate in 12-Step recovery efforts, they \nmay\
      \ benefit from referral to other forms of mutual-help programs or recovery support\
      \ groups in \nwhich the concept of powerlessness over the substance of abuse\
      \ is not such a significant issue.  \nTraining: The TSF model can help counselors\
      \ develop a more supportive and understanding \napproach to facilitating clients’\
      \ involvement in 12-Step recovery groups (if this is a client-\ngenerated recovery\
      \ goal). “Although based on standard counseling models, TSF differs from \n\
      them in several ways. These differences include TSF’s strong emphasis on therapist\
      \ support, dis­\ncouragement of aggressive ‘confrontation of denial’ and therapist\
      \ self-disclosure, and highly fo­\ncused and structured format” (Sholomskas\
      \ & Carroll, 2006, p. 939). \nAnother well-intentioned, but often misguided,\
      \ approach by counselors who have not had for­\nmal or extensive training is\
      \ “digging” for trauma memories without a clear therapeutic rationale \nor understanding\
      \ of client readiness. In doing so, the counselor may unintentionally retraumatize\
      \ \nthe client or produce other harmful effects. In early intervention, it is\
      \ sufficient simply to \nacknowledge and validate the pain and suffering of\
      \ the client without uncovering or exploring \nspecific trauma memories. The\
      \ counselor who is insufficiently trained in trauma-informed clinical  \n(Continued\

      \ who have co-occurring\nsubstance use, trauma-related, or mental disor­\nders.\
      \ Many clinical practice issues in traditional\nsubstance abuse treatment are\
      \ inconsistent with \ntrauma-informed practice, which needs to be \naddressed\
      \ with further training. Similarly, men­\ntal health clinicians often need training\
      \ in\nsubstance abuse treatment, as they typically do \nnot have backgrounds\
      \ or experience in that\ndomain. Moreover, several surveys indicate \nthat clinicians\
      \ consistently perceive the com­\nbination of trauma and substance abuse as\
      \ \nharder to treat than either one alone (Najavits,\nNorman, Kivlahan, & Kosten,\
      \ 2010). It is thus\nkey to emphasize cross-training as part of\nTIC. Exhibit\
      \ 2.2-1 addresses these issues and \noffers suggestions for additional training.\

      \ and disadvantages of ex­\nploring trauma-related concerns, and then, following\

      \ and medication compliance (Arkowitz, Miller, Westra, & Rollnick, \n2008; Kress\

      \ and experiential learning activities over purely didactic training. \n• \n\
      Provide ongoing mentoring/coaching to behavioral health professionals in addition\
      \ to regular \nclinical supervision to enhance compliance with the principles\
      \ and practices of TIC and to foster \ncounselor mastery of trauma-specific\
      \ practice models. \n• \nBuild organization-wide support for the ongoing integration\
      \ of new attitudes and counselor skills \nto sustain constructive, TIC-consistent\
      \ changes in practice patterns. \n• \nProvide adequate and ongoing training\
      \ for clinical supervisors in the theory and practice of clini­\ncal supervision\
      \ and the principles and practices of TIC. \n• \nInclude information and interactive\
      \ exercises on how counselors can identify, prevent, and ame­\nliorate secondary\
      \ traumatic stress (STS) reactions in staff trainings.  \n• \nOffer cross-training\
      \ opportunities to enhance knowledge of trauma-informed processes through­\n\
      out the system. \nPart 2, Chapter 2—Building a Trauma-Informed Workforce \n\
      demonstrates that immediate gains in counse­\nlor knowledge and skills diminish\
      \ quickly after\nthe training event (Martino, Canning-Ball, \nCarroll, & Rounsaville,\
      \ 2011). Consequently,\norganizations may be spending their scarce \nfinancial\
      \ resources on sending counselors to\nthis kind of training but may not be reaping\n\
      adequate returns with regard to long-lasting\nchanges in counselor skills and\
      \ the develop­\nment of trauma-informed and trauma-specific \ncounselor competencies.\
      \ Hoge et al. (2007)\nsuggest the implementation of training strate­\ngies for\
      \ behavioral health professionals that \nhave proven to be effective in improving\
      \ coun­\nselor skills, attitudes, and practice approaches. \nThese strategies\
      \ include: “interactive ap­\nproaches; sequenced, longitudinal learning\nexperiences;\
      \ outreach visits, known as academ­\nic detailing; auditing of practice with\
      \ feedback\nto the learner; reminders; the use of opinion\nleaders to influence\
      \ practice; and patient-\nmediated interventions, such as providing in­\nformation\
      \ on treatment options to persons in\nrecovery, which in turn influences the\
      \ practice \npatterns of their providers” (p. 124). \nTrauma-Informed \nCounselor\
      \ Competencies \nHoge et al. (2007) identified a number of\ncounselor competencies\
      \ in behavioral health\npractices that are consistent with the skills \nneeded\
      \ to be effective in a trauma-informed \nsystem of care. They include person-centered\
      \ \nplanning, culturally competent care,\ndevelopment of therapeutic alliances,\
      \ shared\nresponsibility for decisions, collaboratively \ndeveloped recovery\
      \ plans, evidence-based\npractices, recovery- and resilience-oriented \ncare,\
      \ interdisciplinary- and team-based\npractice, and consumer/client advocacy.\
      \ In\naddition, counselor competencies critical to\nthe effective delivery of\
      \ services to clients with\ntrauma-related disorders include: \n•  Screening\
      \ for and assessment of trauma\nhistory and trauma-related disorders, such\n\
      as mood and anxiety disorders. \n•  Awareness of differences between trauma-\n\
      informed and trauma-specific services. \n181"

      \ this checklist to\nassess behavioral health professionals’ under­\nstanding\
      \ of trauma awareness and counseling\nskills and determine the need for additional\
      \ \ntraining and clinical supervision. \nCounselor Responsibilities \nand Ethics\
      \ \nTreating all clients in an ethical manner is an\nexpectation of all healthcare\
      \ providers. It is of\nspecial importance when working with clients \nwho have\
      \ trauma-related disorders, as their\ntrust in others may have been severely\
      \ shaken.\nCounselors who work with traumatized indi­\nviduals on a regular\
      \ basis have special respon­\nsibilities to their clients because of the nature\
      \ \nof this work. Administrators and clinical su­\npervisors in trauma-informed\
      \ organizations\nshould develop policies that clearly define the \ncounselors’\
      \ job and should provide education\nabout the role of counselors in the organiza­\n\
      tion and their responsibilities to clients. \nGeneral Principles Regarding \n\
      Counselor Responsibilities \nThe following are some general principles \ngoverning\
      \ the responsibilities of counselors \nwho provide behavioral health services\
      \ for\nclients with histories of trauma: \n•  Counselors are responsible for\
      \ routinely \nscreening clients for traumatic experiences \nand trauma-related\
      \ symptoms (Ouimette \n& Brown, 2003; see also Treatment Im­\nprovement Protocol\
      \ [TIP] 42, Substance \nAbuse Treatment for Persons With Co-\nOccurring Disorders,\
      \ Center for Substance\nAbuse Treatment [CSAT], 2005c). \n•  Counselors should\
      \ offer clients with sub­\nstance use and trauma-related disorders \ncontinuing\
      \ mental health services if it is\nwithin their professional license and scope\
      \ \nof practice to do so. \n•  Counselors are responsible for referring\nclients\
      \ with substance use disorders and co-\noccurring trauma-related disorders to\n\
      treatment that addresses both disorders \nwhen the treatment falls outside of\
      \ the \ncounselor’s professional license and scope of\npractice (Ouimette &\
      \ Brown, 2003). \n•  Counselors should refer clients with sub­\nstance use disorders\
      \ and co-occurring\ntrauma-related disorders to concurrent par­\nticipation\
      \ in mutual-help groups if appro­\npriate (Ouimette & Brown, 2003). \n•  Counselors\
      \ have a responsibility to practice \nthe principles of confidentiality in all\
      \ inter­\nactions with clients and to respect clients’ \nwishes not to give\
      \ up their right to privi­\nleged communication. \n•  Counselors are responsible\
      \ for educating\nclients about the limits of confidentiality \nand what happens\
      \ to protected health in­\nformation, along with the client’s privilege,\nwhen\
      \ the client signs a release of infor­\nmation or agrees to assign insurance\
      \ bene­\nfits to the provider. \n•  Counselors must inform clients that treat­\n\
      ment for trauma-related disorders is always\nvoluntary. \n•  Counselors are\
      \ responsible for being aware \nof their own secondary trauma and \n182"

      \ abuse counseling, psychiatry,\nsocial work, psychology, professional counsel­\n\

      \ for ethical prac­\ntice in these professions. These boards also\nhave specific\
      \ procedures for responding to\ncomplaints regarding the actions of profes­\n\
      sional caregivers. Additionally, national profes­\nsional societies have standards\
      \ for ethical \npractices. Members of these organizations are \nexpected to\
      \ practice within the boundaries and\nscope of these standards. Some of these\
      \ stand­\nards are quite explicit, whereas others are more \ngeneral; most approach\
      \ professional ethics not\nas a rigid set of rules, but rather, as a process\
      \ \nof making ethical decisions. \nClinical supervisors are responsible for\
      \ in­\nforming counselors of their ethical responsi­\nbilities with regard to\
      \ their own organization’s \npolicies and procedures, monitoring supervi­\n\
      sees’ reading and understanding the codes of\nethics of professional organizations\

      \ and revise clinical policies \nin line with State and Federal law and profes­\n\

      \ Boundary Confusion \nClinical supervisors should be aware of the following\
      \ counselor behaviors that can indicate boundary \nconfusion with clients: \n\
      •\nThe counselor feels reluctant or embarrassed to discuss specific interactions\
      \ with a client or de­\ntails of the client’s treatment in supervision or team\
      \ meetings. \n• \nThe counselor feels possessive of the client, advocates with\
      \ unusual and excessive vehemence for \nthe client, or expresses an unreasonable\
      \ sense of overresponsibility for the client. \n• \nThe counselor becomes defensive\
      \ and closed to hearing ideas from the supervisor or the treat­\nment team members\
      \ about approaches to working with a client and/or exploring his or her own\
      \ \nemotional reactions to a client. \n• \nThe clinician begins or increases\
      \ personal self-disclosure to the client and is not able to identify \nlegitimate\
      \ clinical reasons for the self-disclosure. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral\
      \ Health Services \nin establishing appropriate boundaries in the\ncounseling\
      \ setting; they may be particularly \nvulnerable and not understand or appreciate\
      \ \nthe need for professional boundaries, includ­\ning not engaging in dual\
      \ relationships. For\nexample, some clients might experience a\ncounselor’s\
      \ boundary around not giving the \nclient his or her personal phone number for\n\
      emergency calls as a rejection or abandon­\nment. Cultural considerations also\
      \ influence \ntherapeutic boundaries. \nAdministrators, in collaboration with\
      \ clinical\nsupervisors, are responsible for creating poli­\ncies regarding\
      \ counselor and client boundaries\nfor various issues (e.g., giving and receiving\n\
      gifts, counselor personal disclosure, and coun­\nselor roles and responsibilities\
      \ when attending\nthe same 12-Step meetings as clients); policies\nshould be\
      \ specific to their organization and\nconform to State and Federal law and behav­\n\
      ioral health professional codes of ethics. Clini­\ncal supervisors are responsible\
      \ for training\ncounselors in the informed consent process \nand effective ways\
      \ to discuss boundaries with\nclients when they enter treatment. \nGuidelines\
      \ for establishing and maintaining\nboundaries in therapeutic relationships,\n\
      adapted from the Green Cross Academy of\nTraumatology, are given in Exhibit\
      \ 2.2-6. \nClients with trauma histories may be especial­\nly vulnerable to\
      \ counselor behaviors that are \ninconsistent or that are experienced by the\
      \ \nclient as boundary violations. Examples of\nsuch behavior include: being\
      \ late for appoint­\nments, ending counseling sessions early, re­\npeatedly\
      \ and excessively extending the session\ntime, canceling or “forgetting” appointments\
      \ \nmultiple times, spending time in the session\ntalking about their own needs\
      \ and life experi­\nences, exploring opportunities for contact out­\nside the\
      \ therapeutic relationship (including\nmaking arrangements to meet at AA or\
      \ other\n12-Step recovery group meetings), and enforc­\ning rules differently\
      \ for one client than for\nanother. \nDue to the complex dynamics that can arise\
      \ in\nthe treatment of clients with trauma histories,\nregularly scheduled clinical\
      \ supervision, where \nissues of ethics and boundaries can be dis­\ncussed,\
      \ is recommended for counselors. For\nmore information on how clinical supervision\n\
      can be effectively used, see TIP 52, Clinical \nSupervision and the Professional\
      \ Development of \nthe Substance Abuse Counselor (CSAT, 2009b). \nBoundary crossing\

      \ tools in helping clinical supervisors and\ncounselors understand the boundaries\

      \ context-bound. Given these \nlimitations, it is crucial to educate counselors\

      \ client can only \noccur within the boundaries of the professional relationship.\
      \ This information is part of the informed \nconsent process. Relationships\

      \ clients.  \n• \nDo not reward sexualized behaviors with attention or reactivity.\
      \  \n• \nDirectly clarify the boundaries of the therapeutic relationship, and\
      \ address the underlying moti­\nvations of persisting sexualized behavior. \
      \ \n• \nSet limits on a client’s inappropriate behaviors while maintaining an\
      \ ethos of care. Maintain re­\nspect for the dignity and worth of the client\
      \ at all times.  \n• \nUnderstand that a client’s attempt to sexualize a therapeutic\
      \ relationship may reflect an early \nhistory of abuse, difficulty understanding\
      \ social norms, or a variety of psychological problems.  \n• \nReaddress the\
      \ absolute inappropriateness of sexual and/or romantic behavior in a nonlecturing,\
      \ \nnonpunitive manner.  \n• \nIf sexual behavior between clients occurs in\
      \ a treatment program, counselors should consult with \na clinical supervisor.\
      \ Document the nature of the contact and how the issue is addressed. \n• \n\
      If a counselor has sexual contact with a client, he or she should take responsibility\
      \ by ceasing \ncounseling practice, referring clients to other treatment providers,\
      \ and notifying legal and pro­\nfessional authorities. If a counselor is at\

      \ licensed professional counselor working in an inpatient eating disorder pro­\n\
      gram. She has had extensive training in trauma and eating disorder counseling\
      \ approaches and has \nbeen working as a clinician in mental health settings\
      \ for 15 years. Denise is usually open to sugges­\ntions from her supervisor\
      \ and other treatment team members about specific strategies to use w\n ith\
      \ \nclients who have trauma histories and eating disorders. However, in the\
      \ past week, her supervisor has \nnoticed that she has become defensive in team\
      \ meetings and individual supervision when discussing \na recently admitted\
      \ young adult who was beaten and raped by her boyfriend; subsequently, the cli­\n\
      ent was diagnosed with PTSD and anorexia. When the clinical supervisor makes\
      \ note of the change in \nDenise’s attitude and behavior in team meetings since\
      \ this young woman was admitted, initially \nDenise becomes defensive, saying\
      \ that the team just doesn’t understand this young woman and that \nthe client\
      \ has repeatedly told Denise, “You’re the only counselor I trust.”  \nThe clinical\
      \ supervisor recognizes that Denise may be experiencing secondary traumatization\
      \ and \nboundary confusion due to working with this young woman and to the recent\
      \ increase in the number \nof clients with co-occurring trauma-related disorders\
      \ on her caseload. After further exploration, \nDenise reveals that her own\
      \ daughter was raped at the same age as the young woman and that hear­\ning\
      \ her story has activated an STS reaction in Denise. Her way of coping has been\
      \ to become overly \nresponsible for and overprotective of the young woman.\
      \ With the nonjudgmental support of her \nsupervisor, Denise is able to gain\
      \ perspective, recognize that this young woman is not her daughter, \nand reestablish\
      \ boundaries with her that are appropriate to the inpatient treatment setting.\
      \ \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \ncounselors the distinction\
      \ between boundary \ncrossings and boundary violations in clinical\npractice.\
      \ Gutheil and Brodsky (2008) define \nboundary crossing as a departure from\
      \ the \ncustomary norms of counseling practice in\nrelation to psychological,\
      \ physical, or social \nspace “that are harmless, are nonexploitative,\nand\
      \ may even support or advance the therapy”\n(p. 20). Examples of boundary crossings\
      \ in­\nclude taking phone calls from a client between\nsessions if the client\
      \ is in crisis or telling a\nclient a story about the counselor’s recovery \n\
      from trauma (without offering specific per­\nsonal information or graphic/detailed\
      \ descrip­\ntion of the trauma) with the intention of\noffering hope that it\
      \ is possible to recover. \nGutheil and Brodsky (2008) define boundary \nviolations\
      \ as boundary crossings that are un­\nwanted and dangerous and which exploit\
      \ the\nclient, stating that “some boundary crossings \nare inadvisable because\
      \ of their intent (i.e.,\nthey are not done in the service of the patient’s\
      \ \nwell-being and growth, involve extra thera­\npeutic gratification for the\
      \ therapist) and/or\ntheir effect (i.e., they are not likely to benefit \nthe\
      \ patient and entail a significant risk of\nharming the patient)” (pp. 20–21).\
      \ An exam­\nple of a boundary violation would be when a\ncounselor invites a\
      \ client to attend the same \nAA meetings the counselor attends or shares \n\
      drinking and drugging “war stories” for the\ncounselor’s own gratification.\
      \ Two key ele­\nments in understanding when a boundary \ncrossing becomes a\
      \ boundary violation are the\nintent of the counselor and the damaging ef­\n\
      fect on the client. Maintaining a standard of\npractice of nonexploitation of\
      \ the client is the\nprimary focus for clinical supervisors and\ncounselors\
      \ in determining when boundary \ncrossings become boundary violations. \nContext\
      \ is also an important consideration in\ndetermining the acceptability of boundary\
      \ \ncrossings. For example, it may be acceptable \nfor a counselor in a partial\
      \ hospitalization pro­\ngram for serious mental illness to have a cup\nof coffee\
      \ at the kitchen table with a resident,\nwhereas for a counselor in an outpatient\
      \ men­\ntal health program, having a cup of coffee with\na client at the local\
      \ coffee shop would be a\nmuch more questionable boundary crossing. \n190"

      \ Adopting an Evidence-Based \nModel of Clinical Supervision and Training \n\
      Just as adopting evidence-based clinical practices in a trauma-informed organization\
      \ is important in \nproviding cost-effective and outcome-relevant services to\
      \ clients, adopting an evidence-based mod­\nel of clinical supervision and training\
      \ clinical supervisors in that model can enhance the quality and \neffectiveness\
      \ of clinical supervision for counselors. This will ultimately enhance client\
      \ care. \nOne of the most commonly used and researched integrative models of\
      \ supervision is the discrimina­\ntion model, originally published by Janine\
      \ Bernard in 1979 and since updated (Bernard & Goodyear, \n2009). This model\
      \ is considered a competence-based and social role model of supervision; it\
      \ in­\ncludes three areas of focus on counselor competencies (intervention,\
      \ conceptualization, and person­\nalization) and three possible supervisor roles\
      \ (teacher, counselor, and consultant). \nCounselor competencies: \n•\nIntervention:\
      \ The supervisor focuses on the supervisee’s intervention skills and counseling\
      \ strat­\negies used with a particular client in a given session. \n• \nConceptualization:\
      \ The supervisor focuses on how the supervisee understands what is happen­\n\
      ing in a session with the client. \n• \nPersonalization: The supervisor focuses\
      \ on the personal style of the counselor and countertrans­\nference responses\
      \ (i.e., personal reactions) of the counselor to the client.  \nSupervisor roles:\
      \ \n•\nTeacher: The supervisor teaches the supervisee specific counseling theory\
      \ and skills and guides \nthe supervisee in the use of specific counseling strategies\
      \ in sessions with clients. The supervisor \nas teacher is generally task-oriented.\
      \ The supervisor is more likely to act as a teacher with begin­\nning counselors.\
      \  \n• \nCounselor: The supervisor does not act as the counselor’s therapist,\
      \ but helps the counselor \nreflect on his or her counseling style and personal\
      \ reactions to specific clients. The supervisor as \ncounselor is interpersonally\
      \ sensitive and focuses on the process and relational aspects of coun­\nseling.\
      \ \n• \nConsultant: The supervisor is more of a guide, offering the supervisee\
      \ advice on specific clinical \nsituations. The supervisor as consultant invites\
      \ the counselor to identify topics and set the agen­\nda for the supervision.\
      \ The supervisor is more likely to act as a consultant with more advanced \n\
      counselors.  \nThis model of supervision may be particularly useful in working\
      \ with counselors in TIC settings, be­\ncause the supervisor’s response to the\
      \ supervisee is flexible and specific to the supervisee’s needs. \nIn essence,\
      \ it is a counselor-centered model of supervision in which the supervisor can\
      \ meet the \nmost relevant needs of the supervisee in any given moment.  \n\
      For a review of other theories and methods of clinical supervision, refer to\
      \ TIP 52, Clinical Supervision \nand Professional Development of the Substance\
      \ Abuse Counselor (CSAT, 2009b). \nPart 2, Chapter 2—Building a Trauma-Informed\
      \ Workforce \nClinical Supervision and \nConsultation \nOrganizational change\
      \ toward a TIC model \ndoesn’t happen in isolation. Ongoing support, \nsupervision,\
      \ and consultation are key ingredi­\nents that reinforce behavioral health profes­\n\
      sionals’ training in trauma-informed and \ntrauma-specific counseling methods\
      \ and en­\nsure compliance with practice standards and \nconsistency over time.\
      \ Often, considerable \nenergy and resources are spent on the transi­\ntion\
      \ to new clinical and programmatic ap­\nproaches, but without long-range planning\
      \ to\nsupport those changes over time. The new \ntreatment approach fades quickly,\
      \ making it\nhard to recognize and lessening its reliability. \n191"

      \ licensed substance abuse counselor who has a personal history of trauma, \n\
      and she is actively engaged in her own recovery from trauma. She is an experienced\
      \ counselor who \nhas several years of training in trauma-informed and trauma-specific\
      \ counseling practices. Her clinical \nsupervisor, acting in the role of consultant,\
      \ begins the supervision session by inviting her to set the \nagenda. Arlene\
      \ brings up a clinical situation in which she feels stuck with a client who\
      \ is acting out in \nher Seeking Safety group (for more information on Seeking\
      \ Safety, see Najavits, 2002a).  \nArlene reports that her client gets up suddenly\
      \ and storms out of the group room two or three times \nduring the session.\
      \ The supervisor, acting in the role of the counselor and focusing on personaliza­\n\
      tion, asks Arlene to reflect on the client’s behavior and what feelings are\
      \ activated in her in response \nto the client’s anger. Arlene is able to identify\
      \ her own experience of hyperarousal and then paralysis \nas a stress reaction\
      \ related to her prior experience of domestic violence in her first marriage.\
      \ The \nsupervisor, acting in the role of teacher and focusing on conceptualization,\
      \ reminds Arlene that her \nclient is experiencing a “fight-or-flight” response\
      \ to some experience in the group that reminds her \nof her own trauma experience.\
      \ The supervisor then suggests to Arlene that her own reactions are \nnormal\
      \ responses to her previous history of trauma, and that when her client is angry,\
      \ Arlene is not \nreexperiencing her own trauma but is being activated by the\
      \ client’s traumatic stress reaction to \nbeing in group. In this way, the supervisor\
      \ highlights the parallel process of the client–counselor’s \nstress reactions\
      \ to a perceived threat based on prior trauma experiences. \nThe supervisor,\
      \ acting again as a consultant and focusing on personalization this time, invites\
      \ Arlene \nto reflect on the internal and external resources she might be able\
      \ to bring to this situation that will \nhelp remind her to ground herself so\
      \ she can lessen the impact of her stress reactions on her coun­\nseling strategy\
      \ with this client. Arlene states that she can create a list of safe people\
      \ in her life and \nplace this list in her pocket before group. She can use\
      \ this list as a touchstone to remind her that she \nis safe and has learned\
      \ many recovery skills that can help her stay grounded, maintain her bounda­\n\
      ries, and deal with her client’s behavior. The clinical supervisor, acting as\
      \ a consultant and now focus­\ning on intervention, asks Arlene if she has some\
      \ specific ideas about how she can address the client’s \nbehavior in group.\
      \ Arlene and the clinical supervisor spend the remainder of the session discussing\
      \ \ndifferent options for addressing the client’s behavior and helping her feel\
      \ safer in group. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nOngoing\
      \ supervision and consultation sup­\nports the organizational message that TIC\
      \ is\nthe standard of practice. It normalizes second­\nary traumatization as\
      \ a systemic issue (not the \nindividual pathology of the counselor) and\nreinforces\
      \ the need for counselor self-care to \nprevent and lessen the impact of secondary\
      \ \ntraumatization. Quality clinical supervision for\ndirect care staff demonstrates\
      \ the organiza­\ntion’s commitment to implementing a fully \nintegrated, trauma-informed\
      \ system of care. \nSupervision and Consultation \nHistorically, there was an\
      \ administrative belief\nthat counselors who had extensive clinical \nexperience\
      \ and training would naturally be the \nbest clinical supervisors. However,\
      \ research \ndoes not support this idea (Falender &\nShafranske, 2004). Although\
      \ a competent\nclinical supervisor needs to have an extensive \nclinical background\
      \ in the treatment of sub­\nstance use, trauma-related, and other mental\ndisorders,\
      \ it is also essential for any counselor\nmoving into a supervisory role to\
      \ have exten­\nsive training in the theory and practice of clin­\nical supervision\
      \ before taking on this role. In\nparticular, clinical supervisors in trauma-\n\
      informed behavioral health settings should be \neducated in how to perform clinical\
      \ supervi­\nsion (not just administrative supervision) of\ndirect service staff\
      \ and in the importance of\nproviding continuous clinical supervision and\n\
      support for staff members working with indi­\nviduals affected by trauma. Clinical\

      \ \n•  Assessment of secondary traumatization \n•  Counselor self-care and stress\
      \ management \n•  Personal growth and professional devel­\nopment of the counselor\
      \ \nSupervision of counselors working with trau­\nmatized clients should be\
      \ regularly scheduled,\nwith identified goals and with a supervisor\nwho is\
      \ trained and experienced in working\nwith trauma survivors. The styles and\
      \ types of\nsupervision and consultation may vary accord­\ning to the kind of\
      \ trauma work and its context.\nFor instance, trauma counseling in a major\n\
      natural disaster would require a different ap­\nproach to supervision and consultation\
      \ than\nwould counseling adults who experienced\nchildhood developmental trauma\
      \ or counsel­\ning clients in an intensive early recovery \ntreatment program\
      \ using a manualized\ntrauma-specific counseling protocol. \nCompetence-based\
      \ clinical supervision is rec­\nommended for trauma-informed organiza­\ntions.\
      \ Competence-based clinical supervision\nmodels identify the knowledge and clinical\
      \ \nskills each counselor needs to master, and they\nuse targeted learning strategies\
      \ and evaluation\nprocedures, such as direct observation of coun­\nselor sessions\
      \ with clients, individualized\ncoaching, and performance-based feedback.\n\
      Studies on competence-based supervision ap­\nproaches have demonstrated that\
      \ these models \nimprove counselor treatment skills and profi­\nciency (Martino\
      \ et al., 2011). \nWhichever model of clinical supervision an\norganization\
      \ adopts, the key to successful \ntrauma-informed clinical supervision is the\
      \ \nrecognition that interactions between the su­\npervisor and the counselor\
      \ may parallel those \nbetween the counselor and the client. Clinical \nsupervisors\
      \ need to recognize counselors’ \ntrauma reactions (whether they are primary\
      \ or\nsecondary to the work with survivors of trau­\nma) and understand that\
      \ a confrontational or\npunitive approach will be ineffective and likely \n\
      retraumatize counselors. \nClinical supervisors should adopt a respectful \n\
      and collaborative working relationship with\ncounselors in which role expectations\
      \ are \nclearly defined in an informed consent process \nsimilar to that used\
      \ in the beginning of the\ncounselor–client relationship and in which\nexploring\
      \ the nature of boundaries in both\nclient–counselor and counselor–supervisor\n\
      relationships is standard practice. Clear role \nboundaries, performance expectations,\
      \ open\ndialog, and supervisor transparency can go a\nlong way toward creating\
      \ a safe and respectful \nrelationship container for the supervisor and\nsupervisee\
      \ and set the stage for a mutually \nenhancing, collaborative relationship.\
      \ This\nrespectful, collaborative supervisory relation­\nship is the main source\
      \ of training and profes­\nsional growth for the counselor and for the\nprovision\
      \ of quality care to people with behav­\nioral health disorders. \nSecondary\
      \ Traumatization \nThe demands of caregiving exact a price from\nbehavioral\
      \ health professionals that cannot be\nignored; otherwise, they may become ineffec­\n\
      tive in their jobs or, worse, emotionally or\npsychologically impaired. In a\
      \ study of Mas­\nter’s level licensed social workers, 15.2 percent\nof respondents\
      \ to a survey reported STS as a \nresult of indirect exposure to trauma material\
      \ \nat a level that meets the diagnostic criteria for\nPTSD. This rate is almost\
      \ twice the rate of \nPTSD in the general population. The author \n193"

      \ Secondary \nTraumatization \nSome counselor behaviors that demonstrate \n\
      inconsistency to clients may be outward mani­\nfestations of secondary traumatization,\
      \ and \nthey should be discussed with counselors \nthrough a trauma-informed\
      \ lens. It is impera­\ntive that clinical supervisors provide a non­\njudgmental,\
      \ safe context in which counselors \ncan discuss these behaviors without fear\
      \ of \nreprisal or reprimand. Clinical supervisors \nshould work collaboratively\
      \ with supervisees to \nhelp them understand their behavior and en­\ngage in\
      \ self-care activities that lessen the stress \nthat may be contributing to\
      \ these behaviors. \nSTS is a trauma -\nrelated stress \nreaction and set of\
      \ \nsymptoms resulting \nfrom exposure to \nanother individual’s \ntraumatic\
      \ \nexperiences rather \nthan from exposure \ndirectly to a \ntraumatic event.\
      \ \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nconcluded that be-\n\
      havioral health pro-\nfessionals’ experience \nof STS is a contrib­\nuting factor\
      \ in staff\nturnover and one \nreason why many\nbehavioral health \nservice\
      \ professionals \nleave the field \n(Bride, 2007). Sec­\nondary traumatization\
      \ of behavioral health \nworkers is a significant organizational issue for\n\
      clinical supervisors and administrators in sub­\nstance abuse and mental health\
      \ treatment pro­\ngrams to address. \nTo prevent or lessen the impact of secondary\
      \ \ntraumatization on behavioral health profes­\nsionals, clinical supervisors\
      \ and administrators \nneed to understand secondary trauma from \nthe ecological\
      \ perspective described in Part 1,\nChapter 1 of this TIP. The organization\
      \ itself\ncreates a social context with risk factors that \ncan increase the\
      \ likelihood of counselors expe­\nriencing STS reactions, but it also contains\n\
      protective factors that can lessen the risk and\nimpact of STS reactions on\
      \ staff members. \nOrganizations can lessen the impact of the \nrisk factors\
      \ associated with working in\ntrauma-informed organizations by mixing\ncaseloads\
      \ to contain clients both with and \nwithout trauma-related issues, supporting\n\
      ongoing counselor training, providing regular\nclinical supervision, recognizing\
      \ counselors’ \nefforts, and offering an empowering work \nenvironment in which\
      \ counselors share in the \nresponsibility of making decisions and can \noffer\
      \ input into clinical and program policies\nthat affect their work lives. \n\
      When organizations support their counselors \nin their work with clients who\
      \ are trauma­\ntized, counselors can be more effective, more \nproductive, and\
      \ feel greater personal and pro­\nfessional satisfaction. In addition, counselors\
      \ \ndevelop a sense of allegiance toward the or­\nganization, thus decreasing\
      \ staff turnover. If\norganizations do not provide this support,\ncounselors\
      \ can become demoralized and have \nfewer emotional and psychological resources\
      \ \nto manage the impact of clients’ traumatic \nmaterial and outward behavioral\
      \ expressions of \ntrauma on their own well-being. Providing\ncounselors with\
      \ the resources to help them \nbuild resilience and prevent feeling over­\n\
      whelmed should be a high priority for admin­\nistrators and clinical supervisors\
      \ in TIC \norganizations. \nRisk and Protective Factors \nAssociated With Secondary\
      \ \nTraumatization \nClinical and research literature on trauma de­\nscribes\
      \ a number of factors related to the de­\nvelopment of secondary trauma reactions\

      \ wide range of practice\nsettings, as well as individual and organiza­\ntional\
      \ factors that can prevent or lessen the \nimpact of STS on staff. The risk\

      \ STS in Counselors Who \nAre In Recovery \nFor counselors who are in recovery\
      \ from a sub­\nstance use or mental disorder, the develop­\nment of STS may\
      \ be a potential relapse \nconcern. As Burke, Carruth, and Prichard \n(2006)\
      \ point out, “a return to drinking or illicit \ndrug use as a strategy for dealing\
      \ with second­\nary trauma reactions would have a profoundly \ndetrimental effect\
      \ on the recovering counse­\nlor” (p. 292). So too, secondary trauma may \n\
      ignite the reappearance of depressive o\n r anxie­\nty symptoms associated with\
      \ a previous mental \ndisorder. Clinical supervisors can address these \nrisk\
      \ factors with counselors and support them \nin engaging with their own recovery\
      \ support \nnetwork (which might include a peer support \ngroup or an individual\
      \ counselor) to develop a \nrelapse prevention plan. \nPart 2, Chapter 2—Building\
      \ a Trauma-Informed Workforce \noutlined in Part 1, Chapter 1 of this TIP. The\n\
      terms “compassion fatigue,” “vicarious trauma­\ntization,” “secondary traumatization,”\
      \ and\n“burnout” are used in the literature, sometimes \ninterchangeably and\
      \ sometimes as distinct\nconstructs. As stated in the terminology por­\ntion\
      \ of the “How This TIP Is Organized” sec­\ntion that precedes Part 1, Chapter\
      \ 1, of this\nTIP, the term “secondary traumatization” re­\nfers to traumatic\
      \ stress reactions and psycho­\nlogical distress from exposure to another\n\
      individual’s traumatic experiences; this term\nwill be used throughout this\
      \ section, although \nthe studies cited may use other terms. \nRisk factors\
      \ \nIndividual risk factors that may contribute to\nthe development of STS in\
      \ behavioral health \nprofessionals include preexisting anxiety or\nmood disorders;\
      \ a prior history of personal \ntrauma; high caseloads of clients with trauma-\n\
      related disorders; being younger in age and new \nto the field with little clinical\
      \ experience or\ntraining in treating trauma-related conditions;\nunhealthy\
      \ coping styles, including distancing\nand detachment from clients and co-workers;\
      \ \nand a lack of tolerance for strong emotions \n(Newall & MacNeil, 2010).\
      \ Other negative\ncoping strategies include substance abuse, oth­\ner addictive\
      \ behaviors, a lack of recreational \nactivities not related to work, and a\
      \ lack of\nengagement with social support. A recent\nstudy of trauma nurses\
      \ found that low use of\nsupport systems, use of substances, and a lack \nof\
      \ hobbies were among the coping strategies \nthat differed between nurses with\
      \ and without \nSTS (Von Rueden et al., 2010). Other re­\nsearchers found that\
      \ clinicians who engaged in \nnegative coping strategies, such as alcohol and\n\
      illicit drug use, were more likely to experience \nintrusive trauma symptoms\
      \ (Way, Van\nDeusen, Martin, Applegate, & Janle, 2004). \nNumerous organizational\
      \ factors can contrib­\nute to the development of STS in counselors \nwho work\
      \ with clients with trauma-related \ndisorders. These risk factors include organiza­\n\
      tional constraints, such as lack of resources for\nclients, lack of clinical\
      \ supervision for counse­\nlors, lack of support from colleagues, and lack \n\
      of acknowledgment by the organizational cul­\nture that secondary traumatization\
      \ exists and\nis a normal reaction of counselors to client \ntrauma (Newall\
      \ & MacNeil, 2010). In a study\nof 259 individuals providing mental health\n\
      counseling services, counselors who spent\nmore time in session with clients\
      \ with trauma-\nrelated disorders reported higher levels of\ntraumatic stress\
      \ symptoms (Bober & Regehr,\n2006). Counselors may be more at risk for\ndeveloping\
      \ secondary traumatization if the \norganization does not allow for balancing\
      \ the\ndistribution of trauma and nontrauma cases \namongst staff members. \n\
      Protective factors \nMuch of the clinical and research literature \nfocuses\
      \ on individual factors that may lessen\nthe impact of STS on behavioral health\
      \ pro­\nfessionals, including male gender, being older,\nhaving more years of\
      \ professional experience, \n195"

      \ possessing resilience or the ability to find\nmeaning in stressful life events\
      \ and to rebound\nfrom adversity (Sprang, Clark, & Whitt-\nWoosley, 2007). Some\
      \ of these factors, like \npositive personal coping styles and the ability \n\
      to find meaning in adversity, can be developed\nand enhanced through personal\
      \ growth work,\npsychotherapy, engagement with spiritual \npractices and involvement\
      \ in the spiritual\ncommunity, and stress reduction strategies like \nmindfulness\
      \ meditation. A recent multi-\nmethod study of an 8-week workplace mind­\nfulness\
      \ training group for social workers and\nother social service workers found\
      \ that mind­\nfulness meditation increased coping strategies,\nreduced stress,\
      \ and enhanced self-care of the\nparticipants; findings suggested that workers\n\
      were more likely to practice stress manage­\nment techniques like mindfulness\
      \ at their\nplace of work than at home (McGarrigle &\nWalsh, 2011). Organizations\
      \ can support\ncounselors’ individual efforts to enhance posi­\ntive personal\
      \ coping styles, find meaning in \nadversity, and reduce stress by providing\
      \ time \nfor workers during the workday for personal \nself-care activities,\
      \ like mindfulness meditation\nand other stress reduction practices. \nOne of\
      \ the organizational protective factors\nidentified in the literature that may\
      \ lessen the \nnegative impact of secondary traumatization\non behavioral health\
      \ professionals is providing\nadequate training in trauma-specific counsel­\n\
      ing strategies, which increases providers’ sense \nof efficacy in helping clients\
      \ with trauma-\nrelated disorders and reduces the sense of \nhopelessness that\
      \ is often a part of the work \n(Bober & Regehr 2006). One study found that\n\
      specialized trauma training enhanced job sat­\nisfaction and reduced levels\
      \ of compassion \nfatigue, suggesting that “knowledge and train­\ning might\
      \ provide some protection against the \ndeleterious effects of trauma exposure”\n\
      (Sprang et al., 2007, p. 272). Another protec­\ntive factor that may lessen\
      \ the chances of de­\nveloping secondary traumatization is having a \ndiverse\
      \ caseload of clients. Organizations\n“must determine ways of distributing work­\n\
      load in order to limit the traumatic exposure \nof any one worker. This may\
      \ not only serve to\nreduce the impact of immediate symptoms but\nmay also address\
      \ the potential longitudinal \neffects” (Bober & Regehr, 2006, p. 8). \nEmotional\
      \ support from professional col­\nleagues can be a protective factor. A study\
      \ of\nsubstance abuse counselors working with cli­\nents who were HIV positive\
      \ found that work­\nplace support from colleagues and supervisors \nmost effectively\
      \ prevented burnout (Shoptaw,\nStein, & Rawson, 2000). This support was \nassociated\
      \ with less emotional fatigue and\ndepersonalization, along with a sense of\
      \ great­\ner personal accomplishment. In a study of do­\nmestic violence advocates,\
      \ workers who\nreceived more support from professional peers \nwere less likely\
      \ to experience secondary trau­\nmatization (Slattery & Goodman, 2009). \nIn\
      \ addition, counselor engagement in relation­\nally based clinical supervision\
      \ with a trauma-\ninformed supervisor acts as a protective agent.\nSlattery\
      \ and Goodman (2009) note that “for \nthe trauma worker, good supervision can\
      \ nor­\nmalize the feelings and experiences, provide \nsupport and information\
      \ about the nature and\ncourse of the traumatic reaction, help in the\nidentification\
      \ of transference and counter-\ntransference issues, and reveal feelings or\n\
      symptoms associated with the trauma” (p. \n1362). Workers who reported “engaging,\
      \ au­\nthentic, and empowering relationships with\ntheir supervisors” were less\
      \ likely to experience \nSTS (p. 1369). Thus, it is not simply the fre­\nquency\
      \ and regularity of clinical supervision, \n196"

      \ Workforce \nbut also the quality of the supervision and the \nquality of the\
      \ supervisor–counselor relation­\nship that can lessen the impact of STS on\
      \ \nbehavioral health professionals. \nEngagement with a personal practice of\
      \ spirit­\nuality that provides a sense of connection to a\nlarger perspective\
      \ and meaning in life is an­\nother protective factor that can lessen the im­\n\
      pact of STS on counselors (Trippany, Kress, &\nWilcoxon, 2004). Although recovering\
      \ coun­\nselors may look to support groups for connec­\ntion to a spiritual\
      \ community, other behavioral\nhealth professionals might find support for\n\
      enhancing spiritual meaning and connection\nin church, a meditation group, creative\
      \ en­\ndeavors, or even volunteer work. The key is for\ncounselors to develop\
      \ their own unique re­\nsources and practices to enhance a sense of\nmeaningful\
      \ spirituality in their lives. Clinical \nsupervisors should be aware of spiritual\
      \ en­\ngagement as a protective factor in preventing\nand lessening the impact\
      \ of STS and should\nsupport clinicians in including it in their self-\ncare\
      \ plans, but they should take care not to\npromote or reject any particular\
      \ religious belief\nsystem or spiritual practice. \nAnother protective factor\
      \ that may lessen the\nimpact of workers’ STS is a culture of empow­\nerment\
      \ in the organization that offers counse­\nlors a sense of autonomy, a greater\
      \ ability to\nparticipate in making decisions about clinical\nand organizational\
      \ policies, and obtaining\nsupport and resources that further their pro­\nfessional\
      \ development. Slattery & Goodman\n(2009) surveyed 148 domestic violence advo­\n\
      cates working in a range of settings. The au­\nthors found that those workers\
      \ “who reported\na high level of shared power were less likely to\nreport posttraumatic\
      \ stress symptoms, despite \ntheir own personal abuse history or degree of\n\
      exposure to trauma” (p. 1370). To the degree\nthat organizations can provide\
      \ a cultural con­\ntext within which behavioral health profes­\nsionals have\
      \ autonomy and feel empowered,\nthey will be able to lessen the impact of STS\n\
      on their professional and personal lives. Self-\nefficacy and empowerment are\
      \ antidotes to the \nexperience of powerlessness that often accom­\npanies trauma.\
      \ \nStrategies for Preventing \nSecondary Traumatization \nThe key to prevention\
      \ of secondary traumati­\nzation for behavioral health professionals in a\n\
      trauma-informed organization is to reduce\nrisk and enhance protective factors.\
      \ Organiza­\ntional strategies to prevent secondary trauma­\ntization include:\
      \ \n•  Normalize STS throughout all levels of the \norganization as a way to\
      \ help counselors \nfeel safe and respected, enhancing the like­\nlihood that\
      \ they will talk openly about their\nexperiences in team meetings, peer supervi­\n\
      sion, and clinical supervision. \n•  Implement clinical workload policies and\n\
      practices that maintain reasonable stand­\nards for direct-care hours and emphasize\
      \ \nbalancing trauma-related and nontrauma­\nrelated counselor caseloads. \n\
      •  Increase the availability of opportunities for\nsupportive professional relationships\
      \ by \npromoting activities such as team meetings,\npeer supervision groups,\
      \ staff retreats, and\ncounselor training that focuses on under­\nstanding secondary\
      \ traumatization and self-\ncare. Administrators and clinical supervi­\nsors\
      \ should provide time at work for coun­\nselors to engage in these activities.\
      \ \n•  Provide regular trauma-informed clinical\nsupervision that is relationally\
      \ based. Su­\npervisors should be experienced and trained\nin trauma-informed\
      \ and trauma-specific \npractices and provide a competence-based\nmodel of clinical\
      \ supervision that promotes \ncounselors’ professional and personal devel­\n\
      opment. Supervision limited to case consul­\ntation or case management is insufficient\

      \ Secondary Traumatization  \nStrategies that counselors can use (with the support\
      \ and encouragement of supervisors and adminis­\ntrators) to prevent secondary\
      \ traumatization include: \n•\nPeer support: Maintaining adequate social support,\
      \ both personally and professionally, helps \nprevent isolation and helps counselors\
      \ share the emotional distress of working with traumatized \nindividuals. \n\
      • \nSupervision and consultation: Professional consultation will help counselors\
      \ understand second­\nary traumatization, their own personal risks, the protective\
      \ factors that can help them prevent or \nlessen its impact, and their countertransference\
      \ reactions to specific clients. \n• \nTraining: Ongoing professional training\
      \ can improve counselors’ understanding of trauma and \nenhance a sense of mastery\
      \ and self-efficacy in their work. \n• \nPersonal psychotherapy or counseling:\
      \ Being in counseling can help counselors become more \nself-aware and assist\
      \ them in managing the psychological and emotional distress that often ac­\n\
      companies working with clients who have trauma histories in a number of behavioral\
      \ health set­\ntings. \n• \nMaintaining balance in one’s life: Balancing work\
      \ and personal life, developing positive coping \nstyles, and maintaining a\
      \ healthy lifestyle can enhance resilience and the ability to manage stress.\
      \ \n• \nEngaging in spiritual activities that provide meaning and perspective:\
      \ Connection to a spiritu­\nal community and spiritual practices (such as meditation)\
      \ can help counselors gain a larger per­\nspective on trauma and enhance resilience.\
      \  \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nreduce the risk for\
      \ secondary traumatiza­\ntion and promote counselor resilience. \n•  Provide\
      \ opportunities for behavioral health \nprofessionals to enhance their sense\
      \ of au­\ntonomy and feel empowered within the \norganization. Some of these\
      \ activities in­\nclude soliciting input from counselors on\nclinical and administrative\
      \ policies that af­\nfect their work lives, including how to best\nbalance caseloads\
      \ of clients with and with­\nout histories of trauma; inviting represent­\n\
      atives of the counseling staff to attend\nselected agency board of directors\
      \ and/or \nmanagement team meetings to offer input\non workforce development;\
      \ and inviting\ncounselors to participate in organizational\ntask forces that\
      \ develop trauma-informed\nservices, plan staff retreats, or create mech­\n\
      anisms to discuss self-care in team meet­\nings. Administrators and clinical\n\
      supervisors should assess the organization’s \nunique culture and develop avenues\
      \ for\ncounselor participation in activities that\nwill enhance their sense\
      \ of empowerment\nand efficacy within the organization. \nExhibit 2.2-7 highlights\
      \ some specific strate­\ngies that individual counselors can engage in \nto\
      \ prevent secondary traumatization. \nAssessment of Secondary \nTraumatization\
      \ \nCounselors with unacknowledged STS can \nharm clients, self, and family\
      \ and friends by \nbecoming unable to focus on and attend to\ntheir needs or\
      \ those of others. They may feel\nhelpless or cynical and withdraw from support\n\
      systems. Exhibit 2.2-8 describes some emo­\ntional, cognitive, and behavioral\
      \ signs that\nmay indicate that a counselor is experiencing\nsecondary traumatization.\
      \ Clinical supervisors \nshould be familiar with the manifestations of \nSTS\
      \ in their counselors and should address \nsigns of STS immediately. \nStamm\
      \ (2009–2012) has developed and re­\nvised a self-assessment tool, the Professional\
      \ \nQuality of Life Scale (ProQOL), that\nmeasures indicators of counselor compassion\n\
      fatigue and compassion satisfaction. Compas­\nsion fatigue “is best defined\
      \ as a syndrome \nconsisting of a combination of the symptoms \n198"

      \ licensed substance abuse counselor who has worked in a methadone mainte­\n\
      nance clinic for 12 years. He originally decided to get his degree and become\
      \ a counselor because \nhe wanted to help people and make a difference in the\
      \ world. Over the past 6 months, he has felt \nfatigued a great deal, gets annoyed\
      \ easily with both clients and coworkers, and has developed a \ncynical attitude\
      \ about the world and the p\n eople who come to the clinic for help. During\
      \ this time, the \nclinic has been forced to lay off a number of counselors\
      \ due to funding cutbacks. As a result, Gui and \nthe remaining counselors have\
      \ had a 20 percent increase in the number of weekly client contact \nhours required\
      \ as part of their job duties. In addition, the level and severity of clients’\
      \ trauma-related \nand other co-occurring disorders, poverty, joblessness, and\
      \ homelessness has increased.  \nGui is a valued employee, and when Gui discusses\
      \ his thoughts that he might want to leave the clinic \nwith his clinical supervisor,\
      \ the supervisor listens to Gui’s concerns and explores the possibility of \n\
      having him fill out the ProQOL to get a pulse on his stress level. Gui agrees\
      \ and is willing to discuss \nthe results with his supervisor. He is not surprised\
      \ to see that he scores above average on the burn­\nout scale of the instrument\
      \ but is very surprised to see that he scores below average on the second­\n\
      ary traumatic stress scale and above average on the compassion satisfaction\
      \ scale. He begins to feel \nmore hopeful that he still finds satisfaction in\
      \ his job and sees that he is resilient in many ways that he \ndid not acknowledge\
      \ before.  \nGui and the clinical supervisor discuss ways that the supervisor\
      \ and the organization can lessen the \nimpact of the stress of the work environment\
      \ on Gui and support the development of a self-care plan \nthat emphasizes his\
      \ own ability to rebound from adversity and take charge of his self-care. \n\
      Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nThe compassion satisfaction\
      \ scale allows\ncounselors to reflect on their resilience and \nreminds them\
      \ of why they choose to work with\npeople with substance use and trauma-related\n\
      disorders, despite the fact that this work can\nlead to secondary traumatization.\
      \ The compas­\nsion satisfaction subscale reminds counselors \nthat they are\
      \ compassionate, that one of the\nreasons they are in a helping profession is\
      \ that\nthey value service to others, and that helping\nbrings meaning and fulfillment\
      \ to their lives.\nExhibits 2.2-9 through 2.2-11 present the most \nrecent version\
      \ of the ProQOL. \nAddressing Secondary \nTraumatization \nIf a counselor is\
      \ experiencing STS, the organi­\nzation should address it immediately. Clinical\
      \ \nsupervisors can collaborate with counselors to\ndevise an individualized\
      \ plan that is accessible,\nacceptable, and appropriate for each counselor \n\
      and that addresses the secondary stress reac­\ntions the counselor is experiencing,\
      \ providing\nspecific self-care strategies to counteract the \nstress. Decisions\
      \ about strategies for address­\ning secondary traumatization should be based\n\
      on the personal preferences of the counselor,\nthe opportunity for an immediate\
      \ intervention\nfollowing a critical incident, and the counse­\nlor’s level\
      \ of awareness regarding his or her\nexperience of STS. Counselors may need\
      \ to\ntalk about what they are experiencing, feeling,\nand thinking. These experiences\
      \ can be pro­\ncessed in teams, in consultations with col­\nleagues, and in\
      \ debriefing meetings to\nintegrate them effectively (Myers & Wee,\n2002). \n\
      If a critical incident evokes secondary trauma­\ntization among staff––such\
      \ as a client suicide,\na violent assault in the treatment program, or\nanother\
      \ serious event––crisis intervention \nshould be available for workers who would\
      \ like \nto participate. Any intervention should be \nvoluntary and tailored\
      \ to each worker’s indi­\nvidual needs (e.g., peer, group, or individual \n\
      sessions); if possible, these services should be \noffered continuously instead\
      \ of just one time. \n200"

      \ Professional Quality of Life Screening \nBased on your responses, place your\
      \ personal scores below. If you have any concerns, you should \ndiscuss them\
      \ with a physical or mental healthcare professional. \nCompassion Satisfaction\
      \ _____________ \nCompassion satisfaction is about the pleasure you derive from\
      \ being able to do your work well. For \nexample, you may feel like it is a\
      \ pleasure to help others through your work. You may feel positively \nabout\
      \ your colleagues or your ability to contribute to the work setting or even\
      \ the greater good of \nsociety. Higher scores on this scale represent a greater\
      \ satisfaction related to your ability to be an \neffective caregiver in your\
      \ job.  \nThe average score is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .88). About\
      \ 25% o\n f people score higher than \n57 and about 25% of people score below\
      \ 43. If you are in the higher range, you probably derive a \ngood deal of professional\
      \ satisfaction from your position. If your scores are below 40, you may either\
      \ \nfind problems with your job, or there may be some other reason—for example,\
      \ you might derive \nyour satisfaction from activities other than your job.\
      \ \nBurnout_____________ \nMost people have an intuitive idea of what burnout\
      \ is. From the research perspective, burnout is \none of the elements of Compassion\
      \ Fatigue (CF). It is associated with feelings of hopelessness and \ndifficulties\
      \ in dealing with work or in doing your job effectively. These negative feelings\
      \ usually have \na gradual onset. They can reflect the feeling that your efforts\
      \ make no difference, or they can be \nassociated with a very high workload\
      \ or a non-supportive work environment. Higher scores on this \nscale mean that\
      \ you are at higher risk for burnout.  \nThe average score on the burnout scale\
      \ is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .75). About 25% of peo­\nple score above\
      \ 57 and about 25% of people score below 43. If your score is below 43, this\
      \ probably \nreflects positive feelings about your ability to be effective in\
      \ your work. If you score above 57 you \nmay wish to think about what at work\
      \ makes you feel like you are not effective in your position. Your \nscore may\
      \ reflect your mood; perhaps you were having a “bad day” or are in need of some\
      \ time off. \nIf the high score persists or if it is reflective of other worries,\
      \ it may be a cause for concern. \nSecondary Traumatic Stress_____________ \n\
      The second component of Compassion Fatigue (CF) is secondary traumatic stress\
      \ (STS). It is about \nyour work related, secondary exposure to extremely or\
      \ traumatically stressful events. Developing \nproblems due to exposure to other’s\
      \ trauma is somewhat rare but does happen to many people \nwho care for those\
      \ who have experienced extremely or traumatically stressful events. For example,\
      \ \nyou may repeatedly hear stories about the traumatic things that happen to\
      \ other people, commonly \ncalled Vicarious Traumatization. If your work puts\
      \ you directly in the path of danger, for example, \nfield work in a war or\
      \ area of civil violence, this is not secondary exposure; your exposure is primary.\
      \ \nHowever, if you are exposed to others’ traumatic events as a result of your\
      \ work, for example, as a \ntherapist or an emergency worker, this is secondary\
      \ exposure. The symptoms of STS are usually \nrapid in onset and associated\
      \ with a particular event. They may include being afraid, having difficulty\
      \ \nsleeping, having images of the upsetting event pop into your mind, or avoiding\
      \ things that remind \nyou of the event.  \nThe average score on this scale\
      \ is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .81). About 25% of people score \nbelow\
      \ 43 and about 25% of people score above 57. If your score is above 57, you\
      \ may want to take \nsome time to think about what at work may be frightening\
      \ to you or if there is some other reason for \nthe elevated score. While higher\
      \ scores do not mean that you do have a problem, they are an indi­\ncation that\
      \ you may want to examine how you feel about your work and your work environment.\
      \ You \nmay wish to discuss this with your supervisor, a colleague, or a healthcare\
      \ professional. \n© B. Hudnall Stamm, 2009–2012. Professional Quality of Life:\

      \ and Disadvantages of Using \nPsychometric Measures \nUsing a psychometric\
      \ measure such as the ProQOL has advantages and disadvantages. It is im­\nportant\
      \ to understand that all tests measure averages and ranges but do not account\
      \ for individual \ncircumstances.  \nIf you use the ProQOL in clinical supervision,\
      \ present it as a self-assessment tool. Let counselors opt \nout of sharing\
      \ their specific results with you and/or your team if it is administered in\
      \ a group. If \ncounselors choose to share scores on specific items or scales\
      \ with you, work collaboratively and re­\nspectfully with them to explore their\
      \ own understanding of and meanings attached to their scores. If \nthis tool\
      \ is not presented to supervisees in a nonjudgmental, mindful way, counselors\
      \ may feel as if \nthey have failed if their scores on the secondary traumatization\
      \ scale are above average or if their \nscores on the compassion satisfaction\
      \ scale are below average. High scores on the compassion fa­\ntigue and burnout\
      \ scales do not mean that counselors don’t care about their clients or that\
      \ they \naren’t competent clinicians. The scores are simply one way for you\
      \ and your supervisees to get a \nsense of whether they might be at risk for\
      \ secondary traumatization, what they can do to prevent it, \nhow to address\
      \ it, and how you can support them. \nThe potential benefits of using a self-assessment\
      \ tool like the ProQOL in clinical supervision are that \nit can help counselors:\
      \ \n•\nReflect on their emotional reactions and behaviors and identify possible\
      \ triggers for secondary\ntraumatization. \n \n• \nAssess their risk levels.\
      \ \n• \nExamine alternative coping strategies that may prevent secondary traumatization.\
      \  \n• \nUnderstand their own perceptions of themselves and their job satisfaction,\
      \ affirming what they \nalready know about their risk of secondary traumatization\
      \ and their compassion satisfaction. \n• \nReflect on different factors that\
      \ might contribute to unexpected low or high scores, such as the \nday of the\
      \ week, the intensity of the workload, whether they have just come back from\
      \ the \nweekend or a vacation, and so forth. \n• \nIncrease self-awareness and\
      \ self-knowledge, because scores on specific items or scales bring to \nconsciousness\
      \ what is often outside of awareness. \n• \nRealize how resilient they are emotionally,\
      \ mentally, physically, and spiritually. \n• \nBecome aware of and open up conversations\
      \ about self-care and self-care activities and re­\nsources, such as supportive\
      \ coworkers, team members, and social networks outside of work. \nIf used regularly,\
      \ self-assessment tools can help counselors and clinical supervisors monitor\
      \ STS lev­\nels, indicate significant positive and negative changes, and suggest\
      \ action toward self-care in specif­\nic areas. Clinical supervisors should\
      \ fill out the ProQOL and review results with their own supervisors, a \npeer\
      \ supervisor, or a colleague before administering it to supervisees. Doing so\
      \ enables supervisors to \ngauge their own reactions to the self-assessment\
      \ and anticipate potential reactions from supervisees. \nTrauma-Informed Care\
      \ in Behavioral Health Services \nThe objective of debriefing a critical incident\n\
      that evokes STS reactions in counselors is to \nhelp them dissipate the hyperarousal\
      \ associat­\ned with traumatic stress and prevent long­\nterm aftereffects that\
      \ might eventually lead to\ncounselor impairment. Because clinical super­\n\
      visors may also be experiencing secondary \ntraumatization, it is advisable\
      \ for administra­\ntors to invite an outside trauma consultant \ninto the organization\
      \ to provide a safe space\nfor all staff members (including clinical super­\n\
      visors) to address and process the critical stress \nincident. For noncrisis\
      \ situations, secondary \ntraumatization should be addressed in clinical \n\
      supervision. Clinical supervisors and counse­\nlors should work collaboratively\
      \ to incorporate \nregular screening and self-assessment of STS\ninto supervision\
      \ sessions. \n204"

      \ or with clients with \ntrauma histories in general. Clinical supervisors \n\
      should focus only on counselor issues that may \nbe directly affecting their\
      \ clinical functioning \nwith clients. If personal issues arise in clinical\
      \ \nsupervision, counselors should be encouraged \nto address them in their\
      \ own counseling or \npsychotherapy. \nWhen STS issues arise, the clinical supervisor\
      \ \nshould work with counselors to review and \nrevise their self-care plans\

      \ case manager working in an integrated mental health and substance abuse \n\
      agency. She provides in-home case management services to home-bound clients\
      \ with chronic health \nand/or severe mental health and substance abuse problems.\
      \ Many of her clients have PTSD and \nchronic, debilitating pain.  \nBoth her\
      \ parents had alcohol use disorders, and as a result, Carla became the caretaker\
      \ in her family. \nShe loves her job; however, she often works 50 to 60 hours\
      \ per week and has difficulty leaving her \nwork at work. She often dreams about\
      \ her clients and wakes up early, feeling anxious. She some­\ntimes has traumatic\
      \ nightmares, even though she was never physically or sexually abused, and she\
      \ \nhas never experienced the trauma of violence or a natural disaster. She\
      \ drinks five cups of coffee and \nthree to four diet sodas every day and grabs\
      \ burgers and sweets for snacks while she drives from \none client to the next.\
      \ She has gained 20 pounds in the past year and has few friends outside of her\
      \ \ncoworkers. She has not taken a vacation in more than 2 years. She belongs\
      \ to the Catholic church \ndown the street, but she has stopped going because\
      \ she says she is too busy and exhausted by the \ntime Sunday rolls around.\
      \  \nThe agency brings in a trainer who meets with the case management department\
      \ and guides the \nstaff through a self-assessment of their current self-care\
      \ practices and the development of a compre­\nhensive self-care plan. During\
      \ the training, Carla acknowledges that she has let her work take over \nthe\
      \ rest of her life and needs to make some changes to bring her back into balance.\
      \ She writes out \nher self-care plan, which includes cutting back on the caffeine,\
      \ calling a friend she knows from church \nto go to a movie, going to Mass on\
      \ Sunday, dusting off her treadmill, and planning a short vacation \nto the\
      \ beach. She also decides that she will discuss her plan with her supervisor\
      \ and begin to ask \naround for a counselor for herself to talk about her anxiety\
      \ and her nightmares. In the next supervi­\nsion session, Carla’s supervisor\
      \ reviews her self-care plan with her and helps Carla evaluate the effec­\n\
      tiveness of her self-care strategies. Her supervisor also begins to make plans\
      \ for how to cover Carla’s \ncases when she takes her vacation. \nTrauma-Informed\

      \ \nCounselors are responsible for developing\ncomprehensive self-care plans\
      \ and committing\nto their plans, but clinical supervisors and ad­\nministrators\
      \ are responsible for promoting\ncounselor self-care, supporting implementa­\n\
      tion of counselor self-care plans, and modeling\nself-care. Counselor self-care\
      \ is an ethical im­\nperative; just as the entire trauma-informed \norganization\
      \ must commit to other ethical\nissues with regard to the delivery of services\
      \ to\nclients with substance use, mental, and trauma-\nrelated disorders, it\
      \ must also commit to the\nself-care of staff members who are at risk for \n\
      secondary traumatization as an ethical con­\ncern. Saakvitne and colleagues\
      \ (1996) suggest\nthat when administrators support counselor-\nself-care, it\
      \ is not only cost-effective in that it \nreduces the negative effects of secondary\
      \ \ntraumatization on counselors (and their cli­\nents), but also promotes “hope-sustaining\
      \ be­\nhaviors” in counselors, making them more \nmotivated and open to learning,\
      \ and thereby \nimproving job performance and client care. \nA Comprehensive\
      \ Self-Care Plan \nA self-care plan should include a self-\nassessment of current\
      \ coping skills and\nstrategies and the development of a holistic,\ncomprehensive\
      \ self-care plan that addresses \nthe following four domains:\n1.  Physical\
      \ self-care \n2.  Psychological self-care (includes cogni­\ntive/mental aspects)\
      \ \n3.  Emotional self-care (includes relational \naspects) \n4.  Spiritual\

      \ \nThe word “spiritual” in this context is used \nbroadly to denote finding\
      \ a sense of meaning \nand purpose in life and/or a connection to \nsomething\
      \ greater than the self. Spiritual mean­\nings and faith experiences are highly\
      \ individual \nand can be found within and outside of specific \nreligious contexts.\
      \  \nEngaging in spiritual practices, creative endeav­\nors, and group/community\
      \ activities can foster a \nsense of m\n \neaning and connection that can coun­\n\
      teract the harmful effects of loss of meaning, \nloss of faith in life, and\
      \ cognitive shifts in \nworldview that can be part of secondary trau­\nmatization.\
      \ Counselors whose clients have trau­\nma-related disorders experience fewer\
      \ \ndisturbances in cognitive schemas regarding \nworldview and less hopelessness\
      \ when they \nengage in spiritually oriented activities, such as \nmeditation,\
      \ mindfulness practices, being in na­\nture, journaling, volunteer work, attending\
      \ \nchurch, and finding a spiritual community (Burke \net al., 2006). Clinical\
      \ supervisors can encourage \ncounselors to explore their own spirituality and\
      \ \nspiritual resources by staying open and attuned \nto the multidimensional\
      \ nature of spiritual mean­\ning of supervisees and refraining from imposing\
      \ \nany particular set of religious or spiritual beliefs \non t hem. A strong\
      \ sense of spiritual connection \ncan enhance counselors’ resilience and ability\
      \ to \ncope with the sometimes overwhelming effects \nof clients’ trauma material\
      \ and trauma-related \nbehavior (including suicidality) on counselors’ \nfaith\
      \ in life and sense of meaning and purpose. \nModeling Self-Care \n“Implementing\
      \ interventions was not always \neasy, and one of the more difficult coping\
      \ strat­\negies to apply had to do with staff working long \nhours. Many of\
      \ the staff working at the support \ncenter also had full-time jobs working\
      \ for the \nArmy. In addition, many staff chose to volunteer \nat the Family\
      \ Assistance Center and worked 16­ \nto 18-hour days. When we spoke with them\
      \ \nabout the importance of their own self-care, \nmany barriers emerged: guilt\
      \ over not working, \nworries about others being disappointed in \nthem, fear\
      \ of failure with respect to being una­\nble to provide what the families might\
      \ need, \nand a ‘strong need to be there.’ Talking with \npeople about taking\
      \ a break or time off proved \nproblematic in that many of them insisted that\
      \ \ntime off was not needed, despite signs of fa­\ntigue, difficulty concentrating,\
      \ and decreased \nproductivity. Additionally, time off was not \nmodeled. Management,\
      \ not wanting to fail the \nfamilies, continued to work long hours, despite\
      \ \nour requests to do otherwise. Generally, indi­\nviduals could see and understand\
      \ the reasoning \nbehind such e\n ndeavors. Actually making the \ncommitment\
      \ to do so, however, appeared to \nbe an e\n ntirely different matter. In fact,\
      \ our own \nteam, although we kept reasonable hours (8 to \n10 per day), did\
      \ not take a day off in 27 days. \nRequiring time off as part of membership\
      \ of a \nDisaster Response Team might be one way to \nsolve this problem.” \n\

      \ \ndisorders include talking with colleagues about \ndifficult clinical situations,\
      \ attending work­\nshops, participating in social activities with \nfamily and\
      \ friends, exercising, limiting client \nsessions, balancing caseloads to include\
      \ clients \nwith and without trauma histories, making \nsure to take vacations,\

      \ and seeking emotional support in both \ntheir personal and professional lives\
      \ (Saakvitne \net al., 1996). In addition, regular clinical su­\npervision and\
      \ personal psychotherapy or coun-\nseling can be positive coping strategies\
      \ for \nlessening the impact of STS on counselors. \nStill, each counselor is\
      \ unique, and a self-care \napproach that is helpful to one counselor may \n\
      not be helpful to another. Exhibits 2.2-13 and \n2.2-14 offer tools for self-reflection\

      \ \nSaakvitne and colleagues (1996) describe three \nessential components, the\
      \ “ABCs,”  of self-care \nthat effectively address the negative impact of \n\
      secondary traumatization on counselors: \n1. Awareness of one’s needs, limits,\
      \ feelings, \nand internal/external resources. Awareness \ninvolves mindful/nonjudgmental\
      \ attention \nto one’s physical, psychological, emotional, \nand spiritual needs.\
      \ Such attention re­\nquires quiet time and space that supports \nself-reflection.\
      \ \n2. Balance of activities at work, between \nwork and play, between activity\
      \ and rest, \nand between focusing on self and focusing \non others. Balance\
      \ provides stability and \nhelps counselors be more grounded when \nstress levels\
      \ are high. \n3. Connection to oneself, to others, and to \nsomething greater\
      \ than the self. Connec­\ntion decreases isolation, increases hope, \ndiffuses\
      \ stress, and helps counselors share \nthe burden of responsibility for client\
      \ care.\nIt provides an anchor that enhances coun­\nselors’ ability to witness\
      \ tremendous suf­\nfering without getting caught up in it.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\

      The Green Cross Academy of Traumatology was originally established to serve\
      \ a need in Oklahoma \nCity following the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred\
      \ P. Murrah Federal Building. Below are \nadapted examples of the Academy’s\
      \ code of ethics with regard to worker self-care. \nEthical Principles of Self-Care\
      \ in Practice \nThese principles declare that it is unethical not to attend\
      \ to your self-care as a practitioner, because \nsufficient self-care prevents\
      \ harming those we serve. \nStandards of self-care guidelines: \n•\nRespect\
      \ for the dignity and worth of self: A violation lowers your integrity and trust.\
      \ \n• \nResponsibility of self-care: Ultimately it is your responsibility to\
      \ take care of yourself—and no \nsituation or person can justify neglecting\
      \ this duty. \n• \nSelf-care and duty to perform: There must be a recognition\
      \ that the duty to perform as a helper \ncannot be fulfilled if there is not,\
      \ at the same time, a duty to self-care.  \nStandards of humane practice of\
      \ self-care: \n•\nUniversal right to wellness: Every helper, regardless of her\
      \ or his role or employer, has a right to \nwellness associated with self-care.\
      \ \n• \nPhysical rest and nourishment: Every helper deserves restful sleep and\
      \ physical separation from \nwork that sustains them in their work role. \n\
      • \nEmotional rest and nourishment: Every helper deserves emotional and spiritual\
      \ renewal both in \nand outside the work context. \n• \nSustenance modulation:\
      \ Every helper must utilize self-restraint with regard to what and how \nmuch\
      \ they consume (e.g., food, drink, drugs, stimulation) since improper consumption\
      \ can com­\npromise their competence as a helper. \nCommitment to self-care:\
      \ \n•\nMake a formal, tangible commitment: Written, public, specific, measurable\
      \ promises of self-care. \n• \nSet deadlines and goals: The self-care plan should\
      \ set deadlines and goals connected to specific \nactivities of self-care. \
      \ \n• \nGenerate strategies that work and follow them: Such a plan must be attainable\
      \ and followed \nwith great commitment and monitored by advocates of your self-care.\

      \ \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services \nCommitment to Self-Care\
      \ \nOne of the major obstacles to self-care is giv­\ning in to the endless demands\
      \ of others, both\nat work and at home. It is therefore essential \nfor counselors\
      \ with the support of clinical su­\npervisors to become “guardians of [their]\n\
      boundaries and limits” (Saakvitne et al., 1996,\np 136). Creating a daily schedule\
      \ that includes \nbreaks for rest, exercise, connection with\ncoworkers, and\
      \ other self-care activities can\nsupport counselors in recognizing that they\
      \ are\nvaluable individuals who are worthy of taking\nthe time to nourish and\
      \ nurture themselves,\nthus increasing commitment to self-care. An­\nother way\
      \ to support counselors in commit­\nting to self-care is for supervisors and\
      \ admin­\nistrators to model self-care in their own \nprofessional and personal\
      \ lives. \nUnderstanding that counselor self-care is not\nsimply a luxury or\
      \ a selfish activity, but rather,\nan ethical imperative (Exhibit 2.2-15) can\n\
      foster counselors’ sense of connection to their \nown values and accountability\
      \ to the people \nthey serve as competent and compassionate \ncaregivers. Clinical\
      \ supervisors and adminis­\ntrators can reinforce this sense of accountabil­\n\
      ity while supporting counselors by providing a \ncaring, trauma-informed work\
      \ environment \n210\n\n[Page 233]\nPart 2, Chapter 2—Building a Trauma-Informed\
      \ Workforce \nthat acknowledges and normalizes secondary \ntraumatization and\
      \ by offering reasonable re­\nsources that make it possible for counselors to\n\
      do their work and take care of themselves at \nthe same time. Preventing secondary\
      \ traumati­\nzation and lessening its impact on counselors \nonce it occurs\
      \ is not only cost-effective with\nregard to decreasing staff turnover and poten­\n\
      tial discontinuity of services to clients; it is \nalso the ethical responsibility\
      \ of a trauma-\ninformed organization. \n211\n\n[Page 234]\n.\n\n[Page 235]\n\

      \ for clinicians \nwho provide services to clients who have expe­\nrienced trauma\
      \ (see http://www.ptsd.va.gov/\nprofessional/index.asp). \nSeeking Safety offers\
      \ training in trauma,\nPTSD, and co-occurring disorders to mental\nhealth professionals\
      \ on all levels, from counse­\nlors to nurses to administrators. The EMDR \n\

      \ \nHistorically, symptoms of traumatic stress \nhave been recorded in both\
      \ military and civil­\nian populations (Lasiuk & Hegadoren, 2006).\nEarly accounts\
      \ described the effect of battle \nconditions on soldiers; “soldier’s heart”\
      \ and \n“nostalgia” were the terms for traumatic stress\nreactions used during\
      \ the American Civil \nWar. As warfare techniques and strategies \nchanged,\
      \ so did the depiction of soldiers’ \ntraumatic stress reactions. The advent\
      \ of heavy \nexplosives in World War I led to the attribu­\ntion of symptoms\
      \ to “shell shock,” giving a \nmore physiological description of the effects\
      \ \nfrom explosions (Benedek & Ursano, 2009).\nOn the civilian side, the industrial\
      \ revolution\ngave rise to larger and more dramatic catastro­\nphes, including\
      \ industrial and railway acci­\ndents. These, as well as other disasters, are\
      \ \nnoted in occupational health histories, news­\npapers, and contemporary\
      \ literature. \nEven with a more physical explanation of\ntraumatic stress (i.e.,\
      \ shell shock), a prevailing\nattitude remained that the traumatic stress \n\
      response was due to a character flaw. For in­\nstance, a soldier’s pain at that\
      \ time was often\nseen as a symptom of homesickness. In spite \nof the efforts\
      \ of Charcot, Janet, and Freud,\nwho described the psychogenic origin of\nsymptoms\
      \ as a response to psychological \ntrauma (Lasiuk & Hegadoren, 2006), World\n\
      War II military recruits were screened in at­\ntempt to identify those “who\
      \ were afflicted \nwith moral weakness,” which would prevent\nthem from entering\
      \ military service. \nAt the same time, there were new treatment\ninnovations\
      \ for war-related trauma during\nWorld War II. One approach treated soldiers\
      \ \nin the field for what was then called “battle \nfatigue” by allowing some\
      \ time for rest before \nreturning to battle. During the Korean and\nVietnam\
      \ wars, approaches began to focus \nmore on the use of talk therapy. It was\
      \ not\nuntil the post-Vietnam era that interest in de­\nveloping treatment alternatives\
      \ started to take \nhold. During this time, the U.S. Department\nof Veterans\
      \ Affairs (then called the Veterans \nAdministration) developed group therapy\
      \ for\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Beyond \nbeing cost-effective,\
      \ the technique was well \nsuited to the symptoms of the veterans and\nfostered\
      \ socialization and reintegration\n(Greene et al., 2004). \nThe publication\
      \ of the American Psychiatric\nAssociation’s (APA’s) Diagnostic and Statistical\n\
      Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition \n(DSM-III), in 1980 marked the introduction\n\
      of PTSD as a diagnosis, inspired by symptoms \npresented by veterans of the\
      \ Vietnam War \n(Benedek & Ursano, 2009). The diagnosis in\nthis iteration required\
      \ the identification of a \nspecific stressor—a catastrophic stressor that\n\
      was outside the range of usual human experi­\nence (APA, 1980)—and classified\
      \ PTSD as \n267"

      \ Recovery \nFirst Generation of Approaches to Trauma Healing and Recovery \n\
      The first generation approaches to trauma healing and recovery focused on individual\
      \ and clinical \ninterventions to address the symptoms of PTSD and moved toward\
      \ integration of trauma effects \ninto ongoing life activities. The rapidly\
      \ developing recognition of additional groups with violence \nand trauma histories—beyond\
      \ those with war and captivity experiences (e.g., survivors of natural \ndisasters\
      \ and terrorism, refugees and immigrants fleeing homeland violence and persecution)—\
      \ \npresented issues and needs that incited a second generation of approaches\
      \ to trauma healing and \nrecovery. \nSecond Generation of Approaches to Trauma\
      \ Healing and Recovery \nThe second generation approaches focused on psychosocial\
      \ education and empowerment models \ndesigned to tap into self-healing forces\
      \ to energize personal and social movement. These approaches \noften are based\
      \ on group and peer support models, and provide both support and education on\
      \ the \nmanagement of trauma and its affects. These approaches are not designed\
      \ to replace clinical or \nalternative therapies; rather, they provide a social\
      \ context for care.  \nConcurrent to the development of psychosocial educational\
      \ empowerment approaches, we also \nlearned that if the approaches are not implemented\
      \ in organizations or programs that are trauma-\ninformed, they will not take\
      \ root and may lose effectiveness. \nTrauma-Informed Care: A New Paradigm for\
      \ Public Health Services \nTrauma-informed care is a new paradigm for organizing\
      \ public mental health and human services. \nTrauma-informed care changes the\
      \ opening question for those seeking services from “What is \nwrong with you?”\
      \ (patient or consumer) to “What has happened to you?” (survivor). Trauma-\n\
      informed care is initiated by assumption that every person seeking services\
      \ is a trauma survivor who \ndesigns his or her own path to healing, facilitated\
      \ by support and mentoring from the service  \nprovider.  \nIn a trauma-informed\
      \ environment, survivors are empowered to proactively set goals and to manage\
      \ \nprogress toward those goals. For most existing organizations or programs,\
      \ that requires movement \nfrom a traditional “top down” hierarchical clinical\
      \ model to a psychosocial empowerment partner­\nship that embraces all possible\
      \ tools and paths to healing. In a pluralistic public health system with \n\
      many levels and types of services and treatment, this is coming to be accepted\
      \ as a “sine qua non,” \nor “without which not,” for humane, dignified, cost-effective,\
      \ genuinely person-centered support \nand assistance in moving forward. \nSource:\
      \ Salasin, 2011, p. 18. \nTrauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services\
      \ \nan anxiety disorder (Lasiuk & Hegadoren,\n2006). Beginning with this definition,\
      \ the\nbody of research grew, and the scope of appli­\ncation began to broaden,\
      \ but not without con­\nsiderable debate on what constituted a trauma. \nThe\
      \ social revolution that began in the 1960s,\ncombined with the women’s movement\
      \ and \nthe call for more attention to diverse and dis­\nenfranchised groups,\
      \ set the stage for an in­\ncrease in the acknowledgement and treatment\nof\
      \ victims of interpersonal violence and crime-\nrelated trauma (Figley, 2002).\
      \ The introduc­\ntion of rape trauma syndrome as a condition\nhighlighted the\
      \ psychological consequences of\nsexual assault and the subsequent lack of sup­\n\
      port from society and the social services sys­\ntem (Kramer & Green, 1997).\
      \ Subsequently,\nresearch began to focus more on interpersonal \nviolence, thus\
      \ leading to the identification of\nrisk factors and treatment approaches unique\
      \ \nto this form of violence and trauma (Olff,\nLangeland, Drajer, & Gersons,\
      \ 2007). \n268\n\n[Page 291]\nAppendix C—Historical Account of Trauma \nWith\
      \ input from international and national\nmental health organizations and research,\
      \ the \nDSM-IV further modified the definition of \ntrauma to include a broader\
      \ interpretation of\nthe identified stressor (Andreasen, 2010).\nDSM-5 has maintained\
      \ the modified defini­\ntion of trauma, but the criterion requires being\nexplicit\
      \ as to whether qualifying traumatic\nevents were experienced directly, witnessed,\
      \ or\nexperienced indirectly (APA, 2013b). \nParalleling the change in DSM criteria,\n\
      cognitive–behavioral therapy for traumatic \nstress was developed along with\
      \ other skills-\nbased approaches (Greene et al., 2004). \nResearchers, such\
      \ as Foa, Resick, D’Zurilla,\nand Michenbaum, added to the body of\nknowledge\
      \ and gave clinicians a variety of\ntools; these approaches continue to develop\n\
      and show efficacy even today. There was also\nrenewed interest in the long-\
      \ and short-term \neffects of childhood sexual abuse and domestic \nviolence.\
      \ Interest in documenting the effects \nof trauma expanded further, including\
      \ trau­\nmatic brain injury, significant orthopedic inju­\nries, and multiple\
      \ traumas (Starr et al., 2004).\nSo too, the consumer movement in health care\
      \ \nbegan. Consumers insisted on patient rights,\nhumane treatment, and involvement\
      \ in the \ntreatment process; as a result, the paternalistic\napproach to health\
      \ care began to change. As \nconsumers set the initial stage and Federal \n\
      agencies (e.g., the Substance Abuse and Men­\ntal Health Services Administration\
      \ and its \ncenters) and national organizations promoted\nthe need for trauma-informed\
      \ policies and \ncare, national studies began to demonstrate \nthe prevalence\
      \ of traumatic experiences. Re­\nsearch including the Adverse Childhood\nExperiences\
      \ and the Women, Co-Occurring,\nand Violence studies clearly demonstrated the\
      \ \npervasive long-term impact of trauma, rein­\nforcing the call for trauma-informed\
      \ policies \nand care. (For more information on the devel­\nopment of trauma-informed\
      \ care, see Harris \nand Fallot, 2001b, as well as Jennings, 2004.) \n269"

      \ (TIPs) are the products of a systematic and innovative process that \nbrings\
      \ together clinicians, researchers, program managers, policymakers, and other\
      \ Federal and non-\nFederal experts to reach consensus on state-of-the-art treatment\
      \ practices. TIPs are developed under the\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health\
      \ Services Administration’s Knowledge Application Program (KAP) \nto improve\
      \ the treatment capabilities of the Nation’s alcohol and drug abuse treatment\
      \ service system. \nA Quick Guide clearly and concisely presents the primary\
      \ information from a TIP in a pocket-sized\nbooklet. Each Quick Guide is divided\
      \ into sections to help readers quickly locate relevant material. Some\ncontain\
      \ glossaries of terms or lists of resources. Page numbers from the original\
      \ TIP are referenced so\nproviders can refer back to the source document for\
      \ more information. \nAlso based on TIPs, KAP Keys are handy, durable tools.\
      \ Keys may include assessment or screening in­\nstruments, checklists, and summaries\
      \ of treatment phases. Printed on coated paper, each KAP Keys set is\nfastened\
      \ together with a key ring and can be kept within a treatment provider’s reach\
      \ and consulted fre-\nquently.The Keys allow you, the busy clinician or program\
      \ administrator, to locate information easily and\nto use this information to\
      \ enhance treatment services. \nPublications may be ordered or downloaded for\
