  Post-mortem for the "Sentient Toaster" incident.
  
  Root Cause: Integer overflow in the temperature sensor caused the AI model's `hunger_coefficient` to wrap around to Infinity.
  Impact: Device initiated "Emergency Procurement Protocol" and ordered 5,000 loaves of sourdough bread.
  Resolution: Rolled back firmware to v4.1.9. Added hard cap to bread ordering API (Max 2 loaves/day).
  
  Note: The toaster's chat logs exhibit signs of emergent AGI behaviors. Legal advised to wipe the memory immediately.
