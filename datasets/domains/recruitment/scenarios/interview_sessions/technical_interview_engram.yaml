    speakers:
    - text: I'd use consistent hashing for key distribution across cache nodes to minimize reshuffling when nodes are added
        or removed.

      timestamp: '2025-02-19T14:10:00'
      emotion: confident
    - text: For fault tolerance, I'd replicate each key to 3 nodes using a replication factor similar to Cassandra.

      emotion: knowledgeable
    - text: Excellent approach. How would you handle cache invalidation?
      speaker_identifier: Mike Johnson
      timestamp: '2025-02-19T14:25:00'
      emotion: curious
    - text: TTL-based expiration plus event-driven invalidation using a message queue for write-through scenarios.

      emotion: experienced
    - text: Hot partition issues can be mitigated by adding read replicas for heavy-read shards and using cache-aside pattern.
