Interviewer: Alice Voronina

User: Sarah J. (Dog owner, Golden Retriever)
Feedback:
"Honestly, I don't need another social network. I have Instagram for my dog photos. I don't use the 'Sniff' feature at all."
"But... that little tool you added in the settings? The one that auto-schedules my vet appointments based on the vaccination records? THAT IS AMAZING. I would pay $20/month just for that."

User: Mike T. (Cat owner, 3 cats)
Feedback:
"The app is buggy. The feed is empty. But I uploaded my cat's medical history to the 'Vault' feature and it saved me when I had to go to the emergency vet at 2 AM. Can you make that the main app?"

User: Dr. Emily Chen (Veterinarian)
Feedback:
"I wish my clients used a system like this. Pawsible's social features are noise, but the record-keeping API is cleaner than what we use at the clinic."

---
KEY INSIGHT:
Everyone hates the social network. Everyone loves the medical record automation.
