  Late night strategy session between Alice (CEO) and Raj (CTO).
  
  Reviewing the disastrous engagement metrics for the social app (DAU < 100).
  Contrasting with the insane retention on the "Medical Vault" feature.
  
  DECISION: We are pivoting. 
  1. Shut down Pawsible social feed immediately.
  2. Rebrand as "VetOS" - An AI-powered operating system for Veterinarian clinics.
  3. Cancel the PetCo partnership (ads); start selling B2B SaaS.
