Scribe: Marcus Tiro

---
Session opened by Consul Mark Antony.

SENATOR CICERO:
"Citizens! The granaries of Ostia are empty. The mob grows restless in the Subura. Where is the Egyptian fleet? It is three weeks overdue."

SENATOR CASCA:
"Perhaps Poseidon favors us not. The winds have been southerly for a fortnight."

MARK ANTONY:
"Silence! I have received word from the Port of Alexandria. They claim the ships sailed on the Kalends of February. If they are not here, it is piracy, not wind."

RESOLUTION:
The Senate authorizes Pompey the Younger to patrol the Tyrrhenian Sea for pirates. 
Budget allocated: 5,000 Denarii.

NOTES:
Riots reported near the Temple of Vesta. Bread prices have tripled since the Nones of February.
