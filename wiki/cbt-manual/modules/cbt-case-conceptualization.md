Module 4: Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning 
 
Objectives 
• 
To better understand the role of case conceptualization in cognitive-behavioral 
therapy. 
• 
To develop specific case conceptualization skills, including: 
 
 
a) Assessing patient concerns/difficulties 
 
 
b) Establishing a treatment plan (goal setting) 
 
 
c) Identifying treatment obstacles  
 
What are case conceptualization and treatment planning, and why are they important in 
Brief CBT? 
 
Case conceptualization is a framework used to 1) understand the patient and his/her 
current problems, 2) inform treatment and intervention techniques and 3) serve as a 
foundation to assess patient change/progress. Case conceptualization also aids in 
establishing rapport and a sense of hope for patients. 
 
 
Case conceptualization is vital to effective treatment and represents a defining 
characteristic of expert clinicians. Using these skills, clinicians are better able to define a 
treatment plan using intervention techniques that provide the best opportunities for 
change. This focused and informed approach provides the roadmap for both patients and 
therapists and should include a foundation for assessing change/progress. Case 
conceptualization is particularly important for short-term therapy, as it serves to focus both 
the patient and clinician on the salient issues so as to avoid ancillary problems that often 
serve as distractions to core goals.  
 
When? (Indications/Contraindications) 
 
 
Conceptualization should begin during the first session and become increasingly 
refined as treatment progresses. 
 
An assessment of current difficulties and the creation of a problem list should occur 
during the first session.  
 
A treatment plan (including treatment goals) should be addressed early in treatment 
(sessions 1, 2). Early conceptualization and treatment planning may require 
modification as additional information becomes available.  
 
Treatment plans and goals should be routinely revisited to ensure that the patient is 
improving and agrees with the flow of the therapeutic work.

How? (Instructions/Handouts) 
 
Case Conceptualization Step 1:  Assessing Patient Concerns/Difficulties 
 
The patient's presenting concerns and current functioning can be assessed in a number of 
different ways. The following section outlines several possible avenues for identification of 
problems/concerns. 
 
A)  Using established self-report symptom inventories. A common practice in CBT involves 
the use of self-report symptom measures to assess baseline functioning as well as 
therapeutic progress. Frequently used measures for depression and anxiety include Beck 
Depression Inventory – Second Edition, Patient Health Questionnaire (depression), Geriatric 
Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. 
 
Self-report measures are often completed by patients while in the waiting room and 
evaluated by the clinician during the session. Often self-report measures can serve as a 
routine agenda item during CBT sessions and can highlight important improvements and/or 
continuing symptoms.  Information obtained from these self-report inventories can also 
provide insight into the way the patient thinks and behaves and factors that might be 
important areas of need. 
 
B)  Problem lists. These are a common and useful strategy for identifying the psychological, 
social, occupational, and financial difficulties faced by patients. Therapists who used 
problem lists typically elicit a list of five to 10 difficulties from the patient during the first part 
of session 1. Problems are best identified using open-ended questions (e.g., “What brings 
you to this clinic?” “What issues would you like to focus on in our work together?”). Problems 
are best described in terms of symptom frequency (How often does the symptom occur?), 
intensity (How mild or severe is it?) and functional impact (What influence does the 
symptom have on daily functioning or general distress?).  
 
Some patients may describe their difficulties or goals in vague or abstract ways, such as, “I 
want to improve my life, or I want to be happy again.” Problems and subsequent goals are 
best described in specific terms to maintain clinical focus. For example, specific problems 
are listed in the following table.

C) Assessing cognitions.  Within the CBT model, it is often helpful to examine the patient's 
thoughts especially as they are perceived by the patient. A commonly used, structured wa
to examine these factors is to assess (ask questions related to) how the patient perceives 
him-/herself, others, and the future. For example, a patient might describe him- or herself as 
incapable, not useful, or a burden. He or she may generally perceive others to be critical or 
hard to please. And his/her  view of the future might be largely pessimistic and contain 
beliefs that the future will include only more losses and disappointments (see also Thought 
Records in Modules 9 and 10). 
 
D)  Assessing behaviors and precipitating situations. Precipitating situations are events, 
behaviors, thoughts, or emotions that activate, trigger, or compound patient difficulties. 
 
The Antecedents, Behavior, Consequences (ABC) Model is a formalized model for 
examining behavior (symptoms) in a larger context. It postulates that behaviors are largely 
determined by antecedents (events that precede behavior/thoughts/mood) and 
consequences (events that follow the behavior/thoughts/mood).  
 
The ABC model (see worksheet) is used in a functional assessment. It follows the premise 
that behavior (B) is shaped by antecedents (A) and consequences (C). The antecedent 
occurs before a behavior and may be a trigger for a particular reaction in the patient.  
Behavior is any activity (even a thought or feeling) that the patient exhibits in response to 
an antecedent. Consequences are events that occur after the behavior and direct the 
patient to either continue or discontinue the behavior. Two kinds of consequences are 
examined in a functional assessment: short-term and long-term consequences.  
 
Antecedents:  Antecedents, or events that occur before a behavior, typically elicit 
emotional and physiological responses. Antecedents may be affective (an emotion), 
somatic (a physiological response), behavioral (an act), or cognitive (a thought). They are 
also subject to contextual (situational) and relational (interpersonal) factors. For example, a 
patient who reports depression (behavior) may feel bad when he or she is alone at home 
late at night (contextual antecedent) or better when he or she is around family (relational 
antecedent). Alternatively, he or she may feel depressed by thinking, “I will always be 
alone” (cognitive antecedent). It’s important to remember that antecedents can both 
increase and decrease a particular behavior. 
 
To help your patient identify antecedents, teach him or her to pinpoint conditions that 
affect his or her behavior. 
y 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“What were you feeling right before you did that?”  (Affective) 
“What happens to you physically before this happens? Do you feel sick?”  (Somatic) 
“How do you normally act right before this happens?” (Behavioral) 
“What thoughts go through your mind before this happens?” (Cognitive) 
“Where and when does this usually happen?” (Contextual) 
“Do you do this with everyone, or just when you are around certain people?” (Relational) 
Behaviors:  A behavior is anything the patient does, feels, or thinks immediately following the 
antecedent. Each behavior that your patient displays could potentially include an affective 
component (feelings or moods), a somatic component (bodily sensations such as rapid

<!-- Page 22 -->
21 
heartbeat or stomachache), a behavioral component (what a patient does or doesn’t do), 
and a cognitive component (thoughts or beliefs). 
 
Consequences:  Consequences are categorized as being either positive or negative. 
Positive consequences increase the chances that a behavior will be repeated through the 
experience of something pleasant or the removal of something negative (e.g., do not have 
to do a chore). Negative consequences decrease the occurrence of a behavior, either by 
the presence of something noxious (e.g., being yelled at) or the absence of something 
desired (e.g., a child being grounded from watching TV). Patients tend to repeat behaviors 
that result in something positive or the removal of something negative.  
 
Identifying Consequences. Similarly to identifying antecedents, when you and a patient are 
attempting to identify the consequences of a certain behavior, it is important to explore all 
components of each consequence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When completing a functional assessment, both short- and long-term consequences are 
examined. Short-term consequences tend to be behavioral reinforcers, while long-term 
consequences tend to be negative outcomes. In the case of addiction, the short-term 
consequence of using a substance is intoxication, or escape from a negative mood; the 
long-term consequence may be legal trouble, family problems, or a hangover. 
Understanding the positive and negative consequences of a behavior for a patient helps 
design the timing and nature of intervention. For example, in the case above, an 
intervention would need to follow a noxious antecedent to offset the negative mood it 
causes. Treating the negative mood would then decrease the need for escape through 
substance use. A variety of questions may be used to elucidate a short-term consequence:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“How do you feel immediately after this occurs?” (Affective) 
“Do you have any bodily sensations after this happens, like trembling?” (Somatic) 
“How do you react after this behavior occurs? (Behavioral) 
“What do you think about after this happens?” (Cognitive) 
“Are you in a different place when this behavior ends?” (Contextual) 
“Are there any people who make this behavior worse? Make it better?” (Relational) 
“Does this behavior get you attention in some way?” 
“What good things happen as a result of this behavior?” 
“Does this help you in some way?” 
“Do you feel a certain ‘rush’ from doing this?” 
“Does this behavior help you avoid something you don’t want to do?” 
Case Conceptualization Step 2: Clinical Hypotheses and Treatment Plan  
 
Establishing focused clinical hypotheses based upon the information obtained in Case 
Conceptualization Step #1 serves to direct intervention options and possible treatment 
techniques. These hypotheses may require adaptation as new information becomes 
available during treatment. Clinical hypotheses can either be used exclusively by the 
therapist or can be shared with patients. Generally, sharing this information only improves 
trust and communication between patient and therapist.

<!-- Page 23 -->

A focused clinical hypothesis for a person with depression might be as follows: 
"Since your retirement, you have experienced many life transitions and numerous losses 
(e.g., financial, social, functional). Your thoughts, which used to be largely positive and 
ambitious, are now negative and pessimistic; and you appear to be fearful of the future. In 
reaction to your mood and negative thoughts, you have reduced the number of your 
activities; and you have begun to withdraw from your family." 
   
The end result of case conceptualization is formation of a treatment plan, an agreed-upon 
strategy between patient and therapist that gives direction to the therapeutic process. A 
treatment plan should include a presentation of the causes of the patient's current 
difficulties (e.g., cognitive and behavioral factors creating symptoms or difficulties) and a 
specific plan. When presenting the plan, actively involve the patient and incorporate his or 
her feedback. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example: “In the brief amount of time we have spent together, it appears that we have 
identified some thoughts and behaviors that are likely contributing to your current difficulties. 
In particular, your view of yourself and your future are quite negative, and you have stopped 
doing many things that used to bring you pleasure. My recommendation would be to further 
explore your thoughts and see if we can find a more balanced view of your current 
difficulties. I would also like to talk with you more about re-engaging in activities you used to 
find pleasurable. What do you think about these targets for therapy?"   
Case Conceptualization Step 3: Identifying Possible Treatment Obstacles  
 
It is not uncommon for patients to simply agree with recommendations from their therapist. 
However, it is important to identify potential obstacles to treatment early on to avoid 
setbacks or treatment failures. Asking for frequent feedback from the patient helps to 
reduce over-compliance and serves to include the patient in a collaborative and active 
treatment approach. As part of this collaborative venture, it is important to ask the patient 
whether he or she sees any potential obstacles to treatment. Barriers might include logistic 
difficulties (financial, travel), personal beliefs (concerns about stigma, effectiveness of 
treatment) or interpersonal issues (family not supportive of therapy). 
Tips for Using Case Conceptualization in Brief Therapy 
 
 
Case conceptualization in Brief CBT is much the same as with longer forms of 
treatment with the following exceptions: 
o 
Brief therapy leaves little room for delays in case formulation. 
o 
The time constraints of brief therapy must be considered in all treatment/goal- 
setting endeavors. Treatment goals should be reasonable, measurable and as 
simple as possible.  
o 
Because of limited time, the focus of treatment in Brief CBT also generally limits 
the depth of cognitive interventions. For example, it is quite frequent to 
address automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs as foci of treatment, 
while addressing core beliefs is often difficult. If core beliefs are addressed, this 
usually occurs indirectly through more surface-level intervention techniques or 
at a time when the patient is particularly ready for such work.
