To provide tips on selecting a supervisor / consultant 
 
Introduction 
 
Knowledge about psychotherapy can be broken down into two broad domains – 1) 
knowledge of concepts and 2) knowledge of how to apply concepts. Information 
contained in this manual will provide you with a basic knowledge of CBT concepts and will 
attempt to provide you with practical tips on how to use these concepts. However, 
because the provision of CBT is highly variable, depending on the therapist, patient, and 
treatment setting, applications of CBT will need to be customized and practiced in real- 
world settings. This manual is therefore only the first step toward obtaining information and 
knowledge about how best to apply CBT principles to actual clinical patients. Supervision 
and consultation are two methods to advance CBT practice skills through routine feedback 
and interaction with a CBT trainer. 
 
What is Supervision, and why Is It Important to CBT? 
 
Supervision is designed to a) foster the supervisee's development and b) ensure patient 
welfare and safety by monitoring patient care – see following table:

Supervision versus Consultation 
There is a difference between supervision and consultation. Whereas supervision involves 
the direct oversight of clinical cases over a period of time (often involving evaluation of the 
clinician), consultation refers to a relationship that is designed to assist in professional 
development but does not involve formal oversight of clinical cases and may or may not 
continue over time. In essence, consultation involves a growth-oriented discussion of cases 
or issues without oversight or evaluation.

When? (Indications/Contraindications)  
 
Ideally, supervision or consultation occurs on a regular basis. Typically, for therapists learning 
CBT, supervision/consultation should occur every week or every other week. Monthly 
consultation meetings may be appropriate for licensed practitioners in a more advanced 
stage of psychotherapy training. 
 
How? (Instructions/Handouts)  
 
The following table outlines the most common formats for supervision. The usefulness of 
each procedure will be determined by the goals of supervision and the supervisee’s level of 
training and developmental needs. Exposure to multiple training modalities is seen as most 
effective.

details of a given therapy 
session or case.

recollection (errors 
and omissions)

supervisors to 
monitor and provide 
feedback on the 
"process" of therapy

Selecting a Supervisor/Consultant 
 
The following are characteristics to seek out in selecting a CBT supervisor or consultant: 
1) CBT knowledge and practice experience 
o 
Ideally, CBT supervisors and consultants have received formal training in CBT 
and use CBT in their daily practice settings. 
2) Availability 
o 
For those first learning how to apply CBT, it is highly recommended that you 
identify supervisors/consultants who are available for weekly or bi-weekly 
meetings that involve anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes per meeting. The 
actual length of meetings can be determined by the number of cases being 
reviewed. 
o 
Consider logistical issues in scheduling. Would the supervisor/consultant be 
available for in-person or telephone sessions (in-person is more effective)? 
Consider proximity, travel, and availability of resources (e.g., audio/video 
taping). 
3) Experience with a patient population similar to those you will be serving.
