Module 8: Homework 
 
Objectives 
• 
To understand how homework is introduced and used in Brief CBT 
• 
To understand techniques for increasing homework utility and compliance 
 
What is homework, and why is it a central part of CBT? 
 
Homework is an essential and effective component of Brief CBT. Because of the condensed 
number of sessions in Brief CBT, assignments such as readings, behavior monitoring, and 
practicing new skills should be given to the patient to practice and use outside sessions. 
Homework assignments facilitate patient skill acquisition, treatment compliance, and 
symptom reduction by integrating the concepts learned in sessions into daily life.   
Homework is a key mechanism for facilitating between-session work and progress. 
 
When? (Indications/Contraindications) 
 
Give homework assignments throughout treatment. The nature and frequency of 
assignments is left to your discretion. Consider patient characteristics when assigning 
homework, specifically reading ability, cognitive functioning, level of distress, and 
motivation. During the beginning stage of therapy, suggest homework; but, as therapy 
progresses, encourage the patient to generate between-session activities. This helps the 
patient to continue to use skills outside therapy and after the end of treatment. Some 
patients may be hesitant to participate in homework assignments, so it is your responsibility 
to be open to patient feedback about assignments, give reasons for each task, and 
personalize homework assignments for each patient. 
 
How? (Instructions/Handouts) 
 
Seven Tips for Setting Homework 
 
1. One Size Does Not Fit All. 
Always tailor assignments to patients. Their reading level, desire to change, cognitive 
functioning, and, even, stage of life determine how much and what type of homework 
assignment fits them best. For example, a single, working mother who is also a full-time 
student may not have time to read a complete book as a bibliotherapy assignment. 
Assigning her a small part of the book or an article may be more reasonable. Breaking 
assignments down into smaller parts is also useful. Always consider the patient’s diagnosis 
and presenting problem when assigning homework and ask yourself  
 
 
 
 
 
2. Explain In Detail. 
Knowing the reason for an assignment and how it relates to overall treatment goals helps 
the patient understand why he/she is doing the assignment and also may encourage 
him/her to complete it. Most patients are interested in how certain activities may improve 
their situation or relieve their symptoms. Explain assignments in the context of treatment 
goals and the cognitive model to enhance patient buy-in to the tasks. 
“Can the patient handle this homework, and will it be beneficial to his/her growth?” 
“Could there be a negative result from this assignment; and, if so, is the patient 
prepared to handle it outside session?”

3. Set Homework as a Team. 
Involving the patient in designing and scheduling homework increases the chances he/she 
will complete it. It is also important to get the patient’s agreement to complete the 
homework. Suggest homework assignments, and then ask the patient if you can help make 
adjustments to it. Ask, for example, the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Do you think this is reasonable?” 
“What would you change about the assignment?” 
“Let’s do an example together first. Then we can make changes if we need to.” 
4. Create a Win-Win Situation. 
Do not scold a patient for not completing homework assignments, but also do not dismiss 
their value. If a patient does not finish homework, which is common, you may learn about 
the patient’s level of motivation, ability to follow-through, or level of distress (e.g., too 
depressed to complete it). Failure to complete homework is an opportunity for you to 
evaluate the patient’s reason for noncompliance. The patient may have been anxious 
about completing an assignment incorrectly or may question the utility of the assignment. 
These thoughts are helpful to discuss in session.  
 
5. Start Homework In-Session. 
In the first few sessions after assigning homework, do a few examples with the patient in 
session, when possible. This gives the patient a clearer picture of what is expected and 
allows questions that he/she might have about the homework. It also gives the patient an 
idea how long the homework will take. In subsequent sessions, the patient may start the 
assignment with your assistance to troubleshoot questions about it. 
 
6. Ask About and Review Homework. 
To emphasize the importance of homework, always ask about and review homework the 
session after you assign it. If the patient did not complete homework, use session time, if 
possible, to complete the assignment, which may also help identify the aspects of the skill 
that need to be reviewed. If you do not review homework in session, patients may stop 
completing it.  
 
7. Anticipate and Prepare for Problems. 
With the first few homework assignments, help problem solve the assignment by eliciting 
feedback about it and planning when and how it will be completed. Assignments can be 
scheduled for a particular day and time to overcome barriers, and foreseeable problems 
for completing the assignment at that time can be discussed. For example, if the patient’s 
behavioral activation is to walk for 15 minutes on Wednesday at 4pm, discuss what to do if it 
rains or other factors prevent him/her from completing it. Agree upon and schedule a 
second option (e.g., using treadmill for 15 minutes).

Using Bibliotherapy as Homework 
 
Bibliotherapy, or assigning the patient reading materials relevant to Brief CBT or his/her 
presenting problems, is a useful tool for Brief CBT because it allows the patient to  read 
about his/her disorder or CBT between sessions. Bibliotherapy emphasizes the self-
management focus of CBT and can accelerate therapeutic progress and maintenance of 
changes. Reading materials may be websites, book chapters, or sections of CBT patient 
manuals. Some common examples of CBT bibliotherapy are Mind Over Mood (Greenberger 
& Padesky, 1995) and Feeling Good Handbook (Burns, 1999). 
 
Homework Troubleshooting 
 
Practical Problems  
Occasionally, therapists may encounter a patient who waits until the day before a session 
to do the homework. This is problematic because certain assignments, such as monitoring 
automatic thoughts, are most effective and most accurate when completed in the 
moment. There are many reasons patients may put off doing homework, and your role is to 
explore these reasons in a proactive, nonjudgmental, nonpunitive way. 
 
Sometimes a patient may simply forget to do homework. He/she may have a busy schedule 
or have trouble remembering to complete homework. Using a calendar and scheduling 
time to do homework are useful in this situation and provides the opportunity for time- 
management skill building. 
 
A few assignments described in this text might be difficult for some patients. If a patient is 
having trouble completing an assignment because of the level of difficulty, it is your job to 
explain how to complete it and gauge the patient’s understanding. Some assignments may 
need to be broken down into smaller steps until the patient can fully grasp how it is to be 
completed. 
 
Psychological Problems 
Patients who don’t complete homework might have maladaptive thoughts about 
themselves, the homework assignment, or therapy that need to be addressed. In these 
cases encouragement, thought testing and listing the advantages and disadvantages of 
doing homework may be useful. Though outside the scope of this manual, techniques, such 
as motivational interviewing (Rollnick, et al 1999), may also be used to address the 
ambivalence a patient may feel about homework.  Patient perceptions of importance and 
confidence are very important for non-compliance issues. 
 
Many patients have negative reactions to the word homework. They may feel 
overwhelmed by the perceived time or energy it will take to complete, or concerned that 
therapy is like schoolwork. In giving homework, address any concerns the patient may have 
about time constraints, and explain how long each assignment should take, while working 
with the patient to generate reasonable tasks. If the patient dislikes the term homework, 
work with him/her collaboratively to select another label, such as practice, between-session 
progress, task, or experiment. 
 
Homework may be problematic for patients who are perfectionists or desire to please the 
therapist because they may spend too much time on an assignment or be overly 
concerned about getting the “right answer.” Clarify that the exercise is not about getting

<!-- Page 42 -->
43 
the “right answer,” and that they should concentrate on recording real feelings and 
thoughts and not concern themselves with spelling, grammar, or appearance of the 
assignment. 
 
Therapist Cognition Problems 
Although completion of homework is primarily the patient’s responsibility, sometimes your 
thoughts about an assignment or approach to homework plays a role in noncompliance. 
Check your own thoughts about assigning homework, and determine whether there is 
anything you can adjust in your approach that could better encourage the patient. Ask 
yourself, “Is the assignment too difficult?”, “Did I explain the assignment thoroughly?”, or 
“Have I led the patient to believe that homework is unimportant to therapy?” 
 
Sample Homework Assignments 
Examples of homework that could be assigned for each cognitive and behavioral skill are 
included in each module. Examples of tailoring a homework assignment to a specific case 
are included in Appendix B.
