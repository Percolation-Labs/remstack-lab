Module 10: Challenging Maladaptive Thoughts and Beliefs 
 
Objectives 
• 
To learn techniques for addressing dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs 
• 
To understand and manage potential difficulties using thought records 
 
What are the techniques for challenging maladaptive thought, and why are these 
techniques important for Brief CBT? 
 
Several techniques can be used to challenge dysfunctional thoughts or beliefs. Most are 
used in conjunction with a thought record. Challenging thoughts and beliefs in a 
collaborative, Socratic way allows patients to use their own statements to counter 
dysfunctional thinking. Generating counter-statements based on the data patients bring to 
session increases the believability of the thoughts/beliefs and, thus, the effectiveness of the 
counter thoughts/beliefs.  
 
When? (Indications/Contraindications) 
 
Typically dysfunctional automatic thoughts are the first targets in the cognitive component 
of CBT. Following the introduction of the cognitive model (see [[cbt-patient-orientation|Module 5]]: Orienting patient 
to Brief CBT), and skills for identifying automatic hot thoughts and their accompanying 
emotions (see [[identifying-maladaptive-thoughts|Module 9]]: Identifying Maladaptive Thoughts and Beliefs), techniques for 
challenging hot thoughts are introduced. These techniques should immediately follow the 
session on identifying hot thoughts, to build continuity and familiarity with the skill set and 
instill hope of change after identifying problematic thinking patterns. Although intermediate 
and core beliefs will be challenged in advanced stages of therapy, the techniques are 
similar for challenging thoughts. Many techniques below can be used interchangeably for 
challenging thoughts or beliefs. Brief CBT session time is best used for modifying thoughts or 
beliefs that are tightly held and strongly believed. 
 
How? (Instructions/Handouts) 
 
Socratic questioning is a therapist stance for questioning maladaptive thoughts and beliefs. 
This process involves asking a series of open-ended, brief questions that guide the patient to 
discover his/her idiosyncratic thoughts, feelings, or behaviors associated with a particular 
situation. Socratic questioning is nonjudgmental but is based on the therapist’s insight that 
the original premise of a thought or belief may be untrue; therefore, the questions are 
designed to expose the dysfunctional thought or belief so that it may be challenged.  
 
The Dysfunctional Thought Record (DTR) is the staple of cognitive work in Brief CBT. The first 
three columns (see Thought Record handout on p. 55) are used for identifying troubling 
situations and the accompanying emotions and dysfunctional thoughts. These three 
columns are used in conjunction with [[cbt-homework|Module 8]], in that when the situation thought  
feeling triangle is unfolded, it forms the first three columns of a DTR (see figure).

A seven-column thought record is used to challenge dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs. 
Instructions for completing columns 4-7 are described in detail below. 
 
Once a hot thought and its accompanying emotion have been identified and rated, the 
hot thought is questioned to generate evidence for and against it. Building evidence may 
be introduced in the following way: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example: We have identified a thought that is very powerful for you. You rated this 
thought as 90 out of 100 for sadness.  Before spending a lot of time and energy on this 
thought, I want to know whether or not it is true. Often when people are depressed or 
anxious, they take thoughts like this at face value, without first asking whether it is true. 
Accepting thoughts like this as true would certainly lead to the symptoms you’ve been 
struggling with. If I thought, “I am worthless and can’t do anything right,” I wouldn’t 
want to get out of bed in the morning either, and I would probably feel pretty hopeless 
and sad. When we test a thought like this, we are going to generate evidence for and 
against the thought. It is as though the thought were on trial, and you were a lawyer for 
the case. Remember, you have to be able to prove the evidence you are generating. 
So, now let’s see how your thought stands up …. 
Developing Balanced Thinking 
 
These instructions might be useful to help patients develop balanced thinking: 
1. Help the patient question automatic thoughts by asking 
 
What evidence is there that this thought is true? 
 
What evidence is there that this thought is not true? 
 
What would I tell someone I loved if they were in this situation and had these 
thoughts? 
 
If my automatic thought is true, what is the worst that could happen?  
 
If my automatic thought is true, what is the best thing that could happen?  
 
2. Once evidence has been generated, combine it to form a more balanced thought. This 
thought will likely be much longer and more nuanced than the original hot thought. 
Example: Taking all this information (from columns 4-5) into consideration, what is a 
more balanced thought that more accurately reflects the facts? 
You might want to ask the following questions: 
 
Taking the information into account, is there an alternative way of thinking about the 
situation? 
 
Can someone I trust understand this situation in a different way? 
 
3. Rate the believability of the alternative thought between 0-100). If the thought is not more
than 50 believable, more work is needed to identify an alternative thought. Go back to the 
evidence and keep working.  
 
4. Once a believable alternative thought is generated, re-rate the mood associated with 
the hot thought (0-100) after reading the new thought. Reducing a thought/belief to a 
rating of 0 is not a realistic goal. Instead, a reduction of 30-50 often provides relief. Often

patients will generate new emotions from the alternative thought. However, it is most 
important first to re-rate the old mood before generating new emotions.  
 
The same strategy of generating an alternative thought for a dysfunctional thought is used 
when challenging a core belief. Once the belief is identified, the evidence is weighed and 
a new more balanced belief is generated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary: Completing DTRs 
 
 Identify situation and corresponding thoughts and feelings. 
 Identify cognitive distortions in thoughts (e.g., all or none thinking). 
 Use Socratic questioning to identify hot thought. 
 Elicit and rate emotions associated with hot thought. 
 Rate believability of hot thought. 
 Generate evidence for and against hot thought. 
 Generate alternative thought from evidence. 
 Rate believability of alternative thought. 
 Re-rate emotion of hot thought that is elicited by alternative thought. 
Troubleshooting Thought/Belief Modification 
 
Some patients can see the benefits of doing a thought record immediately, but others 
might need to be motivated to be engaged. It is useful to use positive reinforcement to 
praise the effort of completing a DTR, point out the sections completed correctly, and 
review skills for the sections completed incompletely or inaccurately. If a DTR is assigned for 
homework, it must always be reviewed during the subsequent session. Taking session time to 
review the DTR emphasizes its importance to the patient.  
 
Introducing the DTR as an “experiment” helps alleviate any performance anxiety the 
patient may have about completing it and may generate interest (“Give the DTR a try this 
week, and we’ll see how it works for you. Let me know next session how the experience to 
complete it was. That will help us decide whether or not this is a useful tool for you.”)  
 
Occasionally, a patient will show disinterest in doing the DTR or get tired of it after a while.  
For instances like this, there are other ways you can suggest that the patient can continue 
to attempt the DTR: 
 
 
If a patient complains of never having time to do a DTR when certain situations 
occur, suggest that the patient carry a blank DTR in his/her wallet or purse. 
 
If a patient has done the DTR for awhile and is becoming disinterested, suggest 
doing a “mental” DTR, since he/she is familiar with the process. 
 
Suggest reading old DTRs that have similar situations and automatic thoughts of their 
own. 
 
The patient can verbally dictate a DTR to someone, and have that person write it 
down.

57 
There will not always be an immediate change to a patient’s mood after a thought record 
is completed. It might be necessary to assess why there is no change. It could be attributed 
to the patient’s deeply rooted belief in the automatic thought, to an unchanged underlying 
core belief, or to additional automatic thoughts that have not been evaluated. It is 
necessary to ask: Why was there no mood change after completion of the Thought 
Record? These other questions will also be helpful. 
 
 
Have I described the situation in enough detail? 
 
Did I identify and rate the right moods? 
 
Is the thought I am testing an automatic thought? 
 
Do I believe a dysfunctional core belief is driving this thought? 
 
Did I list multiple thoughts? Do I need more information for each individual thought? 
 
Is there a stronger automatic thought that I have not put in my Thought Record? 
 
Do I believe the alternative thought? What other alternative thoughts are available? 
 
If thought/belief testing is ineffective in reducing negative mood, you can also explore the 
advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a thought/belief. As we know, there are 
many disadvantages to negative beliefs we have, but there are also advantages. The 
patient’s perceptions of the advantages may be obstructing the change process. 
Understanding the function of the thought/belief for the patient may be useful in clarifying 
why certain thoughts/beliefs are resistant to modification. The therapist should evaluate 
both the advantages and disadvantages of a patient’s assumptions and beliefs, but in 
doing so work to diminish the advantages and highlight the disadvantages. 
 
Often, when working to modify thoughts and beliefs, the patient may find evidence that 
supports the negative belief instead of evidence that contradicts it. If there is a good 
amount of evidence to support that negative core belief, then problem solving, rather then 
thought testing, is an appropriate strategy (see [[cbt-problem-solving|Module 12]]). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seven Tips for Effective DTRs 
 
1. 
You must have mastered the use of DTR before introducing it to patients. 
2. 
Reinforce and make sure that the patient believes in the cognitive model being used. 
3. 
Teach the DTR in two sections: (1) The first three columns; Situation, Automatic 
thought(s), and Emotion(s), and (2) the last four columns; Evidence for and against 
thought, Alternative response, and New rating of emotion. 
4. 
Use the patient’s exact words when recording thoughts and feelings. Working with 
thoughts verbatim preserves the emotions or personal meaning for each thought. 
5. 
The patient should be able to adequately complete the first three columns of the DTR 
before learning about the last four columns. 
6. 
Completing a DTR is a skill and, like other Brief CBT skills, requires practice. Success 
depends on the patient’s understanding of the steps. Encourage the patient to take 
time with the skill and work through any frustration. 
7. 
If the patient is not collaborative in completing the DTR in session or does not complete 
DTR homework, it is possible that he or she might have automatic thoughts about this 
type of exercise. Ask the patient to create a thought record of the DTR experience.

Example Homework Assignments 
1. List the advantages and disadvantages of keeping a Thought Record. 
2. Use an old Thought Record and analyze it using the Automatic Thought Questions 
we have discussed. 
3. Complete the first three columns of a thought record for homework, and complete 
columns 4-7 with you in session.
