# Automatic Thoughts

Automatic thoughts are brief streams of thought about ourselves and others that occur spontaneously throughout the day.

## Definition

An **automatic thought** is a quick, evaluative thought that occurs in response to a situation:

- Occurs rapidly and often outside awareness
- Feels believable in the moment
- Is situation-specific
- Directly influences emotions and behaviors
