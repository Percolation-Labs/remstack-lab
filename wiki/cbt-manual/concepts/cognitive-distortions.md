# Cognitive Distortions

Cognitive distortions are systematic errors in thinking that maintain negative automatic thoughts.

## Common Distortions

| Distortion | Example |
|------------|---------|
| **All-or-Nothing** | "If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure" |
| **Catastrophizing** | "This will ruin everything" |
| **Mind Reading** | "She thinks I'm stupid" |
| **Fortune Telling** | "I know it will go badly" |
| **Emotional Reasoning** | "I feel it, so it must be true" |
| **Overgeneralization** | "I always mess up" |
| **Mental Filter** | Focusing only on negatives |
| **Should Statements** | "I should be able to handle this" |
| **Labeling** | "I'm a loser" |
| **Personalization** | "It's all my fault" |
