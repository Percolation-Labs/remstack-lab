# Socratic Questioning

Socratic questioning uses guided discovery through questions to help patients examine their thoughts.

## Key Principles

- **Collaborative** - Working together, not lecturing
- **Curious** - Genuine interest
- **Nonjudgmental** - Exploring, not criticizing
- **Guided** - Moving toward insight

## Question Types

### Evidence Questions
- "What's the evidence for this thought?"
- "What's the evidence against it?"

### Alternative Questions
- "Is there another way to look at this?"
- "What would you tell a friend?"

### Implication Questions
- "What's the worst that could happen?"
- "Could you cope if it did?"

### Usefulness Questions
- "How does thinking this way affect you?"
- "Does this thought help or hurt you?"
