# Core Beliefs

Core beliefs are deep, fundamental beliefs about oneself, others, and the world formed in childhood.

## Categories

### Interpersonal
- "I am unlovable"
- "I am unworthy"
- "I will be abandoned"

### Achievement
- "I am incompetent"
- "I am a failure"
- "I am helpless"

## In Brief CBT

Core beliefs are typically **not** the primary target because:
- They're deeply ingrained and change slowly
- Limited sessions are better spent on automatic thoughts
- Changing thoughts can indirectly influence beliefs

## The Downward Arrow

To identify core beliefs, keep asking "What does that mean about you?" until reaching a global statement.
