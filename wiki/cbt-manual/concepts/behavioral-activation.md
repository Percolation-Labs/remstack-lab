# Behavioral Activation

Behavioral activation increases patient activity and access to reinforcing situations.

## The Depression Cycle

```
Low Mood → Decreased Activity → Fewer Rewards → Lower Mood → More Avoidance
```

## Breaking the Cycle

1. **Re-introduce** prior pleasant activities
2. **Introduce** new pleasant activities
3. **Active coping** - accomplishment tasks

## Activity Scheduling

| Time | Activity | Mood (0-10) | Pleasure | Mastery |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 9am | Walk | 5 | 4 | 3 |
| 10am | Call friend | 6 | 5 | 4 |

## Key Insight

**Action comes before motivation** - don't wait to "feel like it."
