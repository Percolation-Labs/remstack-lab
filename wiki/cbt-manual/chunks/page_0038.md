BRIDGING SESSIONS 
 
 
1. What main points did we reach in our last session? What did you learn from last 
session? Did anything come to mind in the past week about our last session that 
you’d like me to know or that you’d like to discuss? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Were you uncomfortable about anything we talked about in our last session? Is there 
anything you wish we had discussed that we didn’t?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. How is your mood? (How is your physical health?) Compared with last week, is it 
better or worse? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. What treatment goals would you like to work on today? What problems would you 
like to put on the agenda?
