Selecting a Supervisor/Consultant 
 
The following are characteristics to seek out in selecting a CBT supervisor or consultant: 
1) CBT knowledge and practice experience 
o 
Ideally, CBT supervisors and consultants have received formal training in CBT 
and use CBT in their daily practice settings. 
2) Availability 
o 
For those first learning how to apply CBT, it is highly recommended that you 
identify supervisors/consultants who are available for weekly or bi-weekly 
meetings that involve anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes per meeting. The 
actual length of meetings can be determined by the number of cases being 
reviewed. 
o 
Consider logistical issues in scheduling. Would the supervisor/consultant be 
available for in-person or telephone sessions (in-person is more effective)? 
Consider proximity, travel, and availability of resources (e.g., audio/video 
taping). 
3) Experience with a patient population similar to those you will be serving.
