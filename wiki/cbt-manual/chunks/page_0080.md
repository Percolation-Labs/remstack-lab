Other Guided Imagery Scene Suggestions: 
 
• 
A garden where you watch big, beautiful clouds in a blue sky, while you 
inhale the scent of flowers and feel a gentle breeze on your skin as the 
sunshine warms you. 
 
• 
A mountain scene where you feel calm and relaxed as you look out over the 
valley. Just you and the vegetation and you dip your feet into a cool 
mountain stream; and let your foot rest on a big, slippery stone as the sunshine 
warms you and the wind blows through the trees. 
 
• 
Advanced scenarios developed with assistance of patient (family, past 
experiences, etc).
