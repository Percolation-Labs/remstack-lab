This manual is designed for mental health practitioners who want to establish 
a solid foundation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills. Concepts
contained in the manual detail the basic steps needed to provide CBT
(“Practicing CBT 101”) with the intent that users will feel increasingly 
comfortable conducting CBT. The manual is not designed for advanced 
CBT practitioners. 
Instructional material in this program is designed to be used within the 
context of a psychotherapy supervisory relationship to ensure appropriate 
application of the training materials and timely feedback, which are viewed 
as critical to the development of CBT skills. 
The content of this manual is a compilation of foundational works on CBT,
such as Judith Beck’s (1995) Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond, with the 
addition of key skills needed for developing CBT therapists. The information 
is condensed and packaged to be highly applicable for use in a brief 
therapy model and to aid in rapid training.
