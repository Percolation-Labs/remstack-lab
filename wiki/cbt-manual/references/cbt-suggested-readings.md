BRIDGING SESSIONS 
 
 
1. What main points did we reach in our last session? What did you learn 
from last session? Did anything come to mind in the past week about our 
last session that you’d like me to know or that you’d like to discuss? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Were you uncomfortable about anything we talked about in our last 
session? Is there any thing you wish we had discussed that we didn’t?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. How is your mood? Compared with last week, is it better or worse? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. What treatment goals would you like to work on today? What problems 
would you like to put on the agenda? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. What homework did you attempt or complete for last session? What did 
you learn from doing it?

Cognitive Distortions 
1. All-or-Nothing Thinking: Viewing situations on one extreme or another instead of on a 
continuum. 
Ex. “If my child does bad things, it’s because I am a bad parent.” 
 
2. Catastrophizing: Predicting only negative outcomes for the future. 
Ex. “If I fail my final, my life will be over.” 
3. Disqualifying or Discounting the Positive: Telling yourself that the good things that happen 
to you don’t count.  
Ex. “My daughter told her friend that I was the best Dad in the world, but I’m sure 
she was just being nice.” 
4. Emotional Reasoning: Feeling about something overrules facts to the contrary. 
Ex. “Even though Steve is here at work late everyday, I know I work harder than 
anyone else at my job.” 
5. Labeling: Giving someone or something a label without finding out more about it/them. 
Ex. “My daughter would never do anything I disapproved of.” 
6. Magnification/Minimization: Emphasizing the negative or downplaying the positive of a 
situation. 
Ex. “My professor said he made some corrections on my paper, so I know I’ll 
probably fail the class.” 
7. Mental Filter/Tunnel Vision: Placing all your attention on the negatives of a situation or 
seeing only the negatives of a situation.. 
Ex. “My husband says he wished I was better at housekeeping, so I must be a 
lousy wife.” 
EX. “My daughter’s boyfriend got suspended from school. He’s a loser and won’t 
ever amount to anything.” 
8. Mind Reading: Believing you know what others are thinking. 
Ex. “My house was dirty when my friends came over, so I know they think I’m a 
slob.” 
9. Overgeneralization: Making an overall negative conclusion beyond the current situation. 
Ex. “My husband didn’t kiss me when he came home this evening. Maybe he 
doesn’t love me anymore.” 
10. Personalization: Thinking the negative behavior of others has something to do with you. 
Ex. “My daughter has been pretty quiet today. I wonder what I did to upset her.” 
11. “Should” and “Must” Statements: Having a concrete idea of how people should behave. 
Ex. “I should get all A’s to be a good student.”

Tensing Instructions 
 
 
 Model each tension procedure: 
 
Dominant arm:  
Make a fist and tense biceps; pull wrist upward while pushing elbow down against the arm 
of chair or bed. 
 
Nondominant arm:   
Same as above. 
 
Forehead, lower cheeks and jaw:  
Lift eyebrows as high as possible, bite teeth together and pull corners of mouth tightly. 
 
Neck and throat:   
Pull chin down toward chest; at the same time, try to prevent it from actually touching the 
chest. Counterpose muscles in front part of neck against those in the back part of neck. 
 
Shoulders, chest, and upper back/abdomen:   
Take a deep breath and hold it. At the same time, pull the shoulder blades back and 
together, trying to make them touch. Try to keep your arms as relaxed as possible while 
tensing this muscle group. At the same time make stomach hard by pressing it out, as if 
someone were going to hit you in the stomach. 
 
Dominant leg:   
Lift foot off the floor, and push down on the chair with thigh. 
 
Nondominant leg:   
Same as above.

<!-- Page 102 -->
106 
Deep-Breathing Technique 
 
Step #1:  Put one hand on your abdomen, with the little finger about 1 inch above the 
navel, and place one hand on your chest.  
 
Step #2:  Pay attention to your breathing (pause for several seconds to assess your 
breathing). Ideally, the hand on the abdomen should be moving, while the hand over the 
chest remains still. This ensures that the breaths are deep.  
 
Step #3:   Take deeper breaths by getting the hand over the stomach to move, while 
having little movement of the hand over the chest.  
 
NOTE:  If you have a lung or heart condition and you are having difficulty with this exercise, 
slow the process down to your comfort level.   
 
Step #4: Continue your slow, even, deep breaths. To pace yourself, you can say the words in 
and out slowly while taking breaths. Inhalations and exhalations should build to 
approximately 3 seconds in duration. 
 
Step #5:  Repeat the breathing exercise three or more times. 
 
Other tips for deep breathing: 
1) Inhale through your nose and out your mouth. 
2) Purse your lips (as if blowing out hot soup) while exhaling. 
3) Do not pause between inhales and exhales. 
4) Close your eyes during the exercise. 
5) Use mantra such as “relax” during each exhale 
6) Pair up deep breathing with imagery once you have mastered the breathing skills. 
7) REMEMBER: Deep breathing is a portable skill that can be used in a variety of 
situations and relatively without notice of others.

Imagery:  Example Scripts

 Once your whole body feels relaxed, travel to your favorite place… it can be any time period 
 or any place. This place is calm and safe… there are no worries here…  Look around this

 you hear in this place you are imagining?  How does this special place smell?  Walk around a 
l ittle and take in all the wonderful sights…  Feel the air around you and relax…. The air is fresh, 
an
 
d it’s easy to breathe here. Pay attention to how your body feels.…. Say to yourself, “I am 
t otally relaxed… without worries… all the tension has drained away from my body.”  Take a 
m
 oment to fully experience your favorite place…. Notice the sounds, sights, smells, and how it 
f eels to be in this very special place. Remember that you can visit this place as often as you 
wan
 
t and that it is wonderful. Say to yourself, “I am relaxed here… this place is special and 
m
 akes me feel at peace.”

a vailable to you, and you find that you feel relaxed even after you leave. 
Script # 2 – The Beach: 
   Imagine yourself walking down a sandy beach. The sand is white and warm between your 
 toes. You are looking out over the calm, blue water. The waves are gently lapping at the 
 shore. You feel the pleasant warmth of the sun on your skin… it’s a perfectly comfortable 
 temperature outside. Breathe in deeply. There is a gentle breeze, and the sun is shining. Big, 
 cotton-like clouds drift by as you hear sea gulls in the distance.  You taste traces of salt on 
 your lips. You are completely relaxed… there are no worries on this beach. There is nothing to 
 distract you from feeling tranquil. Worries drift away. Notice the sounds, sights, smells, and how
 it feels to be in this very special place.  
 
 Feel the sand under your feet… you decide to stretch out on the warm, fine white sand… 
 breathe deeply… feel the warm air. Your body is completely relaxed, and you have an 
overall feeling of warmth and comfort. You look up as the clouds pass by slowly across the 
 beautiful blue sky. You are feeling rejuvenated and completely at peace. Remember that 
 you can visit this place as often as you want and that it is wonderful. Say to yourself, “I am 
 relaxed here… this place is special and makes me feel peaceful and content.” 
 
 When you are done with your visit, open your eyes and stay in your comfortable position. 
 Continue to breathe smoothly, in a relaxed and rhythmic fashion; take as long as you want to 
 enjoy and relax. You feel at ease knowing your special place is always available to you, and 
 you find that you feel relaxed even after you leave.

Script #3 – The Meadows: 
 
 
Imagine yourself walking through a lovely meadow. The breeze feels pleasant against your 
skin. You are looking out over the calm, beautiful green grass. The blades of grass are gently 
swaying in the breeze. You feel the pleasant warmth of the sun on your skin… it’s a perfectly 
comfortable temperature outside. Breathe in deeply. There is a gentle breeze, and the sun is 
shining. Big, cotton-like clouds drift by as you hear birds in the distance.  You hear the wind 
blow gently through the trees. You taste the sweet summer air on your lips. You are 
completely relaxed… there are no worries in this meadow. There is nothing to distract you 
from feeling tranquil. Worries drift away. Notice the sounds, sights, smells, and how it feels to 
be in this very special place.  
Feel the cool grass under your feet… you decide to stretch out on the soft, cushiony grass… 
breathe deeply… feel the warm air. Your body is completely relaxed, and you have an 
overall feeling of warmth and comfort. You look up as the clouds pass by slowly across the 
beautiful blue sky. You are feeling rejuvenated and completely at peace. Remember that 
you can visit this place as often as you want and that it is wonderful. Say to yourself, “I am 
relaxed here… this place is special and makes me feel peaceful and content.” 
When you are done with your visit, open your eyes and stay in your comfortable position.

enjoy and relax. You feel at ease knowing your special place is always available to you, and 
you find that you feel relaxed even after you leave. 
Other Guided Imagery Scene Suggestions: 
 
• 
A garden where you watch big, beautiful clouds in a blue sky, while you inhale the 
scent of flowers and feel a gentle breeze on your skin as the sunshine warms you. 
 
• 
A mountain scene where you feel calm and relaxed as you look out over the 
valley. Just you and the vegetation, and you dip your feet into a cool mountain 
stream, and let your foot rest on a big, slippery stone as the sunshine warms you 
and  the wind blows through the trees. 
 
• 
Advanced scenarios developed with assistance of patient (family, past 
experiences, etc).

Sample Brief CBT Outline #1 
 
Patient Description 
Maria is a 60-year-old airline pilot who is about to retire from 15 years of flying. Maria was 
diagnosed with Type II diabetes 5 years ago and has had difficulties maintaining her health 
since that time. She has suffered bouts of severe fatigue and dizziness. Maria says that flying 
is her “first love,” but that it has become increasingly dangerous for her to fly. She states that 
she “feels like a failure” because she worked so hard to become a pilot and now “it is over.” 
Maria says that she is usually a very active person but has lost interest in her hobbies and 
doesn’t have the energy to do them, anyway. She says that her depression has been 
worsened by her deteriorating health. 
 
Case Conceptualization: Maria is experiencing depression in response to a diagnosis of 
diabetes. She is unsure how to change her thoughts and behaviors to adjust to her new 
medical condition. Therapy will aid her adjustment by targeting dysfunctional thoughts 
about being a “failure” and exploring and increasing the things that she enjoys and feels a 
sense of achievement from, both for work and recreation.

Sample Brief CBT Outline #2 
 
Patient Description 
James is a 24-year-old college student on a full academic scholarship. He called the 
therapist to discuss his feelings of anxiety and whether there is anything that can help him 
“calm his nerves.” James said that he is used to getting anxious in certain situations, but that 
it is starting to affect all areas of his life. He says that he doesn’t have a girlfriend because 
he gets “too freaked out” to ask anyone on a date. He also says that his anxiety is starting to 
affect his grades because he gets so nervous during exams that he breaks into a cold 
sweat and cannot concentrate. He wants to be able to control his anxiety but feels there is 
no hope. 
 
Case Conceptualization: James is experiencing cognitive and physiological anxiety in 
response to evaluative situations. Therapy will focus on stress-management skills for his 
physiological symptoms and identifying dysfunctional thoughts or worries about his 
performance in academic and social situations. Specifically, therapy will identify 
catastrophic thoughts he has about failure.
